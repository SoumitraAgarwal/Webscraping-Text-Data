Sesame Street,"You gotta take care of that smile 
Take care of that grin 
That happening place 
Right there on your face 
Between your nose and your chin 
You gotta take care of that smile 
Take care of that grin 
Take care of that smile 

You gotta take care of that smile 
Keep keeping it bright! 
That wonderful glow 
That shimmer that shows me 
That you are feeling alright 
You gotta take care of that smile 
Take care of that grin 
Take care of that smile 

You're gonna need it 
You're gonna wear it 
Morning, noon and night 
You gotta scrub it 
You gotta rinse it 
To keep it pearly white 

You gotta take care of that smile 
Each tooth is a star 
And when they all shine 
They tell me how fine 
How fine you really are 
You gotta take care that they last 
For a long long while 
Take care of that smile

Sesame Street,"I can't think of anything that's dumber 
To a grouch, Christmas is a bummer! 

Beaming faces everywhere, happiness is in the air 
I'm telling you, it isn't fair! 
I hate Christmas! 

People loaded with good will, giving presents, what a thrill 
That slushy nonsense makes me ill 
I hate Christmas! 

I'd rather have a holiday like normal grouches do 
Instead of getting presents, they take presents back from you 
Heh heh 

Here comes Santa, girls and boys 
So, who needs that big red noise! 
I'll tell him where to put his toys 
I hate Christmas! 

And if you want the truth, I ain't so crazy about Thanksgiving or Labor Day either! 
Christmas carols to be sung, decorations to be hung 
Oh, yeah? Well, I stick out my tongue! 
I hate Christmas! 

Christmas bells play loud and strong 
Hurts my ears, all that ding dong 
Besides it goes on much too long 
I hate Christmas! 

I'd rather have a holiday with a lot less joy and flash 
With a lot less cheerful smiling, and a lot more dirty trash, yeah! 

Christmas Day is almost here 
When it's over, then I cheer 
I'm glad it's only once a year 
I hate Christmas!",I Hate Christmas

Sesame Street,"In old Transylvania when I was a lad
Our castle was poor but we never were sad
We learned to be happy
We'd dance round the hall
And learning to count was the key to it all
By counting each count I knew just where to start
And one special step has stayed close to my heart

One two three, spread out the cape
One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please
One two three, counting with ease
One two three, doing the batty bat
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
One two three count
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
won't you dance with me doing the batty bat

So now in my own castle I can enjoy
This wonderful dance that I learned as a boy
I see just how wise was my whole family
They taught me to count and so now look at me
I'm counting and dancing and I swear that it's true
If you do the same you will be happy too

One two three, twirl round the floor

He's gonna put the trash in a can.

And then we want it back so much
Nobody ever warned youâ?¦

Breathe in, take in it deep
Cross your heart, it's yours for you to keep
Wishful: I guess I never was
And I will breathe in, take in it deep
Cross your heart, it's yours for you to keep
Wishful: I guess I never was

(And I will keep, pieces of you alive in me.)
I am looking up now, death can't change us

I am looking up now, death can't change us
I will, stand alone
I will, learn from this, I will
I will, mourn the loss and I will be stronger

Set Your Goals,"Shouting words at a mirror
Trying to find the hero
I don't want to let any of you down

I see me on the floor of a room inside
My own house with a set of darker eyes
Distortion shows row to open doors
I closed for good reasons years before

Growing up I was told one too many times
I'd never be good enough never be alright
See I'm an equal like you with fears
I'm not above or below My only home is here
Want you to know I sometimes let go

Trying to find the hero
They all say I am
The voice behind these verses
Is still so far from perfect
I don't want to let any of you down

Kick kick kick myself numbed up to reacquaint with hell
Lost touch and stared off into doubt
Depersonalized in a cloud
Trading afflictions for imperfections

They all say I am
The voice behind these verses
Is still so far from perfect
I don't want to let any of you down

Because I have troubles I hide
And emotions that I cry
And I am not strong sometimes
I too need song to save my life

Run from self harm
Experiencing alterations

And all the sacrifices for the songs?
Will you even look back when it's gone (it’s gone)
When there's nobody left to sing along?

The candle's burning at both ends.

A brighter future's on the rise.
I'll leave commitments pending.
The worst year of my life is ending.

The hours counting down, and it's all over now.

La main près du flingue et l'flingue encore plus près d'l'oseille
Il en a fallu des couilles à travers ce calvaire
On aimait la castagne il me surnommait kader le bras d'fer
J'étais plutôt du genre à mener à terme l'affaire
Sans m'soucier des reproches que la mater allait m'faire

Moi c'est Esco, et Pierrot il venait dans mon bar
Au passage mon établissement c'est le Esco-bar
C'est chez moi qu'on prend les armes et qu'les cerveaux transpirent
Braquer la banque sans faire miauler la tirelire
Professionnel dans l'boulot, y'a pas d'tulipe dans l'canon

Car on était 8 dans un F4, cité du Parc
Quand tu fais la terreur
C'est qu'tu connais pas l'efficacité d'une claque
Avec les bagues vers l'intérieur
D'une mère qui vient de tomber sur du shit et du talc
Et ouais pour elle c'est du talc
Elle a pas vu Scarface garçon
Sa série a elle c'était Châteauvallon

J'veux déjà la Winchester canon long, Silvester Stallon'
J'assiste a leurs arrestations au milieu du salon
Du coup j'crève mes ballons, j'me console avec ma Super Nintendo

Les cambriolages m'ont surtout niqué l'dos

Qu'mieux vaut être esclave chez Dieu que roi chez Satan
De toujours partager notre pain
Et qu'si les keufs veulent t'défoncer au bottin
Jamais dénoncer nos copains, jamais balance les partenaires

Mais t'inquiète, j'm'arrêtais toujours avant que ca saigne
Et à l'époque , j'mettais des slips j'avais pas de caleçon
Pour t'dire j'avais pas encore d'sperme juste la sensation
J'tirais dessus comme un fou espérant la voir s'rallonger
Galère la seule téloche c'était dans la salle à manger
Donc, j'devais attendre qu'ils aillent tous se coucher
Moi je m'essuyais dans tout c'que je pouvais trouver
J'usais tout le papier toilette mais pas pour me moucher
J'allais dans la salle d'eau ils entendaient pas l'eau couler
J'étais grillé, mais il m'en fallait encore une
J'étais suspect d'regarder les clips a minuit sans le volume
Sur la 13 y'avait des clips sur la 19 des films de scouz
J'ai dû en écouler des litres de shploutch
Pour en faire une bite de val-che
J'ai dû l'astiquer ma bite de schtroumpf

Les DVD, j'les ai jamais fait déné
J'ai cru dur comme fer au coup d'la passoire d'vant la télé
Avoue un p'tit coup d'pougnette ça fait du bien aux coucougnettes
Sur mon survêt c'était des taches blanches pas des trous de boulettes
Une p'tite avant les cours, c'est meilleur quand c'est court
C'est pas les meufs c'est les pages Playboy qu'on s'faisait nétour
Partout en séjour en vacances fallait qu'j'laisse ma trace
Que j'suicide mes orphelins sans jamais me faire cramax
Jamais sauf quand c'est ma mère qui ramasse les chaussettes
Et qu'en les déroulant ca fasse le bruit du scotch mec
J'aurais dû mettre une clochette au dessus d'la te-por
Pour avoir l'temps d'mettre Eject et de cacher ma cassette de faire croire que j'dors
Alors que sous ma couette c'est une salle de sport

Si elle m'engueule, elle est ingrate
J'la trompe avec ma main gauche ma main gauche avec ma main droite
J'crois qu'j'vais lui reprendre les clefs de l'appart
Elle m'a trop surprise, la tête écarlate, en train d'me graisser la patte
J'trompais Julia avec Tabatha
Katsumi avec Draghixa
J'trompe mes cassettes vidéo entre elles
J'adore quand mon p'tit écran m'écarte ses jambes de sauterelle
J'trompe Dolly Golden avec Yasmine

Qu’a pas raté qu’l’avion comme Macauley Culckin
Qui veut que son passé soit remaquillé comme Kiss
Nique les lécheurs de croupes
Les commissariats de Paris détiennent la coupe des plus grands leveurs de coudes
Ex-meneurs de troupes, semeurs de troubles
Quand mes potes tombent de bécanes ma mère viens les recoudre
Ét ouais ma couille c’est au kegré qu’on va se restaurer
On est la jeunesse endiablée
On enfarine sans regret la jeunesse dorée
La mal-bouffe nous laisser avec brio une brioche
J’suis pas de ces mioches qu’on été voir Bambi au cinoche
Une vie violente, tu peux te manger une barre de fer dans le crâne
Comme taper des barres de rire au ventre
Trop macho pour avoir une femme gouvernante
Une chance sur deux d'avoir des billets recouvert d'encre

On rit pour masquer nos peines on est marqué par la haine
C’est l'asile à ciel ouvert, du poison dans les veines
Se faire du mal, à nous mêmes, c’est la nature humaine

J’rigole frère car à défaut de rire, je picole sévère
J’veux plus jamais que la haine pilote mes nerfs
On nous a lâché dans le tier-quar comme des p’tits Rotweillers
À renifler l'odeur d’la merde a être vif comme l'éclair
Ma mère c’est pas une caille mec c’est une Al quaïdette
Si tu me balances elle te découpe comme Simone Weber
Ça criquette à c't'heure ci plus besoin de revolver
Ton ennemi te renverses alors qu’il ya le petit bonhomme vert
Et même si j’suis expressif comme un rideau de fer
Les yeux d’un môme triste m'affaiblisse
Comme si j’étais atteins dee la maladie des os de verre
Je veux pas faire la une du journal du hard a la rubrique fait d'ovaire
Capiche? En gros me fait pas un gosse dans le dos, nan
Ou un avortement coup de part-choc allemand te sera offert
On a tous été par-choqué psychologiquement
Si la faucheuse m’a sur sa liste je change de nom chez le faussaire
À Noël on décorait pas le conifère
J’voyais ma mère dans son Rocking chair, abrutie au somnifère
Mais en somme, j’pouvais rien y faire

On rit pour masquer nos peines on est marqué par la haine
C’est l'asile à ciel ouvert, du poison dans les veines
Se faire du mal, à nous mêmes, c’est la nature humaine

Je rigole frère pour oublier que des truc me surine l'âme
Que pour des histoires de terrain y’a des grosses fusillades
Qu’une p’tite balle peut suffir à coucher un rugbyman
Qu’on reconnaîtra du meurtrier que son blouzon Furigan
Papapa! Batard!
Que mon pote et sa malette reviendront pas du Surinam
Que face au mal-être, se taper des barres est notre unique arme
Dur de se dire qu’on reverra plus Hicham
À cause d’un casque de becanne
Il est monté sur sa moto avec la classe de Beckham
Aujourd’hui le lieu du drame est recouvert de liasses de pétales
Allah ya larmou

On rit pour masquer nos peines on est marqué par la haine
C’est l'asile à ciel ouvert, du poison dans les veines
Se faire du mal, à nous-mêmes, c’est la nature humaine

Je vais te raconter l'histoire de Tonino

Totino, c'est la voix off des cas-sos
Des McGyver, du hebs qui s'font la sauce
Qui fabriquent seuls la chauffe
Avant lui aussi engraissaient les rats du patio
Aujourd'hui son chauffeur l'attend dans sa Murcielago
Il donne toujours a ceux qu'ont pas
Et sache qu'une Pellegrino
Ne fera pas digérer la délation d'un comparse
Et que c'est ton crane qu'il faut qu'on casse
Si t'as un compas dans l'oeil quand il s’agit de faire sa compta wow
Il bombarde, il déboule sur les boulevards d'paris
Armé, bourré comme les p’tits fils de Kadhafi
Il est friand d'évasions à la scie
Quand il sort avec sa cavalerie
C'est un défilé d'chez Cavalli
Il s'entraine à cavaler car en ce moment chez les keufs
Ils sont en train de serrer un max les lasc' et les keups
Mais y'a que Ya Rabbi qui lui fait reu-p
Il s'entraine a rer-ti sur les cannettes de 7'ups

Il a un gros Beretta, Totino la mafia
Il fume des Cohibas, Totino la mafia
Il boit que d'la vodka, Totino la mafia
Il mange que des pizzas, Totino la mafia
Il a l'cul entre deux mafias, Totino
Russia, Italia, Totino
Margarita, Zubrowska, Totino
Allez joue avec Totino la mafia

Il a les chargeurs garnis comme les bouquets d'fleurs d'Interflora
Fini la fête foraine
A c't'heure la il défouraille pour des bons au porteur
Il t'fera la bouche en coeur
Quand il s'offrira des nuits à l'hôtel Astoria
Sur la tête des chiots
Il aime trop les ppes-sa
Il jettera tout dans les ttes-chio
Si ça pue les re-shta
Ouais pépère le chat
Il déambule la noche
Déforme la haute couture avec son corps amoché
Jusqu'au resto il est filoché
Ses femmes cachent ses pistolets
Elles s'parfument pas chez Yves Rocher
T'es fou j'ai Van Cleef & Arpels
Il est à zeul' ma gueule
Il a les feuilles d'la Brinks dans larfeuille
La Rolex d'Augusto Pinochet
Ca fait sbwax des qu'ses plombs font des ricochets

Avec son quota d'poiles sur l'torse
Tu seras son pote
Si tu sautes la salle du coffre
Totino a un rêve depuis tout mioche
Voir le banquier ligoté avec du scotch
Faut lui couper l'doigt pour prendre son louis d'or
Il est fagoté comme un milord
Son deuxième blaze c'est Igor
Personne sait où il dort, c'est un taulier
Il tringle toujours en criant ""Na zdrowie!""
Petite barbe au collier
Il laisse toujours des gouttes sur la cuvette
Si tu veux lui parler sors la calculette
Ca fait belle lurette qu'il fait des bracos d'bonhomme
Il paranoï il voit partout des chapeaux d'cowboy

Il a un gros Beretta, Totino la mafia

Insolents, on sait vi-sèr' des sons lourds
Prêts a salir
Coûte que coûte on veut les salaires
Coups d'couteau dans sa mère
L'rap crève, arme, guerre
Micros en l'air
Tout l'monde à terre: temblement d'ter-ter
C'est Aulnay, 2SK'Prod, tes potos connaissent
93.6, pé-cou tes cojones

Tremblement d'ter-ter
C'est un tremblement d'ter-ter

On roule dans des caisses d'occase
La marijuana vient d'Tijuana
Les balles qu'on tire, wallah, viennent du Caucase
La fumée s'propage comme des phéromones
Starfoullah l'héritage qu'on a offert aux mômes
Avec classe, on s'échappe par l'vasistas
Face au fisc on balise pas
Vu qu'à la douane les valises passent
T'façon on a jamais aimé Rambo, Tarzan
Nos idoles sont ceux qui vendent des kilos d'pavot afghan

J'suis le côté diabolique de Serge Gainsbourg
J'connais le diagnostic mais j'espère que les médecins s'gourent
J'festoie fils: serre-moi un verre d'vin rouge
J'm'esquinte, j'souffre, j'suis quelqu'un d'louche
Je fatigue Satan
Crois pas qu'la Police arrive à temps
Ou qu'ça tire à blanc dans la galerie marchande
Je fabrique l'argent, la famille attend
Qu'j'ramène entre les dents le string de Fanny Ardant

Envoie les clefs du TT, j'me transforme en virtuose
J'mets des grosses fessées sur des p'tits culs roses
Vote pour moi sur ""chien-d'la-casse.fr""
J'te regarde de travers si tu cherches moi les vers
J'pue l'Jack Daniel, j'suis l'fils caché d'Gargamel
J'm'en vais danser l'disco avec deux-trois chattes d'Asnières
On s'entraîne au tir au bois d'Achères
Ambiance murder, pas d'voice au vocoder
C'est Giorgio Moroder

Sur moi, ne lé-par pas
Car chez nous la trahison ne se répare pas
On prend les sens interdits
T'rentre dedans comme la vachette d'Intervilles
Crois pas qu'chez nous c'est fantastique
À mettre la cagoule, les gants en plastique
Les 'tasses de tess', c'est pas ma tasse de thé
Pour les p'tis gars du Seize: fais des traces de C

Quand on était p'tits, les anciens nous envoyaient acheter des canettes
Aujourd'hui ils nous sucent la bite pour qu'on leur avance une galette
C'est la galère ouais, mais nique sa mère, on a l'feeling
Investir dans un calibre c'est mieux que d'faire d'l'haltérophilie
À la mairie, on leur a demandé un terrain d'foot
Ils ont refusé, on s'est mis à bicrave et on a ouvert un terrain d'chnouf
Bouffe pas la galette des rois, tu trouveras pas la fève
J'ai vendu la galette darwa, j'ai fini au Quai des Orfèvres

Laissez passer les têtes de cabochards
Enfouraillés au 79, rue Quentin Bauchart
Donne toujours une pièce quand tu rencontres un clochard
Wesh, éteins ton char
Échange pas des années d'liberté contre un bon-char
En bon couche-tard, j'ai la gueule du Capitaine Caverne
Va niquer ta mère
Si t'es un kouffar
On a la même beu-bar qu'Jacques-Oussama Mess'Laden
Au tier-quar on baise la mère de Papy Broussard

Seth Gueko,"2Pac attend que je meurs pour pouvoir faire un duo
Ma femme m'a offert un flingue, je lui offert un plumeau
Mon rap réchauffe les clodos et glace le sang des bobos
Tu rappes la street avec les doigts croisés dans le dos mytho
Nous on tire des traîneaux de blèmes-pro
Cette année je veux pas de cadeaux
Je veux juste une échelle assez grande pour tchek mes proches qui sont partis là-haut
Ouais décroche quand je t'appelle
Pti't narvalo de javel
Si t'es en enfer avant moi, prépare le Nespresso
J'ai de l'or entre les jambes et du plomb dans la cervelle
Écoute pas les petites putes qui veulent rapper comme Gueko
En léchant Julia Channel, t'as un peu sucer Rocco blaireau
Je suis la goutte d'eau qui fait déborder le string
Le couteau qui égorge les porcs, les skins
Maragwé, je me suis tatoué Seth Guex sur les mains
Je te rentre mon blaze dans le crâne à coups de poings, mon copain

Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec
Je veux mourir en paix comme ceux qu'on bu l'eau de la Mecque
Tu te fais des lignes de blanche avec ta carte black
T'as la main sur le cœur seulement pendant les crises cardiaques
Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec
Je veux mourir en paix comme ceux qu'on bu l'eau de la Mecque
Ils ont tous le barreau sur mon avocate
Tu te sens moins seul en cellule avec le Iphone 4

Y a que les perles rares qui nous rendent visite au parloir
C'est pour ça que je préfère les huîtres au caviar
Sorti du placard en limousine, désosse le corbillard
Et sabre le millésime
Les jeunes veulent rejoindre le crime organisé
Pas de piste pour l'ennemi juste un coup de chaussure ferré
En sape ou en rimes, le niveau est élevé
Le plan a carrément échouer
Avocat libre,on garde notre part d'ombre tout comme Karim Achoui
Frère, j'ai un plan en or
Je sors avec une bijoutière
Les flics froids, on les accueille avec un frigidaire
Si t'es mon frère, prouve le moi comme Cyril Khider
Mettez moi au quartier disciplinaire
C'est mort, je reste muet comme un cimetière

Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec

Trop jaloux pour qu'elle voie un gynécologue homme
Pti't narvalo de Cologne
Si je veux t'effacer de ma vie, mon gun est ma gomme
Je fais mon trou lentement mais surement comme les Gog et Magog

Comme dit Axiom, mon argent a été blanchi
La coke et les amphét' circule dans les amphi'
On s'enfuit de-spee comme Valentino Rossi
Ligoter ce monsieur qu'ont violenté nos reu-soeu

On se ref'ra pas à 40 ans donc faut pas se louper
Si je fais des doigts sur les photos, y aura Fifou pour flouter
T'as un pipo entre les amygdales, tu penses qu'à flûter
Moi j'ai le cigare d'Hannibal et la tchatche a Futé

En tant que surveillant, les flics ratés postulent
Pas besoin de tank, on fait la guerre en costume
Les filles traquent les thunes et un joli mec

Je suis bien au tiek's quand y a de la plaquette sur la planche
Question sexe, je te fais minette si tu me fais une blanche
La poisse me colle au dersh comme un pet foireux
Tête de buse, si tu touches mon guigui, nettoie le
Ouais mon flingue j'fais mumuse avec devant la glace
OK, je fais la bouche vers le bas comme celle d'Al Pac'
D'ailleurs j'ai la même grain de caf', la même chemise à fleurs
Sauf que moi j'ai pas mon pote qui sodomise ma sœur
Nique le poste de Cergy, la pute de l'accueil
Mets des chaussettes à la menthe si tes shoes puent de la gueule
Car en garde à v', fini l'orgueil
Les Air Max servent d'oreiller pendant qu'on rêve au Sultan de Bruneï

Et une putain de question me taraude
Pourquoi elles m'appellent toutes Tirak
Aller casse oit, prends le ton billet de 1000 Baths
Bad cowboy, bad pirate
Mes putes tu peux les compter sur les doigts d'un 1000 pattes
Même les culs de jattes, ils baisent à Phuket
Demande à Larry Flynt, ça marche comme sur des roulettes
Je porte mes couilles avec une brouette
Je chie la porte ouverte
Je descends pour acheter une baguette
Je reviens en remontant ma braguette
Je crois que je vais mourir au volant de ma canette
Gremlins sur le pec, sur mes phalanges Seth
Je me crois tout permis comme un Farang-set
Y me manque juste un one to call pour appeler la daronne
Je suis marqué par la vie comme Nui Dragon

Je suis dans le rap comme un pyromane au bal des pompiers
Sur les 10 yeux de mes frères et sœurs
T'es pris en chasse, bombarde comme un coursier qui transporte une greffe de cœur
Quand je rentre pas, ma mère crève de peur
Je lui demande pardon avec une gerbe de fleurs
Ou une rafale de bisous
Comme ça je peux coffrer des truc chez elle, trankilou bilou
Comme on sait pertinemment qu'on léchera jamais le minou de Rihanna, mon petit loup
Si on la croise, on lui arrache son sac Jimmy Choo
J'suis ni ton petit chou à la crème, ni ton soce
A toutes les sauces
Si y a ton A.D.N à la crime, c'est aud-ch
Aud-ch quand t'as perdu ton tél'
Avec tes numéros de meuf, tes numéros de boloss
Imagine oi-m mettre des coups de pelle comme Albert Dupontel
Sur une plage nudiste de Mykonos

Si t'as tapé dans le stock gros, materfuck
Montre nous ce que t'as dans le froc ou materfuck
Materfuck ça veut pas dire que ta mère c'est un phoque
Mais qu'on baise ta mère si t'es une poucave ou un proc'
Donc materfuck, si t'as serrait la sœur d'un pote, materfuck
Tu me dois des sous, t'ouvres pas la porte, je te materfuck

Après la zic, je fais du X à l'inverse de Catherine Ringer
On me remarque comme l'odeur d'un grec dans le bus
La quête du khalis est une course pleine d'embûches
Je veux plus d'anniv' sans bougies
Ni noël sans bûches, finish
Préviens tes gamins pendant les perquis', ces fils de putes
Iront jusqu'à éventrer le traversin et l'ours en peluche
50% Russe, 50% Sicilien
Si je vais en Californie, c'est à califourchon sur le dos d'un missile syrien
Texte criminel, le calibre roulé dans le torchon
Dans une chaussette noire, comme... comme Eddy Mitchell
J'ai jamais rempli un caddie de Fauchon
Le rap game c'est un ramassis de faux-jetons
Ils font du bruit pour rien comme les pimps ils se traînent
Dis aux gros porcs et aux gabarits de cochons
Qu'il y a plus de trous de balles au F.N que sur 50 Cent
Faut qu'on détourne les lois
Au poste j'ai des trous de mémoires
Je marche qu'avec des tos, des crouilles, des noirs
Des bridés, des blancs qu'on des blèmes-pro familiaux
Ils me reconnaissent dans le métro
Je les dé-dé-dé-dédicace car ils me font passer avec leurs carte Navigo
Faut qu'on se repentisse avant l'Apocalypse Now
Sert moi un Calypso, un Cuba Libré
Amigo, un coupable est libre et calibré
Faut que les feuilles tombent comme en automne sinon c'est monotone
Moi et les flics, on s'entend pas avec ou sans sonotone
Autant de blues que dans la voix des artistes signés chez Motown
Dans le treizième c'est Chinatown
Saint-Ouen-l'Aumône c'est plutôt Cartagena
Je te parle pas de la farine Maïzena
La famille, la maille c'est rien, partagez-la
Je veux la vie longue, pas la villa de la famille Rockefella
Ca fait sblah comme la frappe de Mario Balotelli
Y a du gent-ar à se faire dans le 16 avec les gars de l'hôtellerie
Ca les potos l'ont compris
Depuis ils assoient des jéroboams en boîte et s'habillent en Gucci-gui
Je porte le costard comme Fabrice Luchini
Mème quand j'avais sorti zéro bum-al
J'avais déjà la chemise déformée par la crosse en bois du guigui
Comme si c'était norma-gal, blah
Laisse moi défaire ma boucle Zilli
Montrer ce que j'ai dans le slip dans la rue et s'il le faut au Mooncity
Beaucoup d'histoires se règlent après un coup de gueule, un coup de gun ou un coup de zizi
J'ai l'argot d'un taulier de bars à hôtesses

Faire du biff nous monte au veau-cer toutes les secondes

De ceux qui prennent des coups de Soleil à cause de la graisse à traire
Je veux écrire dans la souffrance, rapper dans l'aisance
Autrement dit écrire dans les caves, rapper les pieds dans la merde
Pourri depuis la naissance, je suis comme une pomme qui cache son vers
Si je vois une petite du tieks en boîte, direct j'casse son verre
Puis dit tout à son frère

On a des gueules de travers comme si on était nés près d'une usine nucléaire

J'arrive en fourgon cellulaire, je repars en V.10
La haine sa ronge car quand les peines s'allongent, les parents vieillissent

J'aurai toujours des potes-ca pour chaque années
Le sida fait plus de 10 000 macabés
Tant qu'ils y aura des bavures, y aura des villes saccagés
Y aura toujours une voiture, une cabine ou une vitre à casser
Les petits sont comme des tigres affamés
Y aura toujours du biff à brasser
Y aura toujours des filles mal poilés
Car pour eux même dans le quartier sont petits, basanés

Ton corps se mouille dès que chante la caillera
La vie n'est pas rose comme la chatte d'Anksa Kara
Une rose pour ma femme, un flingue pour son amant
A 20 ans, elles ont déjà un Sex Toy dans le sac à main
Les boules bien accrochées comme sur un sapin
Je vais tout déchirer comme Freddy qui baise dans des draps de satin
La petite catin, elle veut déjà la vie de rêve
Alors que mon sexe la connait ni des dents, ni des lèvres

Je suis sous pression comme un match Maroc-Algérie
Tu t'affoles, hein? Tu sais que t'auras mal chérie
Tu sais que j'ai pris mon p'tit Kamagra Oral Jelly
Rap, délits, j'ai le cul entre 2 chaises électriques
Je rappe la main dans le slip pour mieux jouir de ma réussite

Seth Gueko,"J'veux un putain d'ventilo, mais j'ai pas d'lovés sur mon pécule
Attends j'te récapitule
Ça fait huit jours que j'tourne en rond dans une putain d'cellule
Jamais vu d'aussi près l'bitume
J'souhaite à personne le placard pendant la canicule
Ce putain de soleil, ces putains de grilles aux fenêtres
Sur mon lit j'fais bronzette, j'ressemble à une gaufrette
J'écris des lettres pour le coiffeur, pour la muscul'
La juge sait plus quoi faire pour que j'me sente minuscule
Mais bats les yeuks, on s'fait la causette de fenêtre à fenêtre
T'es pas content, on t'fait ta fête
La recette! deux, trois boîtes de thon dans une chaussette
Bracos, peu-stu, faux chèques: on est tous là pour chose-quelque
Même un chien voudrait pas d'la gamelle qu'on mange
Mon co' veut rouler son pét' et aussi démouler son cake
Donc j'tire le rideau et j'crame une peau d'orange
Gros on est bien loin des chiottes de Prison Break
Un pigeon m'guette, là derrière les barreaux
J'ai des chtars sur l'dos, et ni l'baveux, ni l'dermato' pourront sauver ma peau
""Wesh surveillant! La douche, là! Ça fait une heure que j'ai mis l'drapeau !""
Alors je cogne à la porte comme un rat mort
Qu'on m'colle un rapport, j'm'en bats les noix d'cajou
J'irai au mitard avec le phone à Bazou
Prévenez les majeurs, dites au cas où
¿Qué pasa? J'entends comme des booms de grenades
C'est les colis qui tombent dans la cour de promenade
Narvalo, on s'lave au lavabo comme au camping
J'ai écrit c'texte sur un bon d'cantine

Mercredi 30 Juin 2010, 21 heures 27
ça fait près d'une semaine qui font lère-ga aux arrivants 7
Tu demanderas même quand c'est la merde bah moi je m'en bas les coucougnettes
Il me reste qu'un zdah alors je le roule sans faire tomber aucune boulettes
J'appelle Foued pas au phone-télé, nan par la fenêtre, j'ai eu la fouille ministériel
J'ai du le planquer, dahwa t'inquiète pas
Dans la maine-se je reprends une ce-pu et je me rebranche, nan
Il m'en faut 2 ouais, il me faut une puce Bouygues et une puce Orange
A cette heure ci, je me verrai bien en train de me habat dans un ranch
Woogataga, un petit verre de Vodka, avec un zeste d'orange
J'ai envie de faire du rodéo, une petite lehsa et que des coups de hanches
Mais trop souvent on m'a boycotter, je suis rancunier envers beaucoup de ens-g
Qu'ils aillent se faire enculer, la roue elle fait pas du sur place
On m'a dit, aide toi et le ciel t'aidera, dahwa c'est pour ça que je me surpasse
Je sais pas ce qui ce passe dans ma tête, je sais ce qui ce passe dans ma cité
Les petits, ils ont repris rrain-té donc les grands sont sur-exités
Quand la tension devient trop forte, les plombs ils sont obliger de sauter
Armé de mes cordes vocales, l'instru' j'étais en train de la ligoter
Si t'as pas de parloir soit débrouillard, obliger de traficoter
Quand t'es en plein coeur de la chose faut juste voir le bon côté
Quand on me pose la question, ""wesh You alors comment vont les zamours?""
Je réponds, ""ils vont bien, ils sont sur la 2, le sbah presque tous les jours""
Dites à Zemmour qu'il s'étonne pas que je contienne autant de haine en moi
J'observe que plus les années passent, plus elles se font rares les peines en moi
J'ai envie de faire beaucoup de hébètes, investir dans mon bled
Je kifferai rendre à bel Mohamed ce que jadis était à Mohamed
La charité faut que je l'ordonne bien donc je la commence par moi même
Les faux je leur donne rien si ce n'est un savon quand je suis au hammam
J'ai un fusil, je fais pas de K-1, je suis le genre de mec qui vend de la one
Dahwa moi je viens pas de l'usine crois moi, là-bas profite à oi-m
Bon bah je vais me faire un petit kawa vu que là il est déjà 7 heures du mat'
Ensuite faut que je dorme et Inch'Allah dès que je sors, je pète l'audimat",Zoogatazblex [30 Juin 2010]

Bien sûr que j'aime les femmes j'les baise sur du Mobb Deep One-Twelve, pas d'trêve
Fiston dessine moi un flic mort avec des aquarelles
M'fais pas l'coup d'la migraine

J'arrive en tracteur déposer la p'tite graine

Ga-ga-ga-garde, be-be-be-belle en Massey Ferguson

Chez nous l'amour, c'est un trou avec des poils autour
La mort, un putain d'trou avec de l'herbe autour
Depuis toujours ici c'est alcool, shit, cannabis
Et comme les gitanes m'adorent, j'fume pas d'Gitanes Maïs
Ils ont une punchline par artiste, j'en ai mille par album
J'maîtrise la technique des rimes comme Ferrara maîtrise la technique parabole
Badaboum, quésako, j'dors que d'un œil comme Sylvia Jeanjacquot
Narvaline, t'es belle comme une fleur, j'te paierais un pot

Riche ou pauvre on finira tous dans une tombe sous l'herbe
Tu m'as vu en Rolls Phantom, appelle les Ghostbusters

Laisse moi Julie d'Secret Story juste une p'tite heure
Elle va ffé-ki comme Dutroux au concert d'Justin Bieber
Ouais file moi l'number d'ton berry-Black

Je m'en fous,
L'important c'est que t'appelles Maître Bouzrou si je suis au trou
Mais qu'est-ce tu fous? Dans le peu-slaï, un bouleau
Des punchlines j'en à la louche, crillave les os de tes moulos
Sache qu'on dit pas ""my man"" aux 'nouches
On traque les demoiselles au culot, tise le Damoiseau au goulot
J'ai oublié mon phone-tel au Sofitel, narvalo
Quand j'appelle c'est pas Nafissatou mais Strauss-Kahn qui dit ""Allô?""
Fratello, j'me sens boycotté, c'est réel
Faut-il sauver le Soldat Ryan ou tuer le Colonel Reyel?

Je veux un peu plus d'oseille, sur la chatte à Mireille

Chaque rime c'est du lourd comme le cul de Bouddha
Appelle-moi ""Dodo la Saumure""
Je vais te casser la bouche sans la toucher
Juste en dessinant une bite là sur le mur
Je suis la violence à l'état pur, en chair et en saucisse
Je vais pas te briser le cœur t'en as qu'un chérie,
Je vais te briser un os, t'en as 206
Nique le swag, nique le buzz, nique la Police
Laisse pas Charles Trénet ton fils
T'as des rimes de grossiste, des clips de RMIste
Tu sais même plus dans quelle chiotte pisser comme un transformiste
Les keufs me veulent dans leurs putain de filet à fiches de recherche
T'es pas muslim en mangeant un Filet-O-Fish
Wesh, tout les dimanches, je vais à la Jacques Mess'
Je te mets la bite dans l'œil comme dans Serbian Movie, tasse-pèch
Trop de punchline dans le texte pour faire un flow accélération
Y a un MC sur le piéton? Vroum, j’accélère à fond
Encore une ramification de bagnard
Cicatrices, scarifications de bagarres
Fausse be-bar, falsification de papelards
Nique la RATP, leur tarification de bâtard
C'est pas un mur Facebook qu'il te faut, c'est un trottoir
On roule comme des chauffards, carbonisation de radar
Bâtard, c'est le Parc des Princes ou le Stade Vélodrome
Des têtes vont tomber, Néochrome c'est Game of Thrones
On est là mister, t'es pas d'accord?
Nique ta sœur comme un Lannister, 'llah yster
Nique l'institut Pasteur, ma rage n'a pas de vaccin
Je suis tellement loin que bientôt je vais rapper en martien
Les MC's tournent en rond
Si ils allaient à la vitesse de la lumière
Ils pourraient s'auto-enculer, les bouffons
Envoie le son, les rimes sont pachydermiques
J'écoute le rap français, c'est archi-merdique
Les flics arrêtent mes types pour leurs graphiques,
C'est de l'arithmétique
J'allais jamais en cours, j'ai pas pu baffer l'instit'
Prépare ton speech si tu vas chez la SPIP
T-MAX, Air Max, c'est la street, grosses liasses avec élastique
Et ça baraude même sur Walking Street
Pas de sentiments que des centilitres
Liasse de baths dans le slip, on fait la tournée des bars
Une fois que j'ai pris une cuite, je raconte tout mes déboires
Viens pas nous faire croire que t'es venu en Thaï pour Chok Muay
Joue pas l'Chuck Norris, plus rien me choque Morray
Capitale du vice, Los Patayos
J'ai le ventre à Carlos, les jambes de Damien Alamos
Salam alaykoum si tu vas à la quée-mos
Pendant que les boloss fument le Ice à la Kate Moss
Ouais c'est atroce si t'as un trans' comme parent
Dis pas le mot ""sperme"" devant une Thaï, c'est un mot transparent
Le porno c'est ma porte d'échappement
Tu baises pas un gamos en mettant ta bite dans un pot d'échappement
Trop hardcore pour être charmant ou pour être aimé
Le Husky c'est un chien de traîneau, le Chihuahua c'est un chien de trainée
Je rappe pour les têtes grainées et les têtes rasées ma gueule
Un trou c'est un trou, une bastos elle a pas d'œil
Bang! Vos clash me chatouillent comme une mouche du bled
Allez, je vous embrasse tous avec la petite bouche du zguègue
Arrête de bander avec les couilles des autres
Ton rap m'en touche une sans faire bouger l'autre
En crachant sur l'un, forcément tu suces l'autre
La salope de l'un est souvent la femme d'un autre
Petit je voulais être voleur pas astronaute
Ce que j'avais pas, j'allais le péta chez les autres
Je suis ni dans un camp, ni dans l'autre

My friend, j’suis au cœur d’une prison sexuelle
Il m’faut un mandat toutes les 2 semaines
Il m’faut un Western ""lew lew"", il m’faut un virement
Avant d’être en chien comme un birman
Quelle question! Evidemment on veut tous rester!
Mais va falloir qu’on paye les overstay
J’suis avec ma sale équipe, dans l’fond du carré VIP
Attiré par l’Hollywood comme par une force magnétique
Une force maléfique
J’ai d’quoi leur faire Songkran avec du champagne, mais pas d’quoi payer un Lady Drink

Ca traficote avec les Thaï, sous une paillotte
Ma pouffe dort comme une marmotte, à l’hôtel Mariott
Direction l’île Mayotte

Je t’envoie tout dans les cheveux, comme du Vivelle Dop
Big up aux petits roufs, mes petits reufs qui te rendent ouf
Je suis bien dans mon tieks, dans une chatte, ou dans mes pantoufles
Le vent souffle, pour moi les MCs sont morts de trouille
Je connais un bled où tu baises contre un bol de nouilles
Défilé de punchlines, c’est de la haute coupure,
Mange pas la gamelle, dedans, ils mettent du bromure
Étincelant, comme un sourire avec 2 dents en or pur
Je rappe le dos au mur, ouais, petit joueur
Je vise le top of the world,
On fait des fausses fiches de paye, avec Windows Word
On met pas de baggy, on nique Eisenhower
T’es belle comme une fleur, je te fais une Golden Shower

On roule sur toi comme sur un ralentisseur
Je veux baiser maintenant, pas dans 10 heures
Achète l’album, l’écoute pas sur Deezer,
Ou on roule sur toi comme sur un ralentisseur
Tu suces mal comme un téléchargeur
A mon signal, videz les chargeurs
On roule sur toi comme sur un ralentisseur
Je veux baiser maintenant, pas dans 10 heures

Trois-quarts des gens n'ont pas vraiment d'amour, ils calculent
Les grandes salopes traînent toujours avec les petites crapules
Quand je vois les commentaires sur le net, je rêve de dictature
Vous serez tous foutus dès que j'aurai mes cinq cents signatures
C'est pour mes adultes immatures, mes types qui mènent une vie de raclure
Mes smicards qui taffent dur, mes jeunes dépressifs qui saturent
Cinq heures du mat', plus de mélange, on finit le sky pur

Papa veut s'barrer au bled
Maman veut voir l'bébé sortir d'la schneck

C’est o-ciel-ffi, le rap français porte un string celle-fi
Alors laissez-moi m’affaler sur mon chesterfield
Garçon, j’allais au charbon quand t’allais smurfer
Les keufs s'prennent trop pour Alex Murphy
Allons rafaler les fous qui baisent leurs filles
Les pédophiles faut faire morfler
Yeah, grosse caisse, gros dérapage
Grosse rafale sur videur, car gros recalage
Entre toi et moi, trop de décalage
Les têtes vont tomber, orh, élagage
Zgeg méga-long, méga-large
Méga-flow, méga-phases
J’baise mes ex en guise de dépannage
Gros pied d’biche pour les portes du paradise",Gros dérapage

Seth Lakeman,"Out of the moonlight in the month of May, 
This ship would take her last breath. 
Her full mast it was draping, 
Like a mermaid she was dressed. 

Her lonely heart is setting free, 
As all her cares they went sailing out to sea. 

And all those people they gathered round, 
And flocked to view that lovely sight. 
And all young maidens they came to town, 
They waved her out on through the night.

Her lonely heart is setting free, 
As all her cares they went sailing out to sea. 

She tried to clear the rocks with swelling 
Sails, 
The ocean beat her everytime, 
And with a crack her body failed. 
But the sea engulfed and filled her eyes. 

Her lonely heart is setting free, 
As all her cares they went sailing out to sea. 
I can hear her calling,I can hear her calling,
I can hear her calling back to me.

And when the news returned to the town, 
Well every maid sat on the pier, 
If lovers lost and fathers never found, 
For now that mermaid's dressed in tears. 

Her lonely heart is setting free,
As all our prayers they went sailing out to 
Sea. 
I can hear her calling,I can hear her calling,
I can hear her calling back to me,

Now that mermaid's dressed in tears,
I feel that mermaid's dressed in tears,
I see that mermaid's dressed in her tears.",Lady of the Sea (Hear Her Calling)
Seth Lakeman,"The day comes in, the girl walks out, 
Summer sings and Winter shouts. 
Seasons breaking over me, 
All I do is sit and dream. 

Before my face her picture hangs, 
A brighter image of this land. 
Step it up or speed me through, 
Come along and take me with you. 

April in your eyes 
I search through the sunshine, 
For April is your time, 
As the world passes by. 

Go out to meet, but stay within, 
I can see that beauty begin. 
The view is free, so much to see, 
The best of summers waiting with me. ",April Eyes
Seth Lakeman,"Breathing sunshine from the flowers, 
A little wisdom from the leaves, 
Carry comfort to the sad tree, 
How the grass it did grieve, 

There's a moment we remember, 
Its a feeling we face, 
Take me down to that world of wonder, 
Into the Garden of Grace 

There's a tree of temptation, 
From the seed of despair, 
We know all our attentions, 
Are for the bodies we bare, 

Chorus 

It's a jungle to the gentle, 
It's a bed for the dead, 
It's a field full of reasons why 
All the soldiers have bled. 

Chorus 

A golden shaft full of sunlight 
Recaptures my face, 
And that angel up from heaven high, 
Gave that Garden its' place 

Go heaven hold me.......
",Garden of Grace
Seth Lakeman,"How much a tale you know is never told, 
How much of youth is growing old, 
How much a thought it will make you think, 
How much you made me get another drink. 

How much you lose you never spend it, 
How much you buy you never lend it, 
How much you risk you never help this, 
And you're straight back on me for another kiss. 

Mean, green eyes they never go, 
Mean, green eyes, but they said so. 
Mean, green eyes they never go, 
There's nothing to reveal. 

How much a fool he wises up, 
How much you talk you can't give it up. 
How much a thought it will make you think, 
How much you made me get another drink. 

Chorus ",How Much
Seth Lakeman,"Show me a great place, 
And pick me that sweet taste, 
I've been so bitter and blinded, 
But done the best they say. 
And love will find my way. 

Lay me on old ground, 
Play me that soft sound, 
I fall from a tall tune, 
Into the best they say. 
Love will find my way. 

The image of love, it'll dig you out, 
And tunnel above to the heart-filled house. 
So tear down those walls and reach the day. 
The Image of love will lead the way. 

Show me your leisure, 
With a chest full of treasures. 
We'll go searching together 
Until we find our day. 
Love will find our way. 
Lyrics Directory > Seth Lakeman > The Image Of Love ",Image of Love
Seth Lakeman,"A maiden might be pure in grace and harmony, 
Problems arise, she'll be there to sacrifice 
And set the mind, as all our cares sail out to sea, 
Into the unknown, a favoured face you stand alone. 

May the colour of your dreams be good as gold, 
Painting pictures 'til that wish unfolds. 

It's all your world.... 
A maiden might be full of grace and harmony, 
When problems arise she should be there to sympathize. 
Set the mind free as all these cares sail out to sea, 
You're more than that friend, a coast to coast, an end to end. 

Chorus ",It's All Your World
Seth Lakeman,"You, you should be sipped not drunk, 
You should be sailed not sunk. 
Take a look outside your window, 
A little look outside your window. 

You, are you a friend or foe, 
Are you the man I know? 
Get a look outside your window, 
Another look outside your window. 

I'll be seeking sunshine after rain, 
I'll be keeping comfort over pain, 
I'll be feeling freedom has that view to carry on, 
Do you want some? 

Go, look outside your window. 

You, are you all wet and wild, 
Have you a certain style? 
Take a look outside your window, 
A little look outside your window. 

You, you should be picked not punched, 
You should be sailed not sunk. 
Take a look outside your window, 
Another look outside your window.

Give ear to my song. 
Ill sing in good praise 
Of all brandy and rum.

With England's control, 
Give me that punch ladel, 
I'll fathom the bowl.

As I sit at my ease. 
She scolds and she grumbles, 
And does as she please. 
Well, she may scold and grumble 
'Til she's black as coal.

I'll fathom the bowl. 

My father he lies 
In the depths of the sea.

Go dream, go send yourself away,

Seth Lakeman,"It was Monday morning in heavy rain, 
When Josie went from our house, never back again, 
Out beyond the hillside where the cattle stand, 
With her recent lover holding her right hand. 

They both went out together in the Monday mist, 
She never saw it coming, waiting at his wrist, 
He struck her swiftly and she fell right down, 
Flowers grew around her a body never found. 

Whenever you`re walking out in the snow, 
Think of poor Josie all on her own, 
Wherever those flowers stand out unknown, 
Youll be steppin` on her gravestone. 

So tell me where is Josie and where`s she flown, 
You both went out together you`ve come back alone, 
You sit so sadly with a face so cold, 
You`re no more paler though than the life you stole.

Down that tunnel and shaft 
Working out my season.

By twenty my hearing, 
Oh had suffered those days, 
Blood upon the copper, 
Oh how I fade away. 

Working in the darkness day by day, 
With nothin` but the dreams to light my way. 

Nothin` but a short life,

Oh no money to save,

There lies a knight slain under his shield, 
His hounds they lie down at his feet, 
So well they can their master keep.

If he see that angel with her love 
The bold knight above, 
If he could see that angel with her love.

as great with young for all the world. 
She lifted up his bloody head, 
and kissed his wounds that were so red.

My heart still beats for thee, 
These empty arms still for your fair rest

Seth Lakeman,"I'll sing you a song how first we began
Our toils and our troubles our plot and our plan
We left our fair country, and all our friends and our homes
Across to the deserts wild and the mountains to roll

We traveled three weeks 'til we came to the platt
Set up our camp ahead of the pack
In just a moment low we heard a faint yell
Five hundred cavalry they were riding from hell

[Chorus:]
We fight for favor
We will fight for pride
And oh we will fight for favor
We will fight 'til they die

They made a bold dash came near to our train
Bullets fell around like showers of rain
With long rifles at hand we fed them hot lead
'Til many a brave warrior fell down, and around us lay dead

[Chorus]

We travel by day but guard in the night
Across all those mountains so high in their might
Now in a green valley we live beside a clear old stream
Our journey now ended, thank god, in the land of our dreams

We fight for favor
We will fight for pride
And oh we will fight for favor
We will fight for our lives",Fight for Favour
Seth Lakeman,"Worthy of a friendship lying underneath a stone, 
He was a proper master, all of a ship his own. 
For houses and great land many gold in store, 
I know he`d spent the whole lot and would again I`m sure. 

The blackbirds are singing, 
At the breaking of the day, 
When poor old Henry Clark, 
Left and went away. 

For twenty years he scarcly slept upon a proper bed. 
Sleepin` with that faint heart inside a weary head, 
In the weeks he`d gaze out over Plymouth bay, 
To show off all those great girls when the boys are back one day.

Carried to a workhouse all against his will,

He was a great master, so very kind 
But his fair mistress had evil in her mind
He was condemned to die

[Chorus:]
Willingly I took his place 
With my fair love 
Willingly I stole his face 
And soaked it in blood
It was the mistress and the murder for love 

This fair mistress found him asleep 
It's time to kill him then my heart you can keep
He was condemned to die 

Three times I struck him over his head 
It was my first murder, a blood soaken bed
He was condemned to die

Into my room then I did return 
The crime committed, my conscience it did burn
I was condemned to die

Seth Lakeman,"Make us ready boys all with wonder born, 
We`ll guide this fair ship and sail towards the morn, 
Come on all alas, now here`s the master dear, 
I fear this deadly storm is coming to us near. 

We sailed from Plymouth Sound in a week or three, 
with not that far to go boys, some canons to retrieve. 
The night it grew much darker and the wind it came in strong, 
And it grew upon us lads and there was nothing to be done. 

The waves grew higher and broke upon our ship, 
Then poor old master`s taken with nothing left to grip, 
Drop the anchor downwards and throw him out a line, 
Poor old master`s overboard he be swalled by the tide. 

So hear my warning that I give to you, 
Be careful when your sailing with that lucky few, 
Tie up every deck hand tightly `til the morn, 
And well go together boys in the belly of the storm. 
Don`t go sailing out with me, I fear your soul be lost at sea..",The Storm
Seth Lakeman,"The streams of lovely Nancy are divided in three parts, 
Where young men and maidens meet their long sweethearts, 
It is drinking of good liquor that has caused my heart to sing, 
And the noise in yonder village made the rocks ring. 

At the bottom of this mountain runs a river clear, 
A ship from the Indes did once anchor here, 
With her red flags a`flying and the beating of her drum, 
With sweet instruments of music and the firing of her gun. 

At the bottom of this mountain where the birds do fly, 
There is one amoungst them that flies so very high, 
If I had her in my arms near the diamond`s cold black land, 
How soon I`d secure her by the kindness of my hands. 

So come all you little streamers that walk the meadows gay, 
Go write unto your love wherever she may lay, 
With her rosy lips entice me and her tongue she tells me no 
But the angels might direct us wherever we should go.",The Streamers
Seth Lakeman,"Out of the moonlight in the month of May,
This ship would take her last breath.
Her full mast it was draping,
Like a mermaid she was dressed.

Her lonely heart is setting free,
All her cares they went sailing out to sea.

All those people gathered round,
Flocked to view that lovely sight.
All young maidens came to town,
They waved her out into the night.

She tried to clear the rocks with swelling 
sails,
The ocean beat her everytime,
And with a crack her body failed.
Sea engulfed and filled our eyes.

When the news returned to the town,
Every maid sat on the pier,
With lovers lost and fathers never found,
For now that mermaid`s dressed in tears.

Her lonely heart has set us free,
As all our prayers they went sailing out to 
sea.
You can hear her calling,
Now that mermaid`s dressed in tears

Seth Lakeman,"Winter morning, I rode out to take the air. 
I heard them calling, there`s a hunt today 
declared. 

Two young soldiers are on the run, 
Came in courting a maiden young. 
They stole her beauty, took no gold. 
Take no prisoners, take no rogues. 

Judge and jury, forty huntsmen rode to 
town. 
Their noble duty, track those footprints 
up and down. 

Two young soldiers are on the run, 
Came in courting a maiden young. 
They stole her beauty, took no gold. 
Take no prisoners, take no rogues. 

We took that mountain, the moonlight 
shadows cast our way. 
Wind was howling, we must catch our 
bird of prey, 

Two young soldiers are on the run, 
Came in courting a maiden young. 
They stole her beauty, took no gold. 
Take no prisoners, take no rogues. 

Make us ready, I see a fire up ahead, 
Go in gently, load those rifles up with 
lead.

Seth Lakeman,"I heard her in the valley, 
I heard her in the dead of night
The warning of a white hare 
Her eyes burning bright.

Careful you don't catch her 
Or give her right of way. 
For she will look upon you
Steal your soul away

For the white hare is calling
She's dancing in the night 
And she'll be out 'til the morning light

Out upon the heather 
A shadow came onto me 
Her hair was hanging over 
Her face I could not see

She ran behind the rocks
I heard the hounds cry 
The image of a woman 
Her head she held up high

For the white hare is calling
She's dancing in the night
She'll be out 'til the morning 
With her eyes burning bright 
The white hare is calling you

If you go hunting 
Or calling out your prey 
Or if you see a fair maid
With hair an ashen grey

Careful you don't catch her 
Or give her right of way 
For she will look upon you
Steal your soul away

For the white hare is calling
She's dancing in the night 
She'll be out 'til the morning

For twenty five days no more. 
Now mark that spot from whence I came 
It's for king and country I`ll come back

Two weeks gone and still no autumn 
tune.

The dimming days they serve no better

Seth Lakeman,"We left our sweethearts
And our wives along that pier
""Cheer up"", they said
""You'll soon return in half a year""

So we sailed up north to reach the ice
We took full sails
Each boat was manned with guns
And rope to hunt that whale

We know, that we're fighting
In this frost on our own
And we'll see no sound
Or sight of our homes

And our lovers will be
Waiting there till spring
It's a ramble and a race to be king
Race to be king

Now we've been sailing a league or three
Till we glimpsed that shore
The night was dark and won no hearts
So we stayed on board

There fired a shot along our deck
And down one side
And it cracked our mast and swept in fast

Seth Lakeman,"At fair Mount's Bay, on that Christmas week
Was such a raging storm, no man could speak 
That lifeboat thundered through an angry sea 
Was called Solomon Browne and her company 

With courage, it was called
On our heroes brave and bold
With courage, it was cold
On board that night 

Now the stricken coaster called the Union Star 
Her maiden voyage, she never thought that far
With Captain Moreton and his four man crew 
A woman to save and her daughters two 

Now, never had a lifeboat fought in vain 
She could have made a dash for port but she tried again 
All sixteen perished in that mighty wave 
It tossed them overboard into a watery grave 

With courage, it was called 
On our heroes brave and bold 
With courage, it was cold 
On board that night 

Now back at Penlee Point, time stood still 
Twelve young children cried for their fathers killed 
A nation shed tears for years as the news went round 
The constant courage of our Solomon Browne. 

With courage, it was called 
On our heroes brave and bold 
With courage, it was cold 
On board that night 

With courage, it was called

Seth MacFarlane,"When you get all set 
To go into your big love scene
The night must be right
The mood be slow
The wine must be high
And the lights must be low

And I recommend some music in the background
For when you're fumbling for the right words to say
You'll find that music will go a long way

Music is better than words
You break the spell when you start to speak
That technique is all wrong
Just forget about words and sing her a song

Music was made for romance
Love and a sweet song go hand in glove 
Every lover knows this
And the sweeter the song, the sweeter the kiss

When you're without love you cry
And your song is the blues
But when you've got love you're high
And your song is a gay refrain
A happy strain that sings out the news
Don't let the night go to waste
Looking for ways to say 'I love you'
Take your cue from the birds

Let it snow! let it snow! let it snow!

And I've bought some corn for popping 
The lights are turned way down low 
Let it snow! let it snow! let it snow! 

When we finally kiss goodnight 
How I'll hate going out in the storm! 
But if you'll really hold me tight 
All the way home I'll be warm

When the snow comes to cover the ground,
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day,

Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly,
In the arms of the evergreen trees,
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,
It's shining so your nose won't freeze.

The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,
The world is your snowball just for a song,
Get out and roll it along.

It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
Take a walk with your favorite girl,
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late,
In winter, it's a marshmallow world.

Seth Sentry,"Yo, it goes science
Yeah science is amazing
But not to me though cause I am sick of waiting
I've been patient
I really have, I've been reasonable
Now it's time to say what I needed to
Dear science, cheers for the iPods
White goods, yeah thank you for the cyborgs
Top work on the light bulb
That was quite cool
But where's my hoverboard?
I mean I know you've been busy
But no hoverboards just seems a bit piss weak
I got a brand new computer and a big screen
I guess Back to the Future was a dick tease
And I can't be the only one
Maybe everyone forgot but I am holding on
The hovercraft was a solid start
Shoulda stuck with it, hoverboard
Where the fuck is it?

I just wanna let you know you let me down
I just wanna let you know you let me down
When I was just a kid at a tender age
I was thinking about tomorrow and them better days
I just wanna let you know you let me down

It goes, robots doing jobs that we don't want
Botox women looking more like robots
It's so odd, everybody's getting nose jobs
Looking more like aliens with our clothes off
Hold up, I just had a new thought
What if UFOs are just us from the future coming back in time to sight see?
Or might be to snatch women?
Tell 'em to bring some hoverboards back with 'em
When I was a kid I nearly threw a fit
I got a skateboard, (shit) I was furious
Like.. what's the deal?
What the hell am I supposed to do with this
It's got wheels, yeah I can't gleam the cube with this
Man, science'll sort it out hopefully
I don't wanna roll around the ground like a nobody
I wanna soar upon a board made of pure science
I am still saving up my dollars for a hoverboard

You can take a jet pack when the jets packed
A rocket with a chest strap seems like a death trap
So forget that, just gimme the damn hoverboard
And I won't have to do another monologue
The other day I drew a little rough design on a serviette
So now all you have to do is make it work and shit
Just get some magnets and a piece of wood and glue 'em on
But I'm not trying to tell you people how to do your job
Just keep the drawings and I'll be back in the morning
To check whether you're dawdling
You're sure to win awards for it
The most awesomest idea since the DeLorean
Be sure to try to make one to travel over water with
And yeah I thought I saw 'em on Beyond 2000
And I'm pretty sure that we're beyond that now man
I know I'm rambling but fucking hell science
I just want a hoverboard before I'm too old to ride it

I just wanna let you know you let me down
I just wanna let you know you let me down
When I was just a kid at a tender age
I was thinking about tomorrow and them better days
I just wanna let you know you let me down

They bombarded us with long articles about the Hadron Collider
Trying to find the God particle
And everybody's arguing about whether or not to clone people
Or keep it to farm yard animals, shit
Double 'em up, triple 'em
Fuck the discipline
Grab a bunch of rabbits and slap all the lipstick on 'em you want
Yeah, maybe high heels to match
That's what playing God is for

Through the hourglass of lies & deceit

Slow it down, yes if I can't make it

Well it's the miracle, lyrical, words I compose
And it's a hard knock life
But it's the one that we chose
So I paid my dues, I took the time that it takes
Freestyle separates the truths from the fakes
And that's the breaks
It takes time to get your game
25 years I'm finally breaking out the frame
And out the frame so simple and plain
Reminisce the place from where we came
Went through so many phases
That it amazes me so
From single to Double A 
And now we're playing the Pro's
Touring in the van thinking these are the days
Having nationwide dreams,
Tour buses, and getting paid
So we're thinking while we're drinking
About the choices we made
And the road that we paved for,
Love that needs to stay

When will I ever see,
That face looking back at me
We spend our time alone, don't you know
It's getting hard to breathe

And all the memories I look back on
Still accomplish nothing at all
And all the dreams & happiness 
Were shared between a man
And his woman of gold

No longer can I touch your
Face again will I ever be
Able to feel your skin from under

Neath the ground I reach out
I try to pull you in
But over & over again 
I swear I see that face
Looking back at me again",When

It's from your mouth where your true colors pour

From choking on my last breath
Faded with the sunset
Where did you go?
Bleeding
But still this heart is beating
It's not just a feeling
It's taking control

Flash back to the time you was mine
I was so blind
And I couldn't see the sign
How we both one
And our lives intertwined
How we separate 
And now I'm out of my mind

Like a precious stone
Diamond in the cave of your heart
Where it's grown

I just wanna know

Like somebody is holding
And won't let me go

No queen in my throne
Looking at my empire 
All turn to stone
Falling through my fingers
Like a love never known
I was so wrong baby
And I know that
Take the hand of the clock 
Make it roll back
Take the heart out my chest
Hear, hold that
You the only one same place
Where my soul's at

You could be strong

Because you like your happiness
Don't sacrifice it to the average
Keep it for yourself

To clean the racks
Until a kid like you
Can buy them back

(Traditional; arranged by Seven Nations)

Come on Irishmen both young and old
With adventure in your soul
There are better ways to spend your days
Then by working down a hole

I was tall and true all of 6 foot 2
Til they broke me across my back
By a name I'm known that is not my own
For they call me crooked Jack

And I curse the day I went away
To work on those hydro dams
All our sweat and tears our hopes and fears
Bound up with shuttering jams

For I've seen men old before their time
Their faces worn and gray
But I never thought that I myself
Would soon be the self same way

And they say that honest toil is good
For the body and the soul
But I'll tell you boys it's for sweat and blood
That they want you down the hole

Seven Nations,"He can't believe his eyes 
But with much surprise 
Believes
She won't be back today 
I thought I heard her say 
Goodbye
And I believe, in nothing's wrong 
Don't get me wrong 
That's the way it should be
He's floating 'round the day 
Won't come down no way 
No reason 
And I found out today 
That maybe it's okay 
To carry on this way 
If you think it's good for you 
And I believe, in a goodbye 
Where no one will cry 
That's the way it should be",No Reason

Won't you come into the right
There's no need to fight anymore today
All you people
All you people
It seems too strange to me
That when we can talk so clear
We leave so much in doubt
When we can talk so clear
We leave so much in doubt

All you people
While my song is in the air
You're all welcome to share
My smoke, my wine
All you people
All you people

And it seems so strange to me
When we can talk so clear
We leave so much in doubt
When we can talk so clear
We leave so much in doubt
And I still wonder that the fussing
And the fighting and the shouting's all about

So don't wake me because I'm already gone
Don't wake me

Seven Nations,"I hold my hands in front of me to block my line of sight 
It seems my eyes are growing tired of staring in the light 
The more I see, the more I feel, the less I want to know 
Because if you think to much you'll blow your mind 

You might just lose control and scream 
I walk the line ahead of me my eyes fixed to the ground 
I hear a voice that calls to me I don't dare make a sound 
You can see the hate you can taste the anger 
You can hold it in your hands 
I could take a knife and split it open but still I wouldn't understand 

And I scream from the earth 
I scream at the sky 
And I scream for all I'm worth 
I hope you're coming soon 
I hope you're coming soon 

So many people 
Believe in life 
I hope you're coming soon 

Something just occurred to me that I think I knew before 
It comes to me like a creeping shadow 
Like a light from a half closed door 
Do I think too much or not enough 
Do I even have a clue 
Because here I stand a single person 
Is there anything I can do 

And I scream from the earth 
I scream at the sky 
And I scream for all I'm worth 
I hope you're coming soon 
And I scream from the earth 
I scream at the sky

 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see.

 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
 And grace will lead us home.

 Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace
Seven Places,"Jesus Christ our Savior who is the propitiation, the satisfaction if you would, for our sins, and not just for our sins, but for the sins of the whole world. The blood of Jesus Christ flowed from seven places. The first place He bleed from, the blood that poured from His head that day. The blood from the thorns in His skull cleanse you from thoughts, the blood that was on His face He has covered the things that you may not want to face up to because of what you've seen or heard. Know this, the blood fl owed for you. ""Yeah, but Jon, you just don't know I've backed away from the Lord, I've turned my back on him."" Well they took a flagellum and they beat His back and blood flowed from His back, it reduced to hamburger meat that day, His back was beaten so brutally. And if you've turned your back on Him and walked away from Him, know this, the blood, the blood that poured from His back, cleanses you sprinkles you. ""Yeah but Jon, you just don't know what I've done with these hands."" Those hands were pierced, those hands were pinned to the tree, spikes driven through those hands where He bled to cleanse you and cleanse me from the stuff that we've handled that we ought not to have handled, the stuff that we've done that we ought not to have done. Hey, understand, the blood flowed from His hand. ""Yeah but it's stuff that's inside of me Jon, It's just things that I feel in my gut, I have bitterness towards them, and I'm angry with her."" Jesus wants you to know that blood flowed from His side when they thrust th at spear into Him when He hung on the cross. ""Feet that walked where I ought not to have walked."" Blood flowed from His feet too, when the spike pinned Him through the feet, to the cross of calvary. And now I realize things that I can't face up to, thoughts that I've had that are not right, not good, not true, bitterness inside of me, stuff I've touched that I ought not to touch, places I've gone where I ought not to have walked. And I look and I realize the seven-fold flowing of the blood of Christ clean ses me in every area from all sin and I'm free, and I'm forgiven, by the blood.

Sends me chills now

I'm lonely scared to be lonely

My fears were safe within now they begin
To be lonely scared of the only
Thing I knew best so I thought I knew everything
Until now I see I'm lost and lonely
Shatters everything in my head consumes me
Blinded by one thing obsessed with the need to be loved
Screams become whispers instead assuming
I know I'm losing all the things closest to me
I'm lonely scared to be lonely
Thought until death meant
My fears were safe within
Now they begin to be lonely
Scared of the only thing I knew best
So I thought I knew everything
Until now I see I'm lost and lonely
Angels swirl around me
So now I know I'm not alone
Only scared to be lonely

My fears were safe within now they begin
To be lonely scared of the only

How anybody feels.
Is it really 'cause I feel
I'm the one thats owed it.
Am I wrong? Am I wrong?

Still I feel the blame.
I was shifting my self,
Removing all the punishment
For never being wrong.
I feel life is too long.

For the sorrow I'm to blame.

I could find a better way.

I'm stuck on this road and life just keeps passing me by
What can I do to get from beyond these walls that are laughing at me?
Sentenced to life and the prison is in my mind.

Losing my mind and pushed to the acts,
Someone stop me from running away.
Losing my mind and pushed to the acts,
Someone stop me from running away.

Followed my feet to nowhere again, think that I'm going insane.
Searching for peace by the outcome is always the same.
I wanna believe that I'm here for something
More than just taking up space.
Running away cause I just can't deal with this pain...

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside 
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died 
A sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Sex Mob,"I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine

She said how'd you like to waste some time 
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Ahh!
Nikki!
Oh

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

J'me fais chier comme un gosse dans une galerie d'art
Et j'ai l'impression qu'on me l'a mise comme un afro-cainri d'Harlem
Je mettrais bien la boulette comme devant un feu orange
Je gagnerais bien quelques sous histoire de faire plaiz' un peu aux rent-p's
Des fois, j'aimerais être quelqu'un d'autre
J'aimerais être un pieux qui se contente d'eau et quelques dattes (Je te jure)
Ma vie m'fait peur, j'sais ce qu'il y a après la mort
J'veux pas m'faire défoncer comme les cain-ris à Pearl Harbor
Ici c'est pas les chats qui te-mon sur les gouttières
Mais les petits cambrioleurs, j'les entends rire d'leur coup d'hier
Je les ai même vus ser-po dans le Noctant
Petite bouteille en plastique mais crois même pas que c'est de l'eau dedans
Et ça c'est rien, y'a bien pire chez les filles du seize
Certaines ont plus de conquêtes que les femmes qui vivent du sexe
Il se passe trop de choses, heureusement je sais pas tout
Mais je serais pas dans la merde si le Diable n'avait pas chié partout

J'ai peur que mes actions soient celles des gens de l'enfer
La clef du paradis se trouve pas dans un sac Lancel
Lointaine est l'époque où les homos se maquaient en scred'
Maintenant se galochent en ville avec des sappes arc-en-ciel
Mais vas-y, bouge (Vas-y bouge), toutes ces pratiques ne sont pas saines
Nos corps seront qu'un tas de cendres, la mort sera qu'un passerelle
Ma mémoire s'est fait plomber par une armée de gros bédos
Sans son stard-co, Sarko ressemble à un camé de Soweto
J'ai la dalle d'un Haïtien qui cherche à se barrer de son ghetto
Mais trouve aucune issue à part qu'il a raison d'être pauvre
Car ceux qui se trouvent dans des palaces remercient peu, ne rendent pas grâce
À leur Seigneur, sont des sales races, ils font tout pour que les liasses s'amassent
Changer le monde est impossible comme taper le foot les os rompus
Je désespère encore plus quand je vois que les frères sont corrompus
Les tentations sont nocives mais on fait semblant de pas le savoir

A mon avis, je serai pas trop regretté quand je m'en irai
Tout comme les violeurs à la Guy-Georges ou Fourniret
Poto, ça part en litres, dans le ghetto les parents flippent
Les parrains se tuent pour le titre, moi j'vadrouille sur quelques sites
Hé, ça c'est du lourd, ça ressemble à oim et mon petit reuf
Bientôt, je serai banalisé comme les tournois de la Coupe d'Europe
Renoi, on nous a dit ""Demeurez dans ces taudis
Où la lumière a dormi"", l'obscurité nous a tout dit
Tendu quand on avance pour rentrer, c'est sous défonce
Go quer-ni le voisin d'en face pour éviter les dé-con ou quoi
Je m'ennuie dans ce monde, je me rabats ça fait des semaines
Qu'on en parle, ça fait des oi-ms, viens pas me voir quand je suis dans ce mode

Qu'on est pas con, qu'on est pas contre, la peine

Quoiqu'on vise on échoue, car pour la gloire faut du flouz
Quand un des nôtres monte on l'étouffe à croire qu'les kainfr on est fous
Qu'on veut des cris et des coups, on est grillés du coup
On veut des femmes et de tout, ça donne des camés et des mecs saouls
C'est pour les mecs qui prennent des claques et tombent
Tous les cœurs vides que seuls les quartiers comblent
Toutes ces mains sales, à la rue servent d'éponges
Et sur 10 mecs au bord d'la merde y en a un quart qui plonge
On est séduits par la night, séduits par la maille, c'est dur

Comme un mec qui a vu sa vie défiler lors d'un incendie
Y à 3 ans dans un foyer juste à côté d'place d'Italie
T'étonnes pas si le monde est froid comme le salut d'un invalide
Comme un mec que t'as mis ienb, mais son nouveau pote possède l'avarice

Puis des femmes issues de métissages avec en scène ""Mamasaymamasamamakusa""
Depuis tout p'tit la télé te baise, de Scarface à Télétubbies
L'Etat m'a dit bah t'as cas t'soumettre ou bien faire des jobs à la Katsuni

Trop d’gens regardent ce monde avec un œil de verre
J’enmerde ces cœurs de pierre qui disent et merde y a plus de bière
L’œil de verre se voile la face pour mieux assouvir ses envies
Dissimule la vérité ce qui fait souffrir les gens dignes
Il a des problèmes au cœur qu’un cardiologue peut pas résoudre
Dès qu’il a un petit peu de sous j’le trouve chelou il parait saoûl
Il s’fout d’aller pisser et chier sans gène dans d’l’eau potable
Pendant qu’pour un verre d’eau des miséreux s’mettent des coups d’lame
L’homme vénère l’intelligent en oubliant qu’Hitler l’était
Ne pense plus à l’hiver quand l’soleil éclaire l’été
Ce monde une paire de pompe dans lesquelles j’me sens serré
J’prefère marcher pieds nus car sans elles j’me sens serein
Un homme est digne que dans le Din pas dans le deal ni dans les thunes
Ta cousine joue les coquine aimes-tu entendre que s'en est une
On perçoit notre vie comme un dessin fait dans la nuit
à partir de quelque trait l’œil humain s’fait son avis
Bécoter des decolletés c’est très coté pas boycotté
Boy, j’suis gout-dé, faut m’écouter, y'a à mon goût beaucoup trop d’gays
Une personne qui sourit n’est pas toujours très sage
Le cœur exprime des choses illisibles sur le visage
Comme toute ces filles sales qui mettent des strings ficelle
T’admires ce 50 Cent et tu craches sur une vie saine
Un aveugle qui prie voit mieux qu'ces gens aidés d’un satellite
La connerie des hommes est contagieuse et c’est pour ca qu’j’l’évite
Du mal à croire en l’homme té-ma les dégats d'Nagasaki
Laisse-moi un peu qu’je tire des balles et des balles dans ta patrie, akhi
M’oblige pas à t'parler d’cette fameuse guerre Hutu Tutsi
Où certain butèrent leurs frères juste pour avoir tout tout d’suite
On fait pas d’la médecine avec un scalpel rouillé
Donc construis pas d’mosquée avec des scalapes souillés
Tu zappes ton pote quand il ber-tom donc quand il sort t'es grave géné
Le respect s’est fait tout p’tit et la rue crie écrasez le
J’rigole tellement qu’mes larmes valent cher si j’suis en chien j’pourrais les vendre
Si l’Somalien riait comme moi il pleurerait pour s’bourrer le ventre

L’homme voit sans méditer de l’œil de verre est l’héritier pour son ego est sans pitié
Mais pour donner semble hésiter
L’homme voit sans méditer de l’œil de verre est l’héritier pour son ego est sans pitié
Mais pour donner semble hésiter

Celui dont l’œil est de verre voit mais ne regarde pas
Vers la verité, il ne veut même pas faire un quart de pas
Non, n’incarne pas le rôle de celui qui s’entête
Qui voit les signes mais les rejette car au fond de lui il se sent bête
Les miracles du Très Haut n’lui suffisent pas
Il préfère parler de mère nature decidement il vise bas
Tempêtes et cataclysmes sont les coups d’pression divins
Mais ça ne l’touche pas plus que ça il change de chaine sur son divan
Il voit c’qui s’passe dans l’monde les gosses qui crevent la dalle
Et pourtant, même un ogre ne finirait pas c’qu’il y a sur sa table
Il voit dans quelles conditions certain vivent et s’abritent
Mais n’se soucie de rien tant qu’il a ses livres et sa pipe
Il voit des gens mais n’regarde pas leurs qualités
Il parle comme s’il avait tout vu mais n'a en aucun cas lutté
Il soigne son apparence mais délaisse son intérieur
C’est pour ça qu’pour lui les gens modestes sont inférieurs
Il est froid et dur avec sa femme mais il ne voit pas combien elle l’aime
Elle a toujours été sa fan, de même
Pour sa mère qui pour lui a donne sa ive
Il pense peut-être qu’un coup d’fil ça serait gaspiller d’la salive
Il ne donne peu d’valeur aux gens qui sont proches de lui
Il voit rarement ses marmots comme un mec qui bosse de nuit
Il ne degage pas d’chaleur meme son meilleur pote le dit
Il a du fric mais n’en donne pas et s’fache quand ses poches se vident
C’est qu’un pauvre connard, j’crois qu’son cœur est dans le coma
Le peu d’bon souvenirs qu’il avait de sa mémoire, il les gomma
Même la vie après la mort il veut l’oublier
Il préfère se dire qu’une fois sous terre, on peut roupiller

L’homme voit sans méditer de l’œil de verre est l’héritier pour son ego est sans pitié
Mais pour donner semble hésiter

Sexion d'Assaut,"Oh Lefa, wesh c'est quoi les bails
T'es là, t'es dans ton coin, t'es calme, c'est quoi?

Ouais en ce moment je pense à des trucs
Je sais ap tu vois, parce que avant que t’arrive
Tu vois j'étais avec un kemé en cellule
Et bon depuis qu'il est sorti il m'envoie des lettres
Il m'envoie des mandats
Mais là ça fait longtemps j'ai pas de nouvelles tu vois
Je m'inquiète pour lui quand même parce que

Nan mais tranquille, à mon avis il est avec la famille

Nan, je sais ap parce que tu vois lui son histoire elle était bizarre
Tu vois j'ai peur qu'il lui soit arrivé des trucs chelou tu vois

Quelle histoire?

Bah

C'est l'histoire d'un accusé Non Coupable
Son nom c'est Malik c'est p'tet pour ça qu'le juge ne l'écoute pas
J'étais son co-détenu il m'a tout raconté
Encore une histoire de meuf qui habitait la cour d'à côté
Il taffait pas toujours posé au centre-ville
Avec ses potes la majeur partie du temps le ventre vide
Malik ne roulait pas sur l'or mais
Il avait du charme les gos d'la tess ne pouvaient pas s'en remettre
Mais t'as vu, lui c'était plus un footeux
Tout l'monde le traitait d'fou parce que les foufes il s'en foutait
En plus de ça, il avait du talent
Tous les recruteurs d'la région voulaient faire de lui leur étalon
C'est pas pour autant qu'il prenait la grosse teuté
Toujours au service des daronnes à porter leur courses d'ED
Le peu qu'il avait il le partageait
Malgré qu'il économisait pour que sa mère quitte son p'tit appart' à chier 

J'avoue, ça doit être un bon la wiss hein

Ouais c'est un bon mon frère, dans le din et tout en plus hein

Ouais j'avoue mais pourquoi il est béton la wiss

Bah t'as vu en fait ça a commencé dans une ré-soi 

Ce soir là ses potes avaient un plan ré-soi
Malik était pas chaud mais c'était ça ou rester chez soi
Dans l'ambiance une go lui proposa d'sé-dan
Il accepta sans savoir qu'à cause d'elle il prendrait sept ans
Le soir même elle le couchait dans ses draps
Elle le tentait en s'demandant putain mais quand est-ce qu'il cèdera
Il mit les voiles direction la baraque
Quitte à s'retrouver d'vant la rediff' d'un épisode de la star ac'
Manque de pot la meuf pris la ge-ra
Elle jura : ""Sur la vie d'ma mère Malik en chiera""
Il s'trouve qu'son beau père était avocat
Quelques jours plus tard il en fit part au proc' qui le convoqua putain
C'était la parole de Malik contre la sienne
Téma l'actrice tout l'monde cru au viol t'imagine la scène?
Le baveux d'Malik était bof commis d'office
Lors du vérdict sa mère cria ils m'ont pris mon fils
Sept ans d'placard pour un acte qu'il n'a pas fait
P'tite conne j'serais pas soulagé même si j'la baffais
Malik s'est retrouvé sous écrous
Les larmes aux yeux en repensant à tous ses projets qui s'écroulaient
Imagine la colère de Malik et ses collègues
Comment tolérer cette image qu'ils lui collèrent
Bref c'est à cette époque que j'ai connu Malik
Il parlait que d'dîn, j'croyais qu'il sortait de l'école islamique
J'l'ai pas cru quand il m'a dit ""c'est une go qui m'la mise""
Mais j'l'ai cru quand il m'a dit à partir de maintenant j'porte le qamis
On a passé vlà l'temps dans la même cellule
Pas une fois on m'a brouille-em sans qu'il soit venu dire ""laissez-le"" 

Ouais je vois, toi et lui en fait vous étiez poto quoi

Ouais c'était mon gars sûr!
C'était mon gars sûr!
C'est pour ça tu vois depuis qu'il m'écrit plus là
Je sais pas je me pose des questions
Tu vois j'ai chaud qu'il lui soit arrivé quelque chose tu vois

C'est quoi le délire?
Pourquoi t'as chaud explique

Un jour pendant la promenade
On a appris un truc qui nous a tromat'
Y avait un mec il s'tuait à la muscul'
Il était connu pour être le chef de son groupuscule
Ce mec là, il venait d'tel coin
Le même coin d'où venait l'vrai père de la belle tchoin
On a vite compris pourquoi il était bé-tom
Malik n'était pas la première proie d'la go au coeur en béton
Lui son but, c'était d'se venger d'elle
Il jurait qu'à sa sortie il l'attendrait devant chez elle
Malik n'était pas chaud pour ça
Il voulait refaire sa vie à 100% (C'est mieux ça)
Il a tenté d'le raisonner
Personne peut décider pour l'autre si son heure a sonné
Finir assommé au mitard complètement sonné
Personne pour te consoler aucune lettre de la zon-mé
Nan! Elle en vaut pas la peine
Et puis la haine que t'as, tu finiras par la perdre
Mais rien à faire, le gars était décidé
Si il pouvait s'venger il n'serait pas question d'hésiter
Tous les jours, il peaufinait son plan
Nan, le gars là ne faisait pas semblant 

Hé le gars il était déterre hein

C'est pour ça je t'ai dit, le gars il était déterre un truc de ouf!
Malik il lui parlait du dine en mode frère mus' mais rien à faire quoi!

M-m-ma-malgré ça?

Malgré ça, le gars il était trop déterre mon frère!

Malik est ti-sor plus tôt que lui 
Pour bonne conduite tout le monde sait qu'il était trop clean 
Depuis Malik m'envoie des lettres et des mandats 
Il me dit ""c'est des mithos crois pas que la taule forge le mental"" 
Il pète un cable il est trop resté au trou raye 
Avant c'était les cassettes mais maintenant c'est dvs et Blu-Ray 
Sur son front y a écrit ex-taulard 
Les gens le regardent comme un terroriste du Hezbollah 
Mais ce qui le rend fou par dessus tout c'est pas ça
C'est que le musclor doit sortir et il sait bien ce qui se passera 
Rien qu'il y pense, il me dit qu'il peut plus pioncer 
Ce que l'autre a l'intention de faire tourne en boucle dans ses pensées 
Dans sa dernière lettre, il disait vouloir l’empêcher 
De faire le con et de commettre un grand pêcher 
Akhi depuis j'ai plus de nouvelles 

Ah je comprend maintenant pourquoi tu t'inquiètes tout ça

Ouais tu vois j'ai pas envie de le retrouver dans un sac poubelle mon frère

Ah l'histoire de ouf

Je te jure

Wallah l'histoire elle est auch cousin

C'est pour ça tu vois les meufs mon frère faut faire trop attention!

Tout ça à cause d'une meuf Khoya!

Tu vois ce que je veux dire?
En plus il l'a même pas ché-tou! C'est ça le pire!
Tu vois ce que je veux dire
Et ça ça arrive dans tous les tiékar, dans toutes les villes du mondes

Même là, je suis sûr dans le bat y en a un tas qui sont béton pour ça! 
Y en a un tas qui sont béton pour ça

Oui bonjour matricule 75-0-0-9!
Ouais c'est moi 
Je vous prierais de vous asseoir s'il vous plaît! 
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Je tiens à vous annoncer le décet de votre ancien co-détenu monsieur Malik (Biiip) 
Wesh comment ça? Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé?
Écoutez, apparemment il a tenté de s'interposer dans une affaire de tentative de meurtre
On n'en sait pas vraiment plus pour l'instant
On n'a pas trop d'informations donc
(C'est quoi les bail?) 
Bon, nous vous tiendrons au courant par la suite si nous avons plus de nouvelles
D'accord? Bon, toutes mes condoléances, bon bonne journée

Akhi, tu nous a peut être vu dans un cauchemar
Sous pression tu priais pour que ta lampe de poche marche
Voilà mon équipe, prenez en de la graine
Sans nous le rap français est comme un re-noi sans la crème
Si ça pète, vite cache tes gosses akhi
Le bitume déteint sur nous, on débarque en costard gris
On cogne Starsky, Hutch goûte au taser
Et tous les ch'tars crient, ""Faut qu'y ait leurs photos dans nos classeurs!""
Vieillir dans le rap comme Snoop Doggy Dog
Bientôt j'arrête mais méfiez vous de l'eau qui dort
T'es bête ou quoi sur Paris y a pas plus lourd
On pèse des tonnes, le reste des MC's sont poids plumes
Mais tu vas où là, hop je te mets un grand pont,
Reste en défense, pour jouer en attaque il faut les crampons
Sexion d'Assaut, A.K.A la locomotive

Face à nous, vous voyez qu'ils sont re-lou vos
Flows d'ancien la famille, écoutez plutôt le renouveau
Faut pas nous laissez la place, les mecs vous aurez plus la cote
Car vos sons sont démodés comme les bananes Lacoste
Un incendie commence toujours par une flamme
Toi tu seras humilié comme un macho qui taffe pour une femme
Y a pas que du flow, t'inquiètes nos lyrics aussi chocs
On va te mettre mal à l'aise comme un non-fumeur dans un coffee shop
Les soldats de l'équipe marchent avec un mental rude
On déboule comme un obèse sur une montagne russe (Oh)

Je vais tout retourner comme papin, y ma faut du roro pour papa

Cesse de faire le survivant on t'as vite ché-cou sur le divan
Et moi si tu mets mon équipe sur ta compil' c'est sur tu vends

Les moments durs, tu veux pas de souvenir de aç
Tu préfères les bons moments où t'as la tête entre deux eins
C'est 2009, c'est le futur les gens sont deuss,
Les dealers n'ont plus de poches, ils foutent leurs tos-ma dans les seufs
Les indus marchent sur la braise, moi je marche sûr de moi
Si tes hommes naissent en taule, d'autres naissent à Kinshasa
Akhi, petit mais vif comme Gimli,
On redonne pas le sourire à un mec du Darfour en lui faisant des guilis!
Tu trouve pas nos sons, pas étonnant (T'es bête ou quoi?)

J'me réveille avec des maux d'tête
Gueule de oi-b encore à me remémorer la cuite hier
Pure zonnar négligé débrouillard et sans complexe
Au tier-car boula à Z refuse casquette sur le tête
On marche avec un oid dans l'boule
Puis l'euro poto pour ça qu'on vit comme des ghetto youth
Garde à vous des pots j'en ai claqué des fous plaqués menottés
A s'faire té-shoo comme des ballons d'foot
Au lycée j'ai pas fais long feu tellement j'étais naze

Mon ze-bla c'était le perturbateur du fond de la classe
Casquette à l'envers chez moi c'est comme ça que mes potes la mettent
Je préfère lever l'oi-d j'veux pas tourner le dos pour qu'on m'la mette

On a des yeux dans l'dos
Donc on porte nos casquette à l'envers
Et ça dans n'importe quel cascade
Aller op une casse-ded à ceux qui la portent comme un casque
Parce qu'on vit dans un énorme casse tête (akhi)
A ceux qui la retourne pour mettre des coups d'plafond

Échoué, le plan a échoué
Tu peux passer du blanc au noir, du bien au mal

1, la soirée se passe ils jouent leur avenir à 2
En 2 minutes hop, ça devient la guerre de Troie
Ils étaient 4 ou 5 sous l’emprise du 666
Et de la weed oui, surtout d'la 8-6
Cette fois-ci stop, ce jeune homme voulait du neuf
S’marier avec sa meuf, bref avoir 10 enfants
Il en a marre des coups, avec ses zinc’ c’est simple
Mais une chose qui est sûre, c’est pas passé 5 sur 5
Un dîner au chandelles, et tout se passe à merveille
Il négocie la main d'la fille en espérant que sa mère veuille
C’est la soirée d'sa vie, depuis hier Samir veille
Il se dit qu’il veut de l’argent propre, qu’il en a marre d’salir l’oseille
Il esquive même son cousin qui lui demande de faire des coups
Des groupes de mecs le cherchent : ils voient sa tête, ils la découpent
Du coup, Samir s’est rangé tout ça grâce à sa petite amie
Il passe une soirée parfaite en songeant à sa petite famille
D’un coup des mecs à l’entrée rentrent, giflent le videur
Déboulent dans le resto à 5 avec Samir dans l’viseur
Courent vers lui à toute vitesse, coups d’bouteilles au futur gendre
Ils mettent des coups d'pression aux gens, des coups de couteaux aux jambes
Des couples goûtent aux insultes y a que le serveur que ça enchante
Ils mettent la go en sang, en plus elle est enceinte
Ils bousillent les tables les chaises et enchaînent le vacarme
Ils débranchent les câbles, vident les caisses et dépouillent le placard
Ils profitent des femmes et d'leurs fesses
Traitent leurs mecs de bâtards (sale bâtard va)
Et ils mettent en flammes toute la pièce c'est devenu un bazar
Changement d’ambiance que d’la peur, personne pour l'dire aux keufs

Ok 5, re-noi dans une caisse immatriculée Neuf-Quatre
Sur un fond sonore du Prototype 3
Fonçaient vers la capitale quand l’un d'eux
Sortit l’flash de rhum pour se mettre bi-en
Il est minuit 6 quand ça part en cette-su
La caisse fait des loopings, ça devient le grand 8
Dire qu’ils s’étaient mis yes, p'tites vestes, jeans neufs
C’est l’histoire d’un cauchemar hiver 2010
- Allô?
- C’est ""un tel"", bien ou quoi mon gars sûr? J’ai la caisse, ce soir on sort?
- Si si bien vu t’assures!
- Préviens les autres on s’capte au café qui fait l’angle
Ce soir on s’fait pas recal' : j’ai 4 tickets d’entrée
- Ok!
3h plus tard, tu connais les blacks
Mais bon y a le plein pour fuir si un keuf reconnaît la plaque
Du Sexion à fond, direction la capitale
Ça va clasher du tiek’son jusqu’à Pigalle
Flash de rhum pour s’mettre en condition
Mauvaise idée, car maintenant ""un tel"" conduit saoûl
Il serre un peu trop près le taxi devant
Un radar, le taxi pile et c’est l’accident
Le passager devant s’cogne contre le tableau d’bord
Sa boîte crânienne se fracture, un morceau d’cerveau sort
La carrosserie s’écrase comme une canette
C’est maintenant qu’il pense à Dieu et l'appelle à l'aide
Mais c’est trop tard :
Les vitres explosent les bouts de verre s’enfoncent dans les corps
La caisse part en tonneau et fonce dans l’décor
""Un tel"" sort, et voit les gens en ang-s
Voilà ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance

Échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)
Le plan a échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)

Vu l’ambiance, valait mieux décal’ wesh on était pas plus de 7
Debout comme à l’armée à s’esquinter les vertèbres
Faya sous cool-al mais ce coup-ci c’était whisky
Sans cesse à débattre sur le dernier X6
Ce soir c’était nuit blanche des clopes j’en avais plus que 5
4€ d’nnaie-mo pour aller graille' s’mettre ien-b
3 képis qui rodaient en camtar' en moins d’2
Les mains contre le mur au bord des nerfs mais je m’abstiens
Y avait d’la se-ti du pilon c’qu’il faut pour sm’ettre ien-b
La ptite équipe d’élite 2-3 tits-pe qui s’trouvaient dans l’coin
Tout s'passait pour le mieux, mis à part un peu d’boucan
Un contrôle inopiné ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance
A la base, ils étaient venus nous demander d’bouger
Refus d’obtempérer, contrôle d’identité
Comme d’habitude, faut toujours qu’y en ait un qui s'branle qui jacte
Comme chez nous, faut toujours qu’y en ait un pour les ficha
Ce soir là, y’avait l’poto qui dormait dans sa caisse
Réveillé pour donner sa pièce, contrôle alcootest
Il avait bu, il avait mal garé son 307
Brutalisé sous l’me-seu du capitaine et ses collègues
Manque de pot la mif est grande, y’avait 2 d’ses frelons
Ça part en couilles de tous les tés-cô, outrage et rébellion
Strangulations, balayettes, patates dans la mâchoire
Dispersion on s’revoit main-de, là faut vé-squi l’tier-quar

Et cette femme, aux histoires futiles, pétée de thune, victime des médias
Eux ils ont un blaze très spécifique, ils appellent ça un sex symbol
Et ces gens qui te trouvent des problèmes même quand t'en a pas
Rien que pour leurs fins de mois, eux ils appellent ça des psychologues
La famille attend, on a pas fini de te faire psychoter

Ils embellissent le mal avec de l'éloquence : Parfum du diable
En apparence leurs noms sont clairs comme l'eau mais trompent comme la vodka
Langage soutenu ou langue de
Montagne de flûtes pour si peu de vertu

J'en place une pour les boubous et les djellabas
Les Fatimas, les Djenabas
Aimante et dévouée même jusqu'au parloir
Celles qu'ils appellent femmes soumises dans leur foutu parlement
Apparemment, ils parlent de moi et des gens de mon espèce
Tous ceux qu'ils traitent de racailles dans leur espace
Nous qualifient de minorité visible
Quand le physique n'est pas de pure souche, moi j'suis qu'en visite
J'suis qu'un fusible, donc je pète les plombs
Français que quand je dépasse la frontière donc un peu dé-clan
Ce qu'ils aiment chez nous, c'est les femmes et le tiep
Bien qu'on fasse tourner le monde, ils disent qu'on est que le tiers

J'me tape chaque jour pour rendre à dieu mon corps intact,
Car toutes mes affaires en fait s'appellent revient
Et quand je serai dans ma tombe personne me dira je te rejoins.

Même ce que tu bouffes tu le rechies,

Fan de formes courbées plus de vingt conquêtes en 5 mois
Elle fan de feuilletons, pensée qu'il allait assumer
Lui pensait plutôt combien de spliff il avait à fumer
Et a quels sapes il mettrait pour ses soirées dansantes
Pendant qu'elle flippait de dire qu'elle était enceinte
Et quand elle lui dit qu'elle était en cloque
Il s'énerva, lui mit une claque, disant 'Tes preuves sont en toc'
Il frappa dans son ventre en disant 'Casse-toi c'est pas moi le père!'

Une question très très gênante, 'Qu'est-ce que ton père fait dans la vie?'

C'est devant la fenêtre de sa chambre qui passe tout son temps
Il est devenu dingue te diront les infirmières
Elles ont besoin de la chambre, elle le préférerait au cimetière
Les psychanalystes multiplient les analyses mais banalisent son cas puis
Négligent la haine qu'il canalise
Ses membres se paralysent, seul il prépare la liste
Des biens qu'il léguera à son fils
Pendant que celui-ci se barre à Nice
L'enfoiré est devenu généraliste
Il a une femme, des gosses, écrit tout au?
Mais, il a foutu son père en maison de retraite
C'est pour ça que je lui souhaite, qu'on le jette dans une maison de traître
Des fois la nuit, ses pensées quitte l'hospice
Il se rappelle de quand au lit son gosse pissait
Il se rappelle du centre commercial
Et des flaques de larme qu'il laissait au sol quand il chiale
Toute sa vie il a, supporté ses caprices
Aujourd'hui la seule qui le visite c'est la rééducatrice
Il voulait sa villa, ses pauses sous Pastis

Va pas nommer les faux j'ai l'mal de mer pourtant j'marche en plein Paris

J'fais pas d'thérapie non j'fais que d'rapper

Sans savoir où aller 20 après j'fais la même faute
L'état une guillotine c'est pour ça que j'ai la tête ailleurs
Quand il pleut j'sors en débardeur normal pour un gros bédaveur
Plus l'temps passe plus j'perds de mes valeurs
Donc au final j'deviendrais un cadavre que l'homme envie quand il vit mal
T'accroche pas à ta beauté elle te fera haïr le temps
Plus précieux qu'un lifting qui te fais rajeunir le teint

Si je devais raconter ma vie il me faudrait plus qu'un son
Si je racontais ma vie mon bic serait presque en sang
Si je devais raconter ma vie je dirais dieu merci
Car jusque ici je suis pas victime d'un destin sombre
Donc ça c'est pour tous mes partenaires
Celle-ci c'est pour tout ceux au bord des nerfs
Akhi c'est pour tous mes partenaires
Sans oublier toutes les barres de rire

Je n'cesse de guetter l'horloge et j'crois qu'c'est réciproque
J'préfère prendre le temps d'vivre torse nu tant qu'il me reste le froque
Si j'ai pas d'sang sur les mains c'est pour éviter d'les laver
Avec les larmes de ma mère, pénible serait la chute pour un petit immigré
C'qui y'a d'plus lourd dans le bagage d'un africain c'est l'manque de thune akhi
D'une part ainsi qu'le manque d'études pareil, vite tarés j'crois qu'on devrait vite s'barrer
L'ennemie approche, sur la pointe des pieds
Parfois s'trouve juste à té-co celui dont tu veux pas te méfier
A m'approcher des feux d'l'amour, j'm'approche de ceux d'la mort sur l'compte de la fornication
Té-ma le rhytme de vie quoi? moi vivre deux vies?
A ma tête tu devines, fait d'jà voir le premier devis
J'garde le sourire et ça malgré un tas d'histoire
Ils nous pensent insensible parce que les bleus ne ressortent pas du noir

Si je devais raconter ma vie il me faudrait plus qu'un son
Si je racontais ma vie mon bic serait presque en sang

Donc ça c'est pour tous mes partenaires
Celle-ci c'est pour tout ceux au bord des nerfs
Akhi c'est pour tous mes partenaires
Sans oublier toutes les barres de rire

Moi je t'avoue que j'étouffe
Toutes les embûches moi je m'en fous je les pousse!
12 ans avec ma sexion
On balayera tout ça sans exception

Moi je t'avoue que j'étouffe

OK nique le hasard, nous on croit pas aux coups du sort
Tout est écrit même les passages les plus amers ceux qui passent ap
Nique le hasard, nous on croit pas aux coups du sort
Nos vies nous ont montré qu'le destin est plus lourd que tous les désirs les plus fous

J'ai fais des tas de mesures sans pour autant trouver les bonnes
Une tonne d'efforts sans pour autant changer la donne
J'me suis recroquevillé, trop gaspillé, éparpillé
Dans mes délires alcoolisés, claquer des tas d'billets
Contraint de dealer, normal quand t'as les poches vidés
Tu crèves la dalle mais c'est pas les hyènes qui t'invitent dîner
T'allumes un spliff, tu fais ner-tour, le seul qui reste, choqué
Par les critiques surtout quand on fait preuve d'un peu d'bonté
T'es la bonne proie qu'on pense aveugler, qui arrête pas d'donner
J'veux lâcher prise parce que j'ai les pouces qu'arrêtent pas d'gonfler
Dans nos ghettos t'es convoité pour c'que tu mets d'côté
On t'sollicites quand t'es au top ensuite on t'laisse tomber

Malgré tout ça, tes souvenirs, des beaux j'en garde beaucoup
Dis toi qu'j'ai du vécu et qu'la hass ça forge mieux qu'les coups
Maman n'a fait qu'assumer son foyer, anxieuse sans doute
Du coup tu nous as quitté sauf que c'était pour toujours
Au moins, il reste le daron malgré l'choc toujours debout
A part ça tu nous manque mais pour le reste on gère c'est cool
Ça blesse évidemment, ça fait toujours d'une pierre deux coups

Hiver 90 j'ai posé l'pied à Charles de Gaulle

J'voyais des blancs que quand c'était le Paris-Dakar
Et puis de temps en temps j'courais après les camtars
Il en fallait peu pour m'arracher un grand sourire
Il a fallu que j'vienne ici pour découvrir
Qu'il y a plus de sauvages que dans ma brousse
J'ai vu des surins dans des trousses
Des mecs sereins avoir la frousse
Et des sirènes après mes trousses
Puis l'sort d'un black a qui on avait dit ""Va, deviens!""
La réussite est savoureuse quand tu pars de rien
Foutue pièce d'identité, elle sert que lorsqu'on nous contrôle
J'en prends le soin et dessus j'roule mes joints
C'est l'récit d'un jeune black trop stressé, oppressé
C'est l'récit d'un jeune black trop pressé, d's'engraisser

A cœur ouvert sans anesthésie

Ces derniers temps il est tout noir, sombre
Blessé par des proches qui aimeraient m'voir sombrer
Et moi j'les aide en m'détruisant à petit feu
Qui deviendra peut-être une flamme que rien n'pourra jamais éteindre
C'est une des nombreuses choses auxquelles je pense
Quand j'me r'trouve face à moi même mais jamais quand je danse
C'est une des nombreuses choses auxquelles je pense
Quand j'me r'trouve face à moi même j'vous fais la confidence

Certains sont plus précieux que d'autres
D'autres te lapident quand tu pensais les avoir dans ta poche
Donc tu coules sous le poids de ces pierres sans sentiments
On espère s'en sortir en attestant devant 500 témoins
Je te dis que ce monde m'écœure, petite sœur ""Wake up!""
Concentre-toi, essaie d'apercevoir le monde sans make up
On me teste, y a du courant, faut pas que je parte en courant
Au loin je peux voir un tsunami de prostituées de haut-rang
Si tu te trompe faut assumer, un jour tout se saura
En Enfer t'auras tout le temps de faire les poses du Kamasutra
Es-tu vraiment français, quand tu possèdes ce morceau de plastique?
Quand tu dis que les femmes sont toutes des putes,
Ma mère en fait-elle partie?
Ça se concurrence dans les biens, New-York, Dubaï ou Pekin
Voilà ce qu'il arrive quand tu donnes du zeille' au Bédouins
Les scientifiques m'ont convaincu de l'existence du Très-Haut
Grâce à leur acharnement à vouloir prouver le contraire

Sois pas le frère d'un fils de pute, ça voudrait dire que t'en es un
Tu veux pas de l'aide d'un mendiant, pourtant celui-ci tend ses mains
Akhi, je viens de Paris, le blé pousse aussi dans la rue
Mais si t'en mange, le vice est la récolte de ceux qui en abusent
Belek ouhkti car la pilule réduit la fertilité
A faire l'amour juste par plaisir, on en zappe l'utilité
Oui on est au dessus des flammes, suspendu par un soutif
Car le sourire d'une femme sexy, peut également nous faire souffrir
Maudites paroles en l'air, c'est pour ça que je garde les pieds sur Terre
Tes actes t'enlaidissent car sans ton passé t'es super
Quand tu parles mal des autres, c'est toi que tu dévalorises
Akhi, l'alcool est un ennemi qui par la fête s'enjolive
La rue te fait tourner la tête, c'est pour pouvoir te l'arracher!
Je casse la démarche, boite déjà, pourquoi tu veux me balafrer
On est guidé par un bout de chair, qui évacue des impuretés
Comment tu fais si ta maîtresse tombe enceinte de quintuplés?
On se soucie de notre apparence, pour être mieux insouciant en boite
Ces ambiances dont tu dépends, se porte très bien sans oit'
Si tu te coupes de tes racines, tu vas finir par faner
Les jeunes rebelles contre leur daronne ont bien tous fini dépravé
Comment rester sur le chemin droit quand on marche dans les ténèbres?
Prier ne te guidera pas, sur toi on crache quand t'es célèbre
On est prêt à se faire niquer, pour pas passer pour des putes
On a faillit briser nos rêves à se caillasser pour des thunes
La beauté d'une tête peut te faire oublier qu'elle est vide
T'as même retourné la tienne quand elle sourit et que t'étais ivre
Aujourd'hui les gens de valeurs sont ceux que tu vois sur les billets
Rien qu'ils passent de mains en mains, et voient des gens les supplier
Fuck toutes sortes de sentiments, de ses dégâts je suis spectateur
Mais vue le nombre de ses victimes, je respecte la peur
Car si le pouvoir était humain, bah la panique serait sa mère
Certes on aime faire l'amour, mais faut pas niquer ceux qu'on aime

J'ai demandé ma route sans qu'on puisse me l'indiquer
J'ai troqué mes études contre un disque de platine
Tout en sachant qu'tôt ou tard ton public te piétine

Je reste sur mes gardes, je n'suis qu'un homme

J'me remémore les clashs, les concours de rap, la hass
Dans la rue ça rappe en masse, sans zapper d'aller nahess
Pour un 16 mes gars t'agressent, seul le kickage nous apaise
Nos voix, nos mains s'élèvent
Quand les flics sales nous rabaissent
Le rêve est à nos pieds donc on dort tête bêche
On baigne dans les richesses mais nos lèvres restent sèches
J'veux vivre de ma passion car tous les taffs me déplaisent
On cherchait que la reconnaissance, on voulait pas parler d'espèces
Maintenant on fout dehors la hass même si nos passés l’héberge
Ça veut acheter des caisses, attaquer l'marché des States
Si on a autant ramé, c'est pour être stock à l'arrivée
Pour bien steaker les stre-mon qui voulaient nous faire chavirer

Et tu nous suis si t'aimes akhi
Déterminés, on part au front sans armure

Non c'est faux, c'est que le désert s'traverse qu'avec des touaregs
Au square tous les dimanches mes semblables étaient absents
""Maintenant tu marcheras avec nous"", je l'ai compris malgré l'accent
Moi je m'en battais grave les couilles, c'était qu'une couleur de peau
J'savais pas trop qu'ma tolérance causerait la douleur des autres
Putain qui venait dire à Adam ""Pourquoi ce Blanc dort chez toi ?
Wesh le yassa ça s'mélange pas avec du porc tu l'sais pas ?""
Malgré le regard des autres mon pote m'a toujours assumé
Pour m'protéger il leur disait ""Joue pas le fou, il va t'fumer""
Les miens me dévisagent dans la rue, c'est dur
Quand j'marche avec l'équipage d'une nature exclue
Comme si je retournais ma veste alors moi j'dépouillais la leur
Mais défaire des lacets n'a jamais dénoué le malheur
J'suis fier d'mes origines, T-shirt ""Babtou"" sur l'torse
J'suis perdu dans ma ville mais j'sais d'où j'viens et c'est ma force
Le prof du CIS m'appelait déjà ""Le Blanc""
Etait-ce pour que j'noircisse qu'il m'insultait salement
Mais ça le manque de respect, un bonhomme laisse pas passer
Car c'est en se faisant tout petit qu'on finit par se faire écraser
J'aime les gos aux peaux d'ébène, ça frappe l'égo des gars qui haient la mixité
Tant pis pour eux j'suis traité de tout, j'fais pas de dilemme
Donc on m'a cafouillé, plus d'une fois la tête en sang
Car le blanc-bec frappait fort donc fallait bien vous mettre ensemble
J'préfère être dans l'ombre, c'est peut-être pour ça qu'mes potes sont noirs
Raté, ma peau est blanche donc forcément c'est que moi qu'on voit
S'taper, avec des bleus, la différence sera moins choquante
J'casse des dents, la prochaine fois tu m'embrouilleras en zozotant
Donc j'arrachais davantage et j'tisais davantage
Ouais j'dealais davantage, mais l'argent sale c'est lamentable
J'voulais montrer qu'j'suis plus fou qu'vous, qu'il faut s'méfier des apparences
A la base j'ai une tête d'ange, préférant qu'les 'blèmes s'arrangent
L'impression d'être trop naze a fait de moi ce mec tenace
T'effaces pas une tache comme aç, même si voir ma face te lasse
J'ai la peau la plus claire, peut-être le cœur le plus sombre
Dieu merci les ablutions vont vite éteindre mes pulsions
Ma famille comprend mal mon chemin dans l'Islam
Bien qu'il ait empêché qu'leur fiston grandisse mal
J'ai du taf facilement, j'culpabilise pour les miens
Certains keufs me disent ""T'es blanc donc écarte-toi de tous ces chiens""
Pour tous les babtous de rue qu'ont eu mon parcours atypique
On s'sert la main on s'reconnait, on sait qu'les jaloux rappliquent vite
Au final cette différence a fait de moi ce mec ouvert
Leur culture sera en moi même si j'porte celle de la Lozère
Les mères de mes potos gwadas, gal-sen ou maliennes
Sont devenues les miennes, la mienne la leur c'est la même
Entre les miens qui m'ont reniés, ceux qui aimaient pas ma face vanille
Y'avait mes renois sûrs qui m'ont pris dans leur famille

nigga j'esquive la parano de peu
Me détestent-ils?
L'impression d'être qu'une foutue tâche sur leur textile

Akhi j'ai grandit dans un tieks où j'faisais partie des plus pauvres
Là où les grands m'ont dit ""Petit argent facile ou pas, coffre""
Ma plume pourra te dire comment j'ai vu tous mes gars foirer
Preuve que la vie n'ressemble pas à une belle métaphore
La majorité des Blancs qui n'aimaient pas les immigrés
Après l'école, le soir, l'daron m'disait ""Faut pas les imiter""
T'façon j'vois pas comment avec notre loge de gardien
Rien n'sert de s'mentir à soi-même, c'est la hass regarde bien
Impossible qu'aujourd'hui je rappe sans être carré
Mes camarades de la primaire vivent dans des 400 mètres carrés
En parlant de la primaire j'étais la tache d'la photo de classe
Le photographe lui-même devait s'dire que le p'tit Diallo n'a pas sa place
Naïf et innocent j'me retrouvais souvent coupable
Parce que j'sais ap, disons qu'j'voulais plaire à mes potos les toubab
J'profitais de leur confort sans même savoir ce que c'était
Sé-po dans le salon pieds nus jusqu'à c'que la console s'éteigne
J'étais pas l'seul, y'avait aussi mes potes les guesh, les carail
Qui au lieu de le laver préféraient casser le carreau
Insolent peut-être parce que chez nous y'avait pas de G.I Joe
Frère de rue, de sang, si tu m'baises on s'dit adieu
J'me rappelle y'avait Dilli qui lui parlait le Lingala
Fallait qu'il parle d'abord le Français avant d'apprendre l'Anglais
Elément perturbateur, fils de femme de ménage
J'pouvais lire sur certains regards fils de ch déménage
Testé par différentes équipes dès que Paris s'agite
Ma couleur faisait de moi l'un des plus charismatique
Les voisins eux, j'en avais la conviction
Qu'ils étaient sincères jusqu'au jour de notre expulsion
L'huissier moqueur, ce fils de pute m'écœure
10 piges sont passées ouais mais j'lui en veux encore
Orienté loin, la daronne est témoin
Putain d'système scolaire, pourquoi la prof me té-ma ?
Limite parano, hébergé par un autre
Ça servait pas du maro mais bon le gava m'arrange
Ouais Dieu merci j'avais mes babtous sûrs

Bevor du gehst, mach' die Türe bitte leise zu
Guck ich werde für dich beten und versuche es zu verstehen

Ich hab' dir damals schon mein Herz geschenkt
Doch konnt' nicht sehen, dass du an's Ende denkst
Ich lass' dich los, meine Hände brennen
Ich will voran, aber die Bremsen klemmen
Gibst dein Zuhause auf und lernst jetzt fremde Menschen kenn'
Wenn ich das Beste war, warum suchst du ein Besseren?
Du wirst gestresst gehemmt, du hast vergessen denn
Was soll ich denken wenn
Ich dir mein letzten Cent
Gab und meine letztes Hemd trag es und schlaf' jetzt
Oder liegst du auch im Bett getränkt?
Du hast mein Herz getrennt
Ich würde trotzdem nie in Erwägung ziehen zu sagen, du
Bist ein schlechter Mensch'
Ich weiß du gehst dein Weg, stets gepflegt
Ich hoffe du findest diesen Jungen, der deiner Seele fehlt
Und dass du glücklich wirst
Ich wünsch' dir das
Auch wenn's für dein Verschwinden keine Gründe gab

Oh uh oh
Du warst mein Leben
Oh uh oh
Du warst mein Leben

Zwischen engem Beton, jetzt ist das Ende gekommen
Wir geben auf oder verschwenden unsere Kräfte umsonst
Ich verpacke unsre allerletzten Kämpfe ins Songs
Mit schönen Sätzen habe ich die immer die Ängste genommen
Mal zum Teufel geschert, mal in den Himmel gelobt
Doch das Missen deiner Person, wär' mein sicherer Tod
Ich brauch' noch Zeit um zu vergessen, denn die Risse sind groß
Doch ich glaub ich komm' zurück, wenn deine Stimme mich holt
Ich fühl mich wie auf einer Insel und ich finde kein Boot
Wir versprachen auf Ewig, doch sind die Ringe jetzt los
Jetzt sind die Dinge nun so
Und jetzt fängt der kalte Winter an
Du hast oft den falschen Weg gewählt, doch ich bin mit gegang'
Ich war der Felsen, der dich hält
Und sorgte bei Gewitter, dafür dass der Felsen nicht zerfällt
Ich erkenne mich nicht selbst, gebrochen und zu kalt
Alles gute auf dei'm Weg und ich hoffe du findest Halt

Alles was ich hatte, Schatz warst du
Bevor du gehst, mach' die Türe bitte leise zu
Guck ich werde für dich beten und versuche es zu verstehen
Denn du warst mein Leben

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do, that cannot wait

'Round the track they drove at a deadly pace

How his car overturned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath, they heard him say

Tell Laura not to cry

For Tommy who passed away

Sha-Shaty,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven
Shabaam Sahdeeq,"Hip Hop

Don't know what I'd do without you

Common said he used to love her but I love her still
She got a couple of my peoples a house on the hill
And when I'm the club she all I want to hear
My crew all here smell that draw in the air
And it been that way for 'bout 15 years
She took me through pain, sweat and lots of tears
She change like chameleon
One week she got her head wrapped, next week she got Prada on
She took niggaz out the hood
Got 'em eating good, got 'em feeling good, got 'em living good
The first time I met her, she came through the door with Rakim
She had me doing the wop
Hoping that feeling won't stop
Sometime I caught her on a conscious tip
But most times she want to yap about diamonds and whips
But she universal, she got all that with her
Loving her body I couldn't wait to hit her
Got with her had to get her in my clutch and thrust
'cause I love to lust, and lust to love
That's how I feel, she international, shores can't hold her
Sometimes she be in the hand of fake promoters

[Chorus]
That's why I love you
Hip hop I don't know what you do to me
But I love you
I heard some say they lost careers
But all I know is I love you
Hip hop I don't know what you do to me
But I love you
That's hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop

She took me around the world, explored the globe
She took me through highs and lows that's all I know
She ride in the whip with me on full blast
I love it when she boost that bass that fat ass
She flirt with guitar strings
Pianos and things
Been hitting it for years
Not a one night fling
She be in the west with Snoop, the east with Jay
In the south with Ludacris, midwest with Nelly
And the studio's the telly where I bust on her belly
Even though she a ho, I'm a pimp for sho
She got a lot of niggaz pussy whipped
She got lot of kids brainwashed runnin' round with pistols and shit
Pac died in '96 straight freaking that chick
Big went to heaven '97 loving that chick
And I spend a lot of time with her in my room alone
Blaze her back to back like I be doin' them stokes

[Chorus]

If I had to die for her I would, it's love for sho
It's love for rhymes, it's love for beats, it's love for dough
And when I kiss her and hug her I'm off into another zone
Thinkin' 'bout the times with her alone
Thinkin' 'bout the times when we rocked the crowd
Think about the times when we scraped up dimes to get smoke
And I love her just the same whether she Blood or Loc, Vice Lord or Folk
Got me happy like a new leather coat
Got me hype like I'm sniffin' lines of coke
With the mic choked in the studio droppin' em quotes
She got me hooked like fiends with vials of crack
Over and over, back and forth, keep coming back
And she made me cry when she told me Pun and L was gone
Rest in peace but they'll live forever in song, forever in song
Word, word rest in peace

God forgive em, got love for this game, got love for this game, uh huh
I don't hate on no forms of hip hop, love it all
Like King Sun once said to me and shit, hip hop like a library
You go in that library, you pick the book that you want, yeah, pick that book
Take that home and you read that, love all kind of forms, flavours
We got the hardcore, we got the commercial, all kind of flavours
We got all that, we got the underground
Go in the library you pick the book you want

Yeah
The once lost, disciples -- now found
Bound, together, forever

Verse One:
As I embellish, mentally I nourish
Resuscitate a mindstate that has perished, you shall inherit
his blood I require back, to Earth
we rise out of spiritual darkness, six thousand year curse
The lost disciples, bound, to the midst of the
bottomless pit, trapped behind the gates of the wicked wilderness
I hear the sound of the trumpets, blowing across the heavens
It's calm -- prepare, for the storm, of the seven
Shabazz, the Disciple, the holy, exalter
Condemning those, who sacrificin, babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
and unmercifully slaughtered
Loud screams echo, skulls of angry slaves
turning over in their graves
The white sheets are like white flags, you need to wave it
To the soldier, of the Lord, the warrior King David
I come to kill and crucify, those who trick and lie
In the eyes, of the most, high
The pale-face, devil race, caucasoid germ
Grafted, from original, black man's sperm
Thin-blooded weak, grafted-brain punk
Your power's a third of mine, you drunk funky skunk
How dare you use Jesus name to shell your filthy religion
My tongue be the sword, to slash you with precision
The justice system is his, the court'll only acquit him
And eighty-five percent of y'all are going to hell with him
The walls of hell, are closing in, disciples, we rose again

Unlimited volts, of energy, striking, the enemy

Chorus:
So come on and swing it low, sweet chariot
Pick up your righteous load, and yo then carry it
To a new home, and i-dentity
For my people, death'll be the penalty
Uhh, and for my folks I mad a-love
Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll rise above
And yo Shabazz, make sure you sing it loud enough
Peacein out to the righteous stay rugged and rough
And y'all get on down, come on now get on down
Swing it low sweet chariot... get on down
Come on now get on down, swing it low sweet chariot

Interlude:

The microphone and I'm joinin
Sharpen your sword, we must be aware
Them trick knowledge, they use to de-ce-I've us
You've been plagued with the mental di-se-as-es
You worship false portraits of Je-eh-s-us
The grafted image, of worshipping Ce-as-ea-are

Verse Two:
I hear the snap of my great great grandfather's neck
in a noose, hangin from a fuckin tree whipped-in mentally
abused, visions of great great cousins
Runnin across the field, unarmed
Ran down, and killed
I be the star to dispel the darkness
Cast upon your soul by inhabitants of Mount Caucus
Who praise the dead, and not the true and living
Killed Jesus and said, that he died for their religion

[Verse One]
Yo, if there's a heaven in the afterlife, it's crowded in the cosmos
Only God knows, in my physical dwells Allah's ghost
Many mortals embody the spirit of diablo's
Of all the plagues in the ghetto
We're either dead or behind bars most
Unlike them lost souls, I chose the right path at my crossroad
My life is like the scripture that was foretold
As days pass I uphold the faith
Praying God don't close the gate
This life is deep, but I could hold the weight
March in my Jehovah souljah state
Where shaytan waits pon'
God's path wanting my soul as he lie in wait
Control the population with guns, drugs, diseases
Got my people acting evil, strung out on needles waiting for Jesus
Once made in the image of God who turned savages
Get murdered by the government gang with silver badges
I feel them assembling in the dark plotting to assail
I hear the banging, from them fastening my cross to the ground with nails

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I seek refuge from Allah from the one who is ecursive
If the devil didn't exist, then I wouldn't have a purpose
The prophecy must be fulfilled
See I already died my first death
Just cause a man is breathing, doesn't mean he has the breath
The angel of death be calling spirits out the physical
Take a look through the eyes of a disciple, shit is visual
Allah sharpened my peripheral
Blessed me with the gift of prophecy
So I can see the wickedness you hid in you
Raised amongst murderers and criminals, once a master crook
I already know what you thinking
I used to give victims the same look
Let he who has no sin cast the first stone
Cause when my peoples send you to me
You'll be my slave in the kingdom
Death is only but a breath away
I pray I don't get left astray
Many are they who seek to slay me like prey
I hear them whispering in the dark, plotting to assail
I hear them fastening my cross to the ground with nails",Blasphemy

Put ya jewels up, put ya house up
Put ya tools up, nigga put ya spouse up
We can go at it motherfucker album budget for budget
And let your a&r judge it
Shit, I'll have ya label push ya project back
Cause I get hyper than a fucking hypochondriac
Ain't no responding back
My magnum mic'll push ya conscience back
Give ya ass a holy spirit make you haunt the track
I, I blaze blaze gun gun sprays sprays
Leave ya whole record company in a daze daze
Tell ya ceo stop calling my house
Or the next fucking song son, I'm calling y'all out
Better prepare for the long awaited, finally made it
y'all niggaz bout to get cremated!!!",Cremate 'Em
Shabazz the Disciple,"[Verse One]
Yo! Shorty was used to being jiggy
But then he fell off and did a bid
For spanking this kid up in the city
Sitting pretty, pimping an ac and kept a stack on him
Pulled over one night and his man stashed cracks on him
See he was wanted and his fam started flipping on him
His mind was haunted cause allah put a whipping on him
Shorty was feared and respected
Known for slapping niggaz and stripping them
Make them walk around the projects but naked
Nigga remind me of the goodfellas
But deep down his snake mans wanted to knock him off
Cause they was jealous
They made a deal and got him bagged, shit was foul
He copped to manslaughter
Cause he knew he would've blew the trial
Niggaz was skeeming all along and got acquitted on him
His girl and his man broke in the safe and they shitted on him
And now they're living the fast life and he's hitting that ass right
And got her hooked to the glass pipe

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
The game never change, only the players
While some inherit castles and thrones
Some end up death bed layers
Victims of the system and stripped mentally
Hit with 25 to life or the death penalty

[Verse Two]
6 months without a visit now he's getting worried
Up north scraping and yanking niggaz for their commissary
Been down for 5, came home and still wanted that nigga dead
Got on his feet and put rewards out on that nigga head
Running 2 spots, shit was hot so he fled out of state
Cause he's out on parole and his p.o's dying to violate
His world is narrow he's paro cause he's on the run
Walking in the building
With his back against the door holding his gun
One in the pipe ready to spank something
Cutting grams with his man
Holding the blade ready to shank something
See now he's getting major money
Throwing bricks and the niggaz in his clique started acting funny
He started sniffing getting high off his own supply
Shorty was slipping and his ass was about to die
Pimped his workers with high heels and a skirt
Now they're scheming to put his 10% ass in the dirt

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
He worked his way up from grinding
And scraping hand to hand on the block
And slinging rocks on consignment
He got plugged in, now he's juggling bricks and moving weight
And bubbling gats and trafficking big 8's out of the state
Faked his death and ducked the feds
But little did he know
That his ex had put a price out on his fucking head
One night she plugged him to a pick up
He's supposed to pick a brick up
She led him right into a fucking stick up
His world was spinning fast, the walls of hell were closing in
Angel of death was on his ass, his adversaries rose again
100 grand in the trunk to cop the crystal
He was sleep, that nigga in the back seat had packed a pistol
He put 2 in his kangol and twisted his wig backwards
Yanked the suitcase out the trunk, fucking snake bastard!
Left him slumped over the wheel with his wig peeled
Brains on the dashboard and blood all on the windshield
I watched him lay on his deathbed with a swollen head
Waiting for his heart to stop, cause he was brain dead
Angel of death was waiting by his bed side
He jerked his arm the next morning
And then a tear ran down his left eye
6 men carried his coffin, put him 6 feet in the ground
while I stood, 6 feet over in a black suit looking down
Thinking, why was I chose to survive and bear these memories
Fucking with that dirty game, death is always the penalty!!!!

Word! Yo R.I.P. my brother Rah, Bumpy, Junior, Herb
Know what I'm saying, just, Jeffrey, my man Stevo
They all were shot in the head!!

Shabazz the Disciple,"[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hip pop, they tap dance to sell a mil
While real emcees with skills don't got a deal
It's industry conspiracy to make us savage
Take off ya clothes to go gold, sell ya soul to live lavish

[Verse One]
It seems every man want to be a pop star
It's obvious to me that you forgot who you are
These labels will have you wearing high heels and a bra
Cut the roots to ya tree and watch ya empire fall
Now hip hop is a tree, and trees live by their roots
All the roots live underground, water down me no salute!
They pimping the culture, the same vulture who stole ya agriculture
My vocab is ultra, I insult ya or nurture ya sculpture
It's like to get a record deal, you gotta get naked and kneel
Labels ain't checking for skills no more, they want sex appeal
No publishing checks in the mail
Don't you know when you become a slave to money
That's when you destined to fail
You swallowing so you can sell a million records
On magazine front covers butt naked
Used to be a queen who was highly respected
Now when I listen to ya album, shit get ejected
I didn't get the album out, somebody cock blocked it
In 99 I smacked the blackball right in the side pocket
When I drop it take ya plaque to the pawn shop and hock it
I'm taking all y'all money this year, extorting ya profit
y'all got greedy and went commercial
And ya label's still jerking you
I'm starving all y'all niggaz this year, take it personal

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Fuck riding in limos nigga copyright ya demos
Cause they shiesty, labels are shiesty
Ya manager's stroking you, saying shows are promotional
Cause they shiesty, niggaz are shiesty
Stupid, the main niggaz who helped you get on
The first niggaz you shit on
You'll realize who love you when all ya money's giddone
They're smiling in ya face
Cause right now you're putting cake on their plate
Them the same niggaz that's scheming on ya safe - word!
It's the ones that sniff coke witcha, from broke to richer
Now they want to cut ya throat and come and getcha
Ya fake acapellas can't really rock a farvela crowd
Ya head is full of helium, you floating in the clouds
On stage fronting like the solo type
Cloned my hip hop chromosomes, deep down you know Shabazz ya prototype
Don't even know how to hold the mic, trippin over the cables
Mumbling and stumbling into the turntables
Tap dancing, juggling, shuffling their feet smiling
The type of niggaz I be snuffing while their freestyling
Whether you're gold or you're platinum, I'm robbing and gatting them
And slapping them with an aluminum bat and busting a cap in them
Duct taping and gagging them, make 'em deep throat the magnum
Trapping them in alleys, where we're beating stomping and dragging them
Fuck selling my soul for that mansion and a yacht
I'd rather make salat and scrape the bottom of the pot
Real soldiers survive with 3 hots and a cot
You can't take them riches in the ground when you rot
Must have forgot, ya fans bought you to that altitude
And now you left them astray, ego got you confused
Son I be browsing, they tryna trap us all in public housing
How niggaz classic albums only sell 200 thousand
Labels be running sound scams on ya cream
That makes niggaz susceptible on going mainstream, they pulling ya strings
With marketing schemes extorting the fiends
They ain't gonna never tell you how many records you sold seen
Peace to all emcees staying true to their root
Don't sell their soul for the loot
And planting seeds in the youth and fuck the

Shabazz the Disciple,"[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
We came a long way up from fighting court cases
Running the streets dirty with guns on our waists
Tryna be a man feed a fam and build a basis
Treaded the sandhills, hip hop is my oasis

[Verse One]
It all began up in 100 dwight
When my uncle younganutt handed me my first mic
At 13 years old, I realized it was a road
And at the end I would win lots of pots of gold
Never lost the flame, never divorced the game
Everybody who know me know I paid the cost for fame
To be a billionaire, the god struggled for years
Some nights I shed tears when I said my prayers
Been shot at a lot of times for slinging nickels and dimes
On the road to the riches that was paved with crime
I was sought of caught in between the streets and a mic
Niggaz never touched the knuckles
Cause they knew I could fight
Red Hook was one projects easy to get killed in
My mother always told me stay from underneath them buildings
I scrambled all my life, finally I found my purpose
I'ma be a disciple to hip hop long as the earth twist

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
My mother and Mrs. Irene had me, Klief, and Elliot sing
+Rappers Delight+ by the Sugarhill Gang, at her baby shower
Now I realize that's what gave me power
At 8 years old that was my first hip hop encounter
Then I went on playing keyboards with adam ellis
Only 12 but we could play whatever people tell us
In the halls of Red Hook, I was the king of the beat box
Back when me and Mr. Ice walked around singing rock box
He was the nicest emcee in the hook on Red Hook day
When niggaz saw us behind the ropes they were shook
We feint to lace the mic and young always allowed us
Used to go from block to block to battle
And people would crowd us
On staircases with rah and sha the ganja would spark me
I was fiending to battle dougie fresh, buff and biz markie
Was always a ghetto star and highly respected
Lashawna always asked me when I'm gonna make a record
People seen something in me I didn't see in myself
Shit I was only having fun, niggaz loved how it felt
My 2 daughters denysha, yay-yay, my whole family
I dedicate this to y'all for believing in me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I come from humble beginnings, a project apartment
7 kids on 2 beds, the rest on the carpet
My mother raised her brothers and sisters on welfare
As well as her own kids, and she didn't have any healthcare
Now we tryna get houses with cars in garages
Manage twa's, bubble hot tub massages
Laughing all the way to the bank with my goddess
Tryna put gold bars in the safe, platinum artist
No longer settling for the crumbs on the cake
No more embezzling or we running from jake
Shopping sprees copping threes rocking designer things
No more selling poppy seeds or hocking diamond rings
Celebration of life, everyday's like christmas
Taking my baby girls on trips, and fulfilling their gift list
Sending my ol' earth on vacation on the love boat
After a cruise around the world she comes home to a fur coat
Relax with black sand all up between her toes on beaches
Enjoying the breeze from palm trees, sipping crushed peaches
Shit, back in the days the only island niggaz been on was rikers
Doing pushups with them lifers!

[Chorus]",Oasis
Shabazz the Disciple,"[Verse One]
Yo it was all a dream, me and my brothers shakim and rahkeem
Up black crib puffin l's seeing ourselves on the screen
Our pictures in a magazine, we up in a limousine
In suede bally's, silk shirts and jeans with the Gucci seams
I beat boxed and niggaz flow till we was dizzy
My manager Mo, Chuck, Fresh, G-Money, Wil, Louie and Wizzy
Those were my favorite days when I turn back the page
And everyday we did a show, the staircase was the stage
And yo the name of the group: it was ""RAHSHASHA""
Whoever thought that hip hop would make it this far
At 16 we did our first real show at the miccio
My mother believed in us, she shot our first video
We would go to my uncle young's house every sunday
He let us do our thang, we had a hot tape on monday
I love them both for that, they always had my back
They made me who I am today, I see that when I look back
Red Hook day gave me the confidence to do what I do
Mr. Gus, Stephen Moore, 9-2 Crash Crew
RZA seen what it took the world time to see
I dedicate this to y'all for inspiring me come on!

[Chorus]
Talk to me y'all aha! aha! it's Red Hook day y'all
Talk to me y'all!

[Verse Two]
Hip-Hop is my religion son, music and fashion
Since I was a lil nigga yo, I do this with passion
It took me around the world from brazil to paris
Even on channel 2 news with my man reggie harris
Crime saga nominated soul train '96
Even though I do it son, I'm still a fan of this shit
When ""BDP"" said didididadiday
KRS dissed Marley Marl, Shan and Shante
And Stetsasonic had the Brooklyn anthem
We would rush a house party mob deep and vamp them
I slammed the mic when I'm done and kicked a hole in the speaker
When Rakim told Big Daddy Kane +Follow the Leader+
When Slick and Doug E. them said +La-Di-Da-Di+
When trench coats would hide the shottie to stick up the party
We was forever on that Brooklyn bullshit
My new projects posse was quick to pull shit
And fuck a fair one, you got ya head snuffed and stomped in
Back when that nigga Tim Dog made +Fuck Compton+
+Hey Young World+ is my all time favorite
Even now I still sing it every time when I play it
I dedicate this to y'all for inspiring me
And all my fans around the world whose admiring me
I had the vision all my life son, I came a long way
And now the whole world's invited
I welcome y'all to Red Hook day!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
My Uncle Cliff and Calvin Klein always knew I had the vision in mind
And one day it'll be my time to shine
Back in 1989 they bought me up to 105.9
They played my shit and it lit up the phone lines
Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see
A past time hobby about to be
Taken to the cinema screens and BET
And be blazin ON WQHT and MTV
Shit, I sacrificed my whole life for this
Everyday I roll the dice and pray to Christ for this, for real!
I sacrifice my whole life for this
Everyday I roll the dice and pray to Christ for this
Def Jam was always my favorite label
Since the days I rocked ""2 TONE"" leather pants and a gold cable
And +Krush Groove+ showed me dreams come true
All a nigga need is passion to follow' 'em through
I love Russell Simmons he inspire me to hustle and keep swimming
And never give up the struggle, focus on winning
This year I'ma do my thang, word to ""RAH"" who hovers me
I'll love +Wu-Tang Forever+, cause the RZA discovered me

Come on come on ha!",Red Hook Day

Stir it up easy to find the right position.
Don't rush, don't hurry now, take your time girl, get it right.
No need to accelerate, 'cause speed can kill the feelin'.
 
Keep it slow and sexy, instant aphrodisiac for the lover man.
Keep it slow and sexy, 
too much movement might hurt the back of a lover man.
 
So much passion, there's more where that came from.
Correct romancin' can never be overdone.
Girls, dey like it when I hold dem tight,
Make de love all thru de night.
Take time to do it right 'cause speed can kill the feeling.

Shack,"It's over now
Still I can't explain it
And that's who we are
I wouldn't try to change a thing
We missed the point
But didn't dodge the scars
See I've learned my lesson
I'm all right so far

Lost in your outer space
See that I found my place
I want to be where you are
I

And that's beautiful
That's beautiful
And that's the beauty
Of beautiful

Why won't you just stay the night over now
You need to escape but you don't know how
I want you to stay as free as you are
I want you right now

Feels like I'm running in place
You put the sun on my face
While I'm shooting down stars

And I can't wait for the day 
When the real you comes out
It's in your eyes and I see 
That's it's bound to come out
You say you know what you feel 
But the words all come out wrong 
Like excuses you made up 
Why you won't come out
You bite your tongue 
'Cause you're scared that 
The truth might come out",Beautiful
Shack,"People tell me they wake up everyday wondering if they'll be here tomorrow.
I say live for today.
Cause everything you have is just borrowed.
No progress made just sittin' around
TV's selling bullshit by the pound
Things stay the same are you afraid to ask why?
Fight to live! or are you waiting to die?

Changes coming our way!
Just like a new day.

These borrowed days they come and go
We live on, reaping what we sow
Terror from the darkness of our minds
The self-destruction of mankind
And we'd all like to see some change
But the shit, it falls like rain
We sit and watch the world turn grey
What's the point here anyway?
Changes coming our way
Just like a new day",New Day
Shad,"I try to hold some hope in my heart for these African youths
Coming up where I'm from many traps to elude
Surrounded by mostly white and affluent dudes
And somehow, you expected to have

Mastered this smooth, swagger and move
With the right walk, the right talk, fashion and crews
Souls subtly attacked and abused
And what's funny's being black wasn't cool

Where I'm from 'til suddenly
You started hearing rap in the school
Hallways admist this madness I grew
With knack for amusing through this little skill

For rappin' at dudes an' we all like to laugh at the truth
But when you young and same facts
Pertain to who you rappin' 'em to
Well, I opted not to bring that to the booth

But after a while, it sort of starts naggin' at you
The crazed infatuation with blackness
That trash that gets viewed and the fact that
The tube only showed blacks actin' the fool and I was watching

Saturated with negative images and a limited range of
Possibilities is strange

And it's sad 'cause that naturally do
Sort of condition your mind and over time
That's what's attractive to you
So young blacks don't see themselves in

Scholastic pursuits or the more practical routes
It's makin' tracks or it's hoops or God-forbid movin' packs for the loot
Even with this music we so limited, it's rap or produce
And that narrow conception of what's black isn't true

Of course, still we feel forced to adapt to this view
Like there's something that you're havin' to prove
Now add that to the slew of justification the capitalists use
For the new blaxploitation many actions excused

In the name of getting cash, that's adversely impactin' our youth
With mental slavery, the shackles is loose
And it's hard to cut chains when they attached at the roots
So what the new black activists do

For our freedom is just being them
Do what you're passionate to
Not confined by a sense that you have to disprove
Any stereotypes, so-called facts to refute

Or match any image of blackness
They've established as true
Perhaps we'll break through the glass ceilings
Shatter the roof and emerge

From these boxes that they have us in cooped
And grow to smash the bold that they casted of you
I'll keep watching

Mi chiedi come faccio io che minchia ne so
Faccio i pezzi rap, quelli hardcore, quelli dance, quelli low
Mi senti rappare dici ""minchia che flow""
Di un'altra razza discendo dalla scimmia che c'ho

Da quando faccio gli extra, tutti pronti a correre
Non spaccio, ma a questi rapper gli do la polvere
Io ascolto i tuoi pezzi e muoio dal ridere
Tu ascolti i miei pezzi e muori dal rodere

Ah, sti babbi che parlano dei miei testi
E parlano di contenuti come se non ce li avessi
Poi fanno soltanto foto nudi davanti agli specchi
Vi entro sulla traccia a voi vi casca la faccia dai selfie

Nei pezzi fai il duro dal vivo sei soffice
Nei palazzoni ci torno da ospite
A furia di dare le perle anche ai porci
Finisce che i porci poi sembrano ostriche
T'abbasso la cresta fra, ti faccio le treccine giù
Ho visualizzato la tua fine hai le freccine blu

Fine live, asciugamano, vuoi freestyle?
Asciugameno
E se lo faccio spero che ne chiuda una almeno
Fine live, asciugamano, vuoi freestyle?
Asciugameno

Ogni volta che lo chiedi io mi chiedo:
""Se i rapper fossero noi""
Che facciamo gli extrabeat pure ordinando una pizza
Se i rapper fossero noi
Che la tipa se s'incazza fra non ci lascia ci dissa!

Se i rapper fossero, fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero, fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero rapper come noi

Sputo, cago, stupro mentre rappo multitask
Fatti due domande sceme e scemo dopo chiudi Ask
Qui mi pressa-no, ma quale ""Web Star"" bro
Ti schizzo in faccia mentre guardi il video web-cumshot

Quante cose dette su di me, cose stupide
Ultimamente chiunque si sente giudice, più umiltè
Frate fatti meno cessi e più bidet
La cover del tuo cell ha le orecchie, man, e le usa piu di te

Tra la morte e amici la prima tutta la vita
Non mi ascolto la tua merda sennò mi spunta la figa
Vuoi sfidarmi col freestyle? Ma farlo in chat non è una sfida
Sono tutte un po' suicide, ma poi nessuna si suicida

Hai fatto due foto non sei una modella
Io odio la donna moderna
Se metto le hogan e pesto una merda
Penso che la scarpa diventi più bella

Non siete creativi, siete cretini
Incredibile che vi crediate anche divi
Mi senti rappare
Mi chiedi respiri
Svolto la mia vita mica i risvoltini!

Per un po' di soldi vendi il culo, music bisex

Mi si vede troppo il cazzo con la tuta da ginnastica
La mia gavetta non la compri su Ebay
Dalle battle in sei, scusa chi sei
Prima mi insulti ma dopo mi chiedi il bis 
Più che un diss, tu vuoi un kiss MTV Speed Date
Se rappo Drago Shenron oscuro il cielo
Ti affetto Shadeadpool uno in meno
Sicuro ti chiudo giuro il vero
Ti lascio mezzo insulto non ne meriti uno intero

Lecchi il culo hai l'alito che sa di merda dei tuoi fan

Io non ho tutti fan che ha Dio forse perché io esisto
Ogni rapper ha la sua linea d'abbigliamento
Dovrei fare più caso all'abbinamento
Ma non saprei che mettermi perché dentro l'armadio 
Ho così tanti scheletri che non ci stanno nemmeno i vestiti dentro
Che siano views o money tutti vogliono fare il milione
Vedi solo i soldi, eurovisione
Non faccio giochi di parole per fottere le persone
Gioco con le parole me ne fotto delle persone
Parli di big money, ma hai solo le big mani, un abbraccio Gianni
Ogni anno compio sedici anni, non sai se amarmi o linciarmi
Se mi sfidi rischi come col tuo account
Se lo lasci aperto senza fare Logout
Ti porto nel futuro tipo Marty e doc Brown
Ai tuoi live i ritardati, bravo hai fatto sold out

Non esci mai di casa stai tre metri sotto il cellofan
Metto in fila rapper come forza quattro
Chiudo quattro quarti e gridano ""Che cosa ha fatto?""
Se mi vuoi 4k più spese
Ai tuoi live quattro gatti come in cucina al ristorante cinese

Dammi il cinque
Figlio di puttana
Picchio quella dello spot del cinque stelle sammontana
Sballo i tuoi cinque sensi cinque minuti alla volta
Se rappi dopo ci vengono i cinque sensi di colpa
Perché sei bravo ma non vai oltre il sei
Incoerente come un cristiano sei sei sei

La tua ragazza è troppo piatta
E mi basta un dito per sbloccarla
Mi ricorda l'iphone 6
In più si bagna più dei sette mari
Vi credete sette re ma siete i sette nani
Giù da sette piani
Shade schiaccia sempre
Scopo pallavoliste
Schiaccia sette

Ti sento e mi sparo nelle palle come 8mile
Voi fate l'otto per mille per i like poi
Sono come dottor octopus ho otto braccia
Quattro applaudono le altre che ti gonfiano la faccia
Vai di corsa dove
Contro di me è come sfidare il mare a forza nove
Chi si sforza muore
Se vuoi la prova del nove
Chiama l'899

Questo rap è come un porno mandato in onda alle nove
Flow nazionale
Sono il 10 come Alex
Su di te metto una croce come il 10 nelle lettere romane
Se mi vuoi sfidare la cosa paradossale
È che ho dieci decimi eppure ti vedo male
Mettine altre dieci e sono venti
Tu finisci subito come un pacco da venti

Contro me hai vinto si
Come i quaranta ladroni di alì
Quarant'anni vergine e parla del tuo cd
Queste rime sono frustate
Provale e vedi fifty shades of Shade
Ho più numeri di mate in una fottuta equazione

Tu duri sessanta secondi quando fai la 69
Platino come il matrimonio dopo i 70
80 euro e Renzi ha messo l'italia a 90
Il primo che arriva fino a 100 vince
Scarica il mio disco sopra 105
110 e lode nel freestyle non puoi fottere
Supero 130 e la pula inizia a rincorrere
Catturo l'attenzione con 'ste opere
Con questa sono 150, ho finito il Pokedex!",Da 1 a 150 (Shaday)
Shade,"Quando metto i video mi dicono non è vero rap 
Non è vero flow non è vero hip-hop 
Se non hai la gang né una vera crew 
Sarai vero tu!

Metallaro fallito fai tenerezza, Piero Peluce
Fanculo Spit rivogliamo il 2theBeat
L'ho fatto quando avevo 16 anni e tu non eri qui
Andavo già veloce tipo Banshee
Avevo il micro nelle mani tu le Micro-Machine

Tu vuoi battermi ma non si batte il king
Io ho fatto le battle tu Battlefield
I miei video sono così belli che pure quando il video non carica 
È comunque roba da leccarsi I buffering

Fratè com'è Shalom
Bombardo come Sharon
Al tipo che sboccia io ci piscio in bocca
Moet Chandon

Fai gara a chi è più Hardcore
Rappers con i pon-pon
Va bene dai ci sto
Tre, due, uno, go

Frega un cazzo anche se ho fatto numeri da panico 
Contassero soltanto quelli farei il matematico 
Ho dovuto fare carico di un pubblico ormai saturo 
Che per la sua metà è fatto di capre come un satiro

‘Sta merda è mettere la vita in mano 
A dei cretini che la gettano senza guardare come volantini 
Qui in Italia c'hanno tutti paura dei clandestini 
Sono pieni di santini 
Tutti sani e Salvini

Tu mi vedi stupido per le cose che pubblico 
Sappi che non sei l'unico persino io mi giudico 
Ma dubito tu sia king of new school 
Al massimo sei king of New High School Musical

Shade se la cava beh ma fa cabaret 
Va bene frate allora falla te 
Puoi toccare tutti man ma non tocchi me 
Siete morti che m'inseguono 
The Stalking Dead

Rimo da quando il freestyle lo facevi live e non su FaceTime
La gente chiede ""quante punch fai?""
Finché mi viene il mal di punchline!
Ma che disco d'oro vieni qua che ti scoloro 
Quando vogliono decoro e in radio passano i The Kolors 
Stai sicuro sono io che non capisco loro!
Ma ‘sto disco fa paura quindi frate faccio disco d'horror
Faccio disco d'horror",Disco D'horror
Shade,"Il lunedì non bevo, il martedì nemmeno
Fino al venerdì cosi e sabato e faccio il pieno
Odio la vodka tonic, il rum, il gin lemon
Ma bevo perché quando bevo ti odio di meno

Mi faccio film in testa ed ormai sono giorni che
Scelgo te come Tim Burton con Johnny Depp
Non è un pezzo d'amore è solo un pezzo per te
Che l'amore non sai manco cos'è

È vero sono patetico
Perché la mia SIM è una dreamcard
Io che mi ubriaco solo per scriverti su WhatsApp
Da sobrio so che non avrei il coraggio
E visto che non reggo l'alcol
Ti vomito addosso la verità

E mi dicevi che dovevo darmi un ruolo
E mi dicevi che sono troppo buono
E ora mi chiedi come mai ti chiamo solo
Il fine settimana

Odio l'alcol ma fammi un altro shot
Così trovo il coraggio che non ho
Altrimenti non ti scriverò
Il fine settimana

E toccare la tua foto sopra il touch screen
Mi dà quasi l'illusione di toccarti
E non ho soldi quindi se provo a chiamarti
Il mio operatore mi manda tipo dieci messaggi

È troppo tardi amore
Sei come il mio navigatore
Che mi dice ""gira a destra""
Quando ormai sono già altrove

Ho il cuore cosi freddo che 
Se lo buttassi dentro a un frullatore
Uscirebbe frozen
Gli altri sentono il bisogno di dire che sono felici

Bevono perché li fa sentire più ricchi
Li fa sentire più fighi
Li fa sentire più re
Scemo io che bevo solo per sentire più te

E mi dicevi che dovevo darmi un ruolo
E mi dicevi che sono troppo buono
E ora mi chiedi come mai ti chiamo solo
Il fine settimana

Odio l'alcol ma fammi un'altro shot
Così trovo il coraggio che non ho
Altrimenti non ti scriverò
Il fine settimana

Sono talmente fatto che quando leggi che scrivo 
Pensi sia un analfabeta
È andata male visto che oggi 
Quando scrivi cose a caso di solito ti chiamano poeta

Avevi lo sguardo sullo smartphone 
E ti sei persa il momento in cui è caduta la cometa
Speriamo che Kepler sia abitabile 
Magari lì non sono io il peggiore sul pianeta

E mi dicevi che dovevo darmi un ruolo
E mi dicevi che sono troppo buono
E ora mi chiedi come mai ti chiamo solo
Il fine settimana

Odio l'alcol ma fammi un'altro shot
Così trovo il coraggio che non ho
Altrimenti non ti scriverò

Shade,"Silenzio silenzio in aula per favore zitti
Anche lei signor Shade si alzi 
Mi guardi negli occhi alzi quello sguardo signor Shade 
Non mi commuove lo sa? 
Si rende conto che quella ragazzina era minorenne? 
E lo sa che il padre è incazzato nero eh?
E come la mettiamo signor Shade come la mettiamo 
Allora signorina prego mi dica
Esattamente il punto dove il rapper l'ha toccata
Shade

Guardi il mio profilo e dici ""sembri proprio fico
Sei il mio rapper preferito con il rap tu sei un prodigio""
Con queste minorenni lo sai cosa ho capito
Che essere pro fica non è molto proficuo
L'amore non ha eta' media
Ti atteggi da terza età quando hai l'età da terza media
A recitare il ruolo della persona seria
Mi sento più Wikipedo che la tua Wikipedia
Pensare che dalle foto sembravi molto più grande
Non c'era scritto Retrica ma c'era scritto Brazzers
Hai un seno gigante mi ripeti che mi vuoi

Io non ti avrei messo manco un mi piace col senno di poi
Nemmeno mi conosci ma oramai io ti conosco
Da quante foto posti sei famosa in ogni posto
Sei una favola e baci anche i rospi
Ma per loro sei la bella addormentata ed io sono Bill Cosby

Più guardavo le tue foto più sembravi una MILF
E invece sono innamorato di una seventeen
E forse sono io che sbaglio a farmi un po' troppi film
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen idol
Se serve ti apro sono il tuo seventeen idol
Mi soffocherei nelle tue calze di nylon
Ti metto così tanti cuori quando ti liko
Che potrei fare I trapianti di cuore con l'iphone
A saperlo non ti facevo salire in auto
Facevi discorsi scemi alzavo l'audio e la radio
Copriva cosa dicevi e ora che sono arrestato
Quando entro gli altri detenuti fanno l'applauso
Ti avvicini e poi mi dici ""Bella festa
Non ci sto provando mica"" si bella questa
È peggio di tutte le altre insieme quando pensa
Mi scrive cosi tanto che mi viene il mail di testa

Spiegalo tu al giudice che magari mi aiuta
Che non t'ho mai toccata è stata una toccata e fuga
Che l'arancione non mi dona se mi metto in tuta
Poi guarda che foto metti chiunque t'ha vista nuda
Più guardavo le tue foto più sembravi una MILF
E invece sono innamorato di una seventeen
E forse sono io che sbaglio a farmi un po' troppi film
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen idol
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen

Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen

Più guardavo le tue foto più sembravi una MILF
E invece sono innamorato di una seventeen
E forse sono io che sbaglio a farmi un po' troppi film
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen idol
Finitela di cantare questa canzone di merda basta
È una cosa gravissima Shade
La condanno a 6 mesi di lavori socialmente utili 
Caro Shade avvicinati ti farò pulire
Così tanti bagni per le strade ascoltami bene 
Che quando andrai al cesso ascoltami bene 
Sarà la merda a sentire puzza di Shade",Seventeen Idol
Shade,"Non ti chiedo più quando ritorni, ma ti chiedo quanto rimani
Se litighiamo è la guerra dei mondi per quanto siamo lontani
Da quando è finita mi sembra passata una vita
Mi hai quasi raggiunto, siam quasi coetanei
Prima eravamo perfetti insieme, ora siamo solo perfetti estranei
Di gente che mi chiede ""Come stai?"" sono pieno
Ma non ce la faccio a parlare con loro, 0
Più dicono ""Prova"" più ci provo solo meno
Mi hai inquinato tanto dentro che ora ho un cuore d'oro nero
Che non ho un futuro ma per come sono stato
Vorrei quasi non avere neanche il passato
La persona giusta al momento sbagliato
Così triste che ho un sorriso smagliato
La camicia buona la metto al manicomio
Morto dentro e dormo sul letto d'obitorio
Amaro in bocca, colluttorio
Buona notte, sogni d'odio

Premi invio, corri via
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo
Mi urli addio, ma non vai via
E ti fai spazio nel mio letto singolo
Nei sogni sei quella che mi ama
Ma se mi sveglio, tu sei lontana
Tu sei lontana, tu sei lontana
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo

Spingimi via, dimmi che mi odi
Insultami nei peggior modi
Questo mare di indifferenza in cui nuoti
Mi basta sapere che ancora qualcosa lo provi
Sputami addosso, altro veleno
Fammi sentire ancora importante
Forse per questo che ero al settimo cielo 
E da lì che se cadi fai il botto più grande
E per l'ultima volta, lasciami in lacrime
Come la volta in cui stavo tremando e ho sbattuto la porta talmente forte
Che ho fatto tremare anche tutto lo stabile
Ho trovato dei ricordi, sono i nostri
Dammi solo 2 secondi, come fossi
Seduto lì vicino a te, mi conosci
Quando vado al cinema prendo ancora 2 posti
E mi sento un giocoliere al semaforo
Tu mi guardi da dentro l'abitacolo
Appena scatta il verde come niente te ne vai
E mi lasci da solo che devo finire lo spettacolo

Premi invio, corri via
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo
Mi urli addio, ma non vai via
E ti fai spazio nel mio letto singolo
Nei sogni sei quella che mi ama
Ma se mi sveglio, tu sei lontana
Tu sei lontana, tu sei lontana
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo

Mi sto addormentando mentre guido e so che
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo
Guardo il lato passeggero e non c'è traccia di te
Non esitare adesso che mi scrivi addio

Premi invio, corri via
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo
Mi urli addio, ma non vai via
E ti fai spazio nel mio letto singolo
Nei sogni sei quella che mi ama
Ma se mi sveglio, tu sei lontana
Tu sei lontana, tu sei lontana
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo",Sogni D'odio
Shade,"Eri così bipolare che, quando lo facevamo, era una cosa a tre
Anche se eravamo solo io e te, ti ho salvato con due nomi sopra il mio cell
E mi chiedi come va? Bene, anzi male, sono notti che mi sveglio e non smetto più di ansimare, ma sì, amen
Ti chiedo di non passare, passi uguale, lasci così tanto amaro in bocca che lo potrei masticare
Mai sfidare uno pazzo più di te
Non ti fidare della brava gente, il TG ti chiederà di me, dire ""Che strano, salutava sempre""
Io ti adoro anche se sei un'ansia vivente, e pazza di me, pazza di mente
Me ne hai fatte mille, ma mi passa di mente, il mio analista che cosa direbbe?
Sono il tipo che lascia le porte aperte, che ti sorride anche quando non si diverte
Probabilmente sei pazza da sempre, mi avrai rovinato anche la vita precedente

Forse stavo meglio, quando c'eri tu, la verità fa male, le bugie di più
Sei stronza e bipolare quindi ti parlo al plurale
Dimmi che tanto mi odi in entrambi i modi e non c'è niente da fare
Perché con te non so mai con chi sto a parlare, sei stronza e bipolare
Tu sei due persone diverse con la faccia uguale, sei stronza e bipolare

Il tuo cuore è diviso in due, un bilocale in cui c'è poco spazio e ci vivo male
Ti vedo lontana pure da vicino, lente bifocale, sei la mia stella bipolare
E dici sì, poi scrivi no, io resto lì, in bilico
Do tutto ma per te è il minimo, coi tuoi messaggi mi assidero
Dici che non sono più quello di una volta, non pendo più dalle tue labbra, ma da una corda
Sembra di essere in Alaska quando ci si incontra, così fragile che a stringerti mi sento in colpa
E da quando hai deciso di andartene, non vedo più il sole, Antartide
Riuscire di testa, parti per venire nel mio mondo, Atlantide
Siamo seri, sono come un regalo che non ti è piaciuto ma per cui ringrazi e dici ""Non dovevi""
Svuota pure i bicchieri delle stronzate che bevi, l'amore è cieco ma ti uccide, Daredevil

Forse stavo meglio, quando c'eri tu, la verità fa male, le bugie di più
Sei stronza e bipolare quindi ti parlo al plurale

T'atteggi figo appari tipo gli autoscatti d'Arisa
Ti attacco l'ansia e se ti attacco arrivo anche alle Ande

Attitudine di razza pure Adolf dice è Ariana, Grande
Allargo le ali abbraccio l'Atlante
Amo il rap vivo nel suo armadio tipo amante
Ho più palle di un abaco
Mi amano perché animo
Non m'acquisti su Amazon
È il ritorno del king come Aragorn

Ti batto alle battle muovi la testa come un Bubble Head

Sei così scemo che sulla carta c'hai nome e coglione
Cagna tu che mi fai il culo in frista
Non credo esista come un cazzo di Di Canio comunista

Dici donna dici danno, io ti dico solo donna dove devo darlo
La tua donzella su di me danza e salta come un daino
Mi dona di tutto dalla figa c'ha la tasca di Doraemon

Mangio questi mc come un Big Mac col mic
Non torni mai più come i marò da Mumbay
Non nego notizie sulla nascita di un neonato
Nato dalla Nargi con la nerchia che le ho dato

Ovvio che ti pieghi tipo origami se vi operi
E ti scoppia la testa Overyn
Potrei puntare a puttane ma pare sia un MvP
Tu fai il pappone con le piccole sei peppa Pimp
Quando arrivo al quindi investo qualunquisti con un Quad
Cosi rapido una rossa che rappa contro Risciò

Sono super sicuro che sto siluro non si sbaglia
Tocco tette a tutte tranne a te che non hai taglia

Man, I loose it, every time
Every time I feel the music
Man, I loose it, every time

Yo, check it, check it out, yo, uh-huh
Yo, check it

Sheist the vet, fresh out your ghetto tape decks
It's me and Nate back at it with another for your neck
Another for a check, means another for the set green
Is what I need to get, Cali's where I wanna be

And I ain't got to lie about the hood or the city
Shade straight from the sue of Jerry up where it's shitty
I got a mouth on me, farthest thing from being pretty
As I cash a check compliments of Nate and Dogg Pound-dation

Shade move the feet of every nation
Kids got the beast now, Trey about to eat now
We both got a plan to leave them haters in they sleep now
Soakin' in the sweat from the heat from the speaks now

Every time I feel the music
Man, I loose it, every time
Every time I feel the music
Man, I loose it, every time

There ain't no way, you're missing my call
Suddenly fall fucking with y'all
Homie can't you see me trying to get paid
Everyday, any kinda way

There ain't, no way you taking my bang
Let your ass think your pussy don't stank
Hell no, you got it all wrong
You need to move on, I'm singing my song

Tell me, can you feel the beat, is it, moving your feet?
'Cause it, surely moves me, well then, okay
Let's be on our way, Shade Sheist and big Nate
Just let the beat bang

Every time I feel the music
Man, I loose it, every time

{*scratching*}

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
Yo, it ain't nothin' new (ain't nothin'), just a change in the name
Sheist done came and changed the game unexplained
Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag 
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they want to marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door
Like I'm just wearin' this jacket to be hot
I flash the juice card, man this shit ain't hard
And It's the same thing at the same spot
What's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door
[DJ Quik:] No return fire cause they 
[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] We kill for a livin'

[Verse: Shade Sheist] 
They want to know why I keep it so simple
I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal
Sheist on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split 
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse: Hi-C]
Throat-choke a hoe, Big Giggolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your hoe
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere
Niggas strapped wit fear, uh!
Is he is what I said he is and all
When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch what's my name?

[Verse: AMG]
Hey-hey! we gon' hit these niggas where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo and skirt (skirt!)
Give em naps, give 'em dap, then I holla holla back
""Hey nigga where you goin'?""
Boo I'm checkin' my traps
y'all niggas done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes.

[Verse: Swift]
Swift, and I pimp hoes like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm ""The Answer"" like Allen I.
Got your whole style shook like 'Quilles or Kobe Bry'
While money multiply you haters ask why
No you can't stop the pimpin' the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on yo wife while you out flossin' your ride
But she said, ""if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by and come get the thighs.""

When I wake up in the morning, when I get up out of my bed
At all times I remain a hustler, at all times I be chasing my bread
Since this one's for my people, I'ma make sure you heard what I said
Daddy say speak loud and clearly, daddy say aim for the head
I think we all to cool to lose it, I say we all stay leveled instead
I say still we tame the hookers, I know we still eluding them feds
We make this one for the Negroes, and for the Caucasians who care
They say they treat us like we equal
I say they treat us like we just don't care

[Chorus]
When I wake up in the morning
When I get up out my bed
I will always be a hustler
I will always chase my bread
Since this one's for my people
I'ma make sure you hear what I said
I'm gon' speak so loud and clearly
I'm gon' aim straight for yo head

Yo, I wake up late but still got currency
Dreams, snooze button no I'm trying to sleep
I got bill and the ends ain't trying to meet
So I'm pressed for cash and I'm out of my league
Ya' see, times ain't the greatest and I ain't Ali
So my hours are nine to five and my job's the street
I'm in a low position trying to hope these mission
Crenshaw when exposition feeling holiday wishin'
And the block West stat and the spot we sure have
Rallies on Manchester, Inglewood on Saturdays turn to night
Shade always been the type to show love to those whom always doin' right

[Chorus]

Yo, it don't matter where you from
Not knowing not where you been
Can't go to sleep a child expect to wake a man
Yo, life is a lesson niggas who don't study
End up failing test and blame it on me
But see Sheist only gets what he claiming to be
A real quiet motherfucker with his heart in the streets
Hot in these beats, flow sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't drop my highest of peaks
I'm with the breaks so you knowin' what they saying to me
I'm impressed how many people end up hating on me
Like a disease Shade hittin' wit' a new vaccine
I leave 'em comatose falling asleep

Shaded Red,"I've tried to ignore
The way you're watchin' me
I felt insecure, didn't know what to do
I've been on the ground dialin' 911
I keep fallin' for you

[Chorus]
I'm fallin' for you
I've turned around again
All my thoughts about you
You know you keep me spinnin', spinnin', and spinnin'

Shaded Red,"I know, I feel this hesitation
Can it be real?
In my heart, in my sould
Until He takes control

Let it out, say let it out, Jesus
There's a hand stuck to wood
Held by a nail, it holds the two
Voice of God, unreserved
Why should I be ashamed?
",Let It Out
Shaded Red,"Feel my heart it's ever bleeding
Through spear and thorns
I gave you pardon
Won't you take my hand
And hold it as we fly away

I will be there if you called me now
I will run 'til I could run no more
I will hold you and renew your innocence

Though your sin be as red as scarlet
Through burning coals
Your past forgotten
Won't you take My Love
And forever you will live again

I will be there if you called me now
I will run 'til I could run no more
I will hold you and renew your innocence

Come enter in and be washed clean
From the traps that ensnare you
Know a real Love for once your chains now set free




",Innocence
Shaded Red,"(Verse):
This is a revolution...
It starts with me and ends at the back of the church...
This is a common solution for you and me...

This is a revolution...
Let us change the world 'til all nations see..
There is no confusion for you and me...

(Chorus):
I will never say I am sorry...
I will never say I am wrong...
Because I know the one that truly frees me...
No other love could be this strong...

(Verse):
This is the revolution...
Heals the blind and sets the captives free...
I know that love's the solution for you and me...

This is our revolution...
Now is the time to loudly proclaim his name...
This is our declaration, for you and me...

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge):
United we're going to stand together...

'Til every man woman child has heard...
The love that's given for free so all may receive...

In this revolution...

It was only meant for a little while
And now I can't deny, love don't lie

Throw away the victim that is you
