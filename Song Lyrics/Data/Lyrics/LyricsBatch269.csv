Lil Wayne,"[Chorus]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, we're a fuckin' family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doing this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish

[Chorus]
 
I'm going back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these mu'fuckers talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, guess I'm Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, gonna need a little luck
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a B.X. nigga, ya heard?

Lil Wayne,"I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka'
Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up
And drop it on yo fuckin' head, haha
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)

It hurts, but I never show,
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""Fuck 'em all""

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em crooked, boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die

While you wishing on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car

Soo-woop
And, then I leave a tub in the boot, I leave a blood bath,
Sorry there's a tub in the boot, now where the drugs at?
Like the string of the shoe
No niggas want that
I'm twisted like the string on a boot, where New Orleans at?
I build hip hop solely like a bus pass
So in your possession, I must ask

Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem,
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry,
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gone need g's if I'm bakin' the zeedy
You niggas want beef?
I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga, takin' it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like Eazy
Why do rappers, lot of rappers, lot of fans, lot of rappers, lot of rappers
Lie like actin', cut the motherfucker7 down
Cut the jack, fuck your props
I AM hip hop.

Lil Wayne,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos

I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole

Lil Wayne,"A young nigga screaming fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smoking rie
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat
I'm trying to stay under intoxication
Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinking liquor like it's water, getting pissy drunk
And staying away from them lil' broads that trying to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my waste line
Ducking the law, 'cause I ain't trying to do no FED time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of everything and keep macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep trying
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lying that the law trying to bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this

[Chorus: x2]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas trying to keep it real
And I'm still doing for my mother and I'm payin' bills

Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The FED's said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with another Brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she tripping talking 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
Trying to put me, a child, on child support
And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep falling to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas melting away
Man they got clowns right around me, killing they self everyday
We keep fighting but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck

I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dog I swear it's very rough out here for the youngsters
Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be bugging like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wrecking they brains, trying to figure where I'm getting that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everything was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gone be there
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but I thought eleven would be sweeter
Cause she wanted me to see her
Said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater
Left Ne-Ne with Macita
Vroom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how I'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cause I heard she was a freak
They say she keep it cleaned up
But I don't want HIV brah
Take her straight to the sheets 
Her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said oh Kisha
This what I got to meet her
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro
Oh no I got to keep her
Told her I'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go to sleep
I got some more meat to feed ya

[Turk]
Now I'm hot
I wonder was up with Kisha tonight

See if it's alright
For me to dip through
She said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
Baby it's all good
I'll be there in a minute
She didn't know I knew Wayne was already hitting it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog running out
He saw me dipping in but he didn't know what I'm bout
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Saying to myself look at this dog ass hoe
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Caught my nut now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie

Oh oh there she go
On the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know
We done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed
She told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cause she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smelling
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and now I said fuck it
Say boo I gotta ride
My baby momma beeping me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.G. on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good and you have it not to telly

[B.G.]
Bitch hold on do I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walking out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a damn job on them bolls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinking and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standing tall
What she'll do to a nigga she'll be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that hoe won't be able to walk

Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

[Verse 2: (Baby)]
I told four I need something
With some hell of a ice
Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing
These hoes doing ghella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20 inch chrome
Gimme the key, the car hoe, and the alarm
For my prowler, my jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20 inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the choppa is mine
Hit my block in my Benz hoe with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Ordered the tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the vc's and tv's so a nigga could shine
With my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job

[Chorus 2x]

[B.G]
I ride the best from a Benz to a jag to a beamer to a lex
Might fly first class on delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a reppa
Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moet, and Cris
See that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring ya bitch around me
Cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different
That's ya issue
But after she come back
Your best out is not to kiss her
Hoes sick saying damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at BG watch
That bitch blingalingaling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 g's or better
Me and Wayne take the left
Juve and Baby take the right
Its dark in the room, we hold up our watches and its light
Cash Money millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga weezay said, we surrounded by ice

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil Wayne]
Whoa whoa whoa
Now I'm shining baby glossing
Big tymin stuntin and flossing
Lamborghini sitting on broads
With two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari
With Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome
Vroom! sorry we lost 'em
I'm back
I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the hummer,
Hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jets about to land
The women fall out when I let em touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20 inch fans, damn
Got damn
Man I am
L-I-L, weezy, off the heezy
But still in all, ice flooding on my watch
And in my grill and all
Porch blocks front blocks
Still in all, me and Slim in the Rover
Beatrice brick holder, Cash Money young soulja

Send chills up my trigga finger, blast the dummy

What made you bring a knife to a gun fight, now that's not right!
Why your bitch-ass even showed up tonight?
Nigga, we use ta kick it like Tai Bo
I don't know, what made you go sideshow, turn jive whore
Kickin', trifling, dirty, and low
We use ta split chicken, ride ta Texas and back
I drive the rental car while you drive tha Cadillac
Shakin' like a pair of hot dice
Doin' 55, duckin' feds, law enforcement, and police
Niggas turn like fake gold, sell they soul
Treat'cha like Chicago in the winter, ice cold!

Keep a clean nose
And tight Teflon bullet-proof clothes

When niggas playin', they get drenched 
My pockets is full of lead 
So, nigga, stay off tha ben

But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems 
I lay back in the cut 
These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here 
We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here 
Tha lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow

Rocks under they tongues and, Ki's under they beds and

Until we shove a barrel down ya pipe suckers
Ain't no love for them busta, no pimp for no coward
No respect for no stunt, and no money without power

Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and blaka at every hour

Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins

End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggas murder on top, boy
It's the spot where they got Fire Girls and Hot, Boys
We don't know what being cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be round ya all day til it's ""400 Degreez""
And you see where niggas go, nobody be on the pulpit

Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Catch your breath, now sh, catch a slug

Calling weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Call out for that caper, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie em up put em in the vans, then put a gat in his drawers

Rabbit come home, why ya left us all alone?
But I'm coming man
Just wait at the gates, I'ma be running man
Arms open, eyes wide, full a love
You watched me come up from a scrub
Now ya see ya son riding everyday on dubs
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you
It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too
But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne
And see Cita, Mrs. Rose, Sheryl, Kemp and plus Sinetra
Dog, we really miss ya
And it ain't all that cool living off pictures
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me
Can't believe you left me to be a small man
But I know it wasn't meant to be
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me

It's up to you, Wayne, nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, cause everything gon' be alright
I know it's hard trying to make but it's gon' be alright

Alright I know it, see I got a child
I know I'm young, but when you left dog, things got wild
I know you probably saying 'damn, you raisin children now?'
But it's all gravy I'm with Baby making millions now
So I still smile
I'm taking care ya wife bra
Ain't nothing changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'
Things go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though
So you know who paying the bills now,
Still flossing, give my audience the chills,
I got all my game from you, man I ain't gon' lie
But I'm still thugging nigga, player you think I ain't gon' ride?
But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me
Yeah Slim and B done showed me 'round, all a the Jags around me
And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me
And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me

I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind
I know ya see me every time watching the boys shine
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD
And picture this, your little boy even on TV
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thing make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul every time I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leaving all the love to me
And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me

We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', ""Where's this bastard's crack?!!""
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, ""Slut! Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!""

I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga

If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt

I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your block
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved

If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia

I got her when I stopped her at McDonald's with her partner 
I jocked the way she rocked her lil Versace and her Prada 
I'm Iceburg
I jot her my phone number later on gave me a holla 
I popped up by her mamas so her nigga won't know nada 
She took thirty minutes play me like a some kinda coward 
Now hopped up in my car and started talkin' 'bout her doctor 
She said she started ridin' it in her babies fathers Honda 
She wish that he would trade it in and cop a brand new Mazda 
I'm drivin' to the to the back and put the top up 
I roll down all the windows put the car in function ""watch the"" 
I tried to touch her thigh she moved my hand and said ah ah bro 
It took five minutes to bang then you know she proper

We got the car shakin' and rocklin' 
She asked me for a kiss ah

As soon as I flew by in that navy and baby blue six 
She beeped and left a message that she come up with a solution

Lil Wayne,"[Lil Wayne]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet (Huh?)
They don't even much understand this (Uh-uh)
Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
for the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin? from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice

(Hook [Lil Wayne])
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

[Lil Wayne]
Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters 
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty, I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!

(Hook [Lil Wayne])

[Lil Wayne]
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Wheezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip 'cause they breath and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me want to beat a cop
I grease the glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house

Suck the dick 'til the s*** in her chest
You can piss on her brest

Project hoes like that dick, Don't bite that dick
Give me a Spanish sweet hoe
Black from Puerto Rico

Freak ho, Specialize in givin' me deep throat
Really don't care how short how plump, short or thick
Give me head, Don't care, Swallow cum don't spit
Aww s***, I like them Jamicians and them Hatians

N****s can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it
Its off tha chain

High yellow Mexican b****es they all for brain
But watch them hoes who want the change
Its not a game
Or short cuban hoe, With a fat a** though

An I'll keep the b**** just like Fidel Castro

Tell me what you like
Let me tell you what I like
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans
Ain't tryin' to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

Weezy the hottest
Drinkin' Barcadi
I stream through the scene on a Lincon on Robbers
Lookin' for the finest dime, To wine and dine

Later on I'm tryin' to climb behind ya spine
Hold up lil mama, Slow ya a** down
Pick it up, Throw ya a** down
Now throw ya a** around

An scream me name 
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame
Better watch that boy he nasty

I strap on a plastic
Break ya off like elastic
Put the dick in the middle, Make it wiggle for ya'll
Might be small, But that dick ain't little at all

I like a short thick broad, Fat a** an s***
Like Taso flip like Trina The Baddest B****
Matter of fact when I see her, Pull her Over like a cop
Juve coulda Backed It Up an I woulda Dropped It Like Its Hot


Ha Ha, Ya heard me
Ha Ha, Unplugged

[Chorus]

I like them big, round, yellow and brown
A b**** that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut

Bounce for ya hood, Shake for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that n**** who got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, Hold up ???
My b**** got thong, You b**** got drawls

My chick like to swallow, Yo chick like to spit
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that b****
Hold up, Chill out, Wait a minute stop
My Ginseng, Viagra, and a Strawberry pop

See I'm feelin' kinda bold, Why don't ya bring a friend
From vigina to the a**hole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever
Yo mama loved a Tymer, Now you welcome

Lil Wayne,"I know, I know, Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father 
Rabbit nigga, y'all excuse the expressions

What it be like up there baby boy, 
Aye this here ya son hollerin' at ya
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya
But I know you watchin', peepin down on how I'm livin'
Aye, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin'
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit 
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time 
That you caught me smokin' herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom 
And got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise

[Chorus: x2]
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know
But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog

I know you see my daughter growin' up and bad as ever
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin' from nothin'
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile
And me I'm on some squad shit and some debate it
But I know they love it way more than they hate it
And I know you probably laughin' at the way I treat these hoes and these 
Bitches,
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin'
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose C-M-B
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me

[Chorus]

I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin' above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me want to grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin' on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said ""they's my peoples""
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you

I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know
But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog

I know I can't be close to you (dog)
I know you watching over me dog
But the shit's that it hurt and burn deep
Its alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog
Rabbit, nigga, its your son
I'm down in your hole and your down
You see Cita straight, mom straight
Your mom straight, I mean everything going right
B and Slim nigga, is the realist niggas I ever met dog
And plus now I'm on some squad shit
My niggas, they keep it real with me
I keep it real with them
My little girl growning beautiful as ever man
You need to see her dog, she bad though man
Anyway dog, aight holla!",Everything
Lil Wayne,"The block is hot, the cops is swarmin' a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin', with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like ? come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin', hey its time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, Outta control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuous
Ball til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like ambasol
But he heard

Uh oh
There go them fuckin' po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner

I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin
hem gangstas doin time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles, and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist because lil man is trippin
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin' gravy, but save it
Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tecks
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fetti
Be on the block until them souljas hit it

Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin', shit is boomin
The hottest D in town lookin' for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin' qp's to ki's 
Gangin' in the cheese, them bricks is comin'
No droughts I don't sit on nothin'
I don't believe I'm frontin'
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin'
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin' to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay em a visit

I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter 
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious 
Pop some in your dreadlocks, What? Me not no rookie, boy 
Glock cookin', boy 
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy 
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin' 
Spark or lace somethin' 
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin' 
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America 
And in my hood the laws are scared of us, we are too terrible 
If I live to be old, it's a miracle 
'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical 
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo 
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you 
Don't blame me, society changed me 
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar 
Cut off lights, we masked riders 
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake 
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch 

We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (ooh!) 
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (ooh!) 
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (ooh!) 
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up, nigga (ooh!)

We hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (ooh!) 
And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (ooh!) 
(Did you see that?) 
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (ooh!) 
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (ooh!) 
Boy, look,

Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (ooh!) 
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (ooh!) 
Look, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (ooh!) 

Nigga, we put holes in you bitch-ass niggas, ya heard me

(Verse 1)
I tell 'em no lie
I blow by wit the Bentleys wit the O eyes
I low-ride, 'cause these 20 inch rims just make it so hot
You know I, been had Twinkie, look at the pinky
And the link be all the way down to the nuts, diamonds twinklin'
They think you need to stop they say it's not called for
It's such a small car for it cost more than a ballpark
See my life is high priced, a lot a room a lot a bling
My ice is like Andrew Dice ""Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing""
I'm tryin' to see flying in a Lamborghini 
Wit your girl right beside me in a tan bikini 
Cut the music down and tell her, ""hey ya man's a weenie""
Plus I'm hot and got more iceberg than damn Bananeeie
And I'm just a teenager and I make this dough
Pull out my bankcard and Bill Gates feel broke
And I keep it on a hush but I'm richer than normal
And a frost bit wrist, have me sniffin and coughin

You know, pistol on my side fully loaded
I drive slowly, wit televisions watching Kobe
Pull over by some broad; make her hop right in a blow me
And suck a nigga drive, then its, ""slut get out my ride"" 
Have you heard about, shorty be Iceberged out
Got them birds real affordable, so get the word out
And you still can see the grill wit the lights burn out
Nothin' lil' about the wheels on my bright orange drop
I'm thuggin and pimped out, flossin and glissed out
Sit my arm in warm water, I'm thawin my wrist out
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van,
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag
Shhh, You hear that, here come Weezy on his way in a platinum leer jet
We gamblin' nigga bet, bet nigga disrespect and he get dampled and wet
Whole goddamn family get trampled wit that

Alright I bounce for the 17 and jump for the Grover
Just put TV's and bump in the Rover
Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt
Wrists is ferocious, dick just bogus
Fuck a hoe watch she come back like a chorus
Life on Ann Deloris met her in a ???
She like to snort coke, you should see the size of her nose is
We really the ones controllin', no choices
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention 
all our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common   
'cause everytime you put them bitches on they start shinin'
The shit is mind blowin'
As a matter of fact I got a bitch that's mind blowin'
She give my head a blow job, I guess she's mind blowin'

You hot? F*** it. Hot as a firecracker. 
(It's gravy too.) I got a mac in this bag. 
(click clock) What you got? Glock. (Look)

[Baby]
N**** I'ma tell ya straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack
And I'ma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac
Just in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest
If I don't know s***, I know cars and broads
I done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off
And I done saw my n**** get life behind them bars
To them dog hoes, n****, we scream ""f*** 'em all!""
I hustle hard in these city streets
I got my block on fire with my HB's
Spinnin' Benz in these drop tops double are
Cook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard
And you can find me 
Right up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'
Got the whole motherf***in block loaded and smokin'
N**** know one thang: its some uptown s***
If a n**** get it f***ed, then we killin' a b****

[Chorus]
N**** I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go n****, see we can slide n****
'cause if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride n****
Look, I'ma tell you this, straight off the top
I got a blunt, and a glock, and a bag of rocks
Let's go n****, let's slide n****
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride n****

[Lil Wayne]
Better pay attention now so you don't forget later
I run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper
Don't make me take ya, play ya
I c*** the glock and spray ya
Call it a caper, won't be no as-salama-laka
And J, he got the gauges, they c***ed and ready
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off
Lock the spot down
Respect it young n****, I'm creepin' over
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever
N**** it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me

Chorus
[Lil Wayne]
See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya
Some of the, n****s that you run with are, suckas bruh
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
N****s can't hold me down, wodie wild
'cause all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
N****s got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But why'all gon' twist it and end up all gone
Dog-gone c***suckers, you not thuggers
I pop dozens of glocks, cousins, in my struggle
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere

[Baby talks till end]",Let's Go
Lil Wayne,"What
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy, a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute Ki's to the kings
and Z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Wheez, anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people,
when I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'm a be right on the corner, wodie, I'm gonna grind

I tell 'em, ""What!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' Ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind

I tell 'em, ""What!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' Ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

Nigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', ""Stop!""
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
'cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me, got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than ""The Three Lil Pigs'"" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga, Weezy Wee' tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

I tell 'em, ""What!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' Ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine

You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' Ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'm a tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar, nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time

[Repeat: x4]
I tell 'em, ""What!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time

What?!
What?!!
Look?
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that 'cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
'cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real (??) like bag 'Bauds
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?

(Hook [Lil Wayne])
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Lil Wayne]
Look,
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'ma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Wheezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me (??) without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Wheezy, nigga
It's Wheezy, nigga
Who? Wheezy, nigga
It's Wheezy, nigga

(Hook [Lil Wayne])
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Lil Wayne]
I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
'cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Wheezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who is Wheezy, nigga?
Who is Wheezy, nigga?
Wheezy, nigga
Lil Wheezy, nigga

My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it

Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff

and passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead

And now y'all know I'm the yee-yo muscle, man
But on the under, I got that wonder, to stop that thunder
That rumble in the side of ya stomach, piled on water
How do you want it, come through in a Coupe powder blue or
High with water, how do you want it man
Hey, I towed a lot of tullies dun, I den broke a lot of hoopties dun

For the nigga gotta move his son, and I show you how to do this son

Lil Wayne,"The streets make the hustlas
Hustlas make the world go round
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds
The keys, ounces and pounds is made from hustlas
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door
But you can't knock the hustle
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen
And my Jake but I put more 'd' on me
Lil' Weezy Wee gon' eat that's how it is
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz
And you know I put the mags on that
.45 mack with the flash on that
Who want it
Everybody sing along

[Chorus: x2]
Now I'm a ride 'cause I got riding in my bloodline
And I'm a shine 'cause I got shining in my bloodline
I get that dough 'cause I got hustle in my bloodline
I bleed concrete

And when I move, I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
To his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping O's with lots of hay
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-be	
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder be	
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here

[Chorus: x2]

I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoe prints
Cause I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips
The kid is a nuisance
Aw man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And the Blueprint
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit
Like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez

And for that cheddar, hungry niggas'll eat you

[Chorus]",Where You At
Lil Wayne,"[Lil Wayne]
I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number 
After how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
Cause she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix, laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers don't know shit 
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me (What?)
My love, my patience, my pain (OK)
Nigga please

[Chorus: x4]
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)

I met her after the fame
And she ain't even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good, I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard, I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life, the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit (Shit)
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend 
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody

[Chorus: x4]

You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
Cause all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you don't love them ho's
Love ya niggaz love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that
Holla back

And advance a little due to the pine

If the elements don't murder you the riders will for real
And niggas know I goes hard to the fullest
Get involved and I got' em' playing dodge ball with bullets, Yeah

Get fucked ya play pussy
We hit em' up when they ain't looking and them body shots hurt
And the head shots took him
Damn
And if the read dot spot him then the hollow head got him
Knock his top to his bottom jack
You see me grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom
At the very bottom of the map
Lou-easy-ana piranhas everywhere you at
You gotta weigh an extra condom and an extra gat
You bitch could get it for acting like a man
Them niggas in Pakistan ain't packin' like ya man
I back his hand ya man on command
In front of niggas he cool with the boys on fam
I'm on, I am just in different climates,
Ducking the animal keep on running wit my primates
You ain't did it till you done it like in 5 states,
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight
And in a drought I go on I diet and stretch more
Loose all that weight, leave a nigga with stretch marks
You don't even come up to a nigga chest paw, super,
What the fuck they play it in the club for
Real shit I'm ducking bombs from a drug war,
No religion but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord
Father forgive em' for they no not who they pushing lord
Father forgive me if I have to send them to ya lord
I'm just trying to dodge the shots they send to the god
They riding up highway to heaven boulevard
Damn, them niggas pussy and jive,
Not even in an eye exam they ain't looking for ""I""
The A and the K will make ya face crook to the side
Now when you smiling everybody gotta look from the side
Cause when you wilding you ain't looking, you just looking high
And when we hungry you look like pie
Sweet potato ass nigga, you lemon meringue, apple custard, cherry jelly
Don't make me get the biscuit buster
What up gizzle you my distant brother
Real shit nigga same father different mother, yep
I skip the fronting and sticks to keeping it trill
You not know me for nothing other than people you feel, I'm deeper for real
I'm deeper than skills, my speeches can kill
Rest in peace

Yeah, you under-dig, shorty its all about one thing nigga,
If you bout money nigga come fuck with us,
If you ain't bout money get the fuck from round us nigga
And whatever you bout we bout it,
However you wanna get it we can give it to ya
Order bitch, ya under-dig
Put ya prints in nigga
Put ya feet down and ya nuts on the concrete and lets roll

Hey, hey
You sleep in a field for trying the dude
I bust ya head until the meat turns ya mind to food
Foot for thought, think I ain't lying to you
I lie his body in grease set fire to him
I tie his body in sheets, put the tires to him
Make him feel the escalade, put his feet in the blades, damn!
I'm near heating and blaze a nigga keep
They ways when I'm in the streets with blades
Watch, my nigga hungry, he'll eat the plate
And if I ask, the homeboy will eat'cha face, yea
And though he got me, you can ask, I'm like a pool table
I keep the eight
My side pocket sideways
When I pop it leave a nigga sideways
For five days
Birdman talk to em'

If it ain't about money get all the fuck from round us

Hey, hey
Check my swag, I travel like sound dog
You play hard in the gravel like ground dog

Lay down logs call me ground law
Don't confuse me with the law, nah but just confuse me with my paw
Because I am the Birdman J-R
I ain't tripping nigga, I play the corner like Ripkin nigga
With the 40 cal Ripkin nigga, rip a nigga
Flip ya vehicle, split ya windshield
Wack ya baby momma but I let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still, cause the lil' nigga still rides on big wheels
You feeling animal then come on and get killed
And sig pill bandannas like banana's
Say I'm slight bananas I blow a weekend in Havana
In my cabana,
With my bottom bitch from savanna
Man a train couldn't stop ya man

And not a day go by us, 
We don't get higher than the telephone wires
Cut your telephone off we ridin'
Where phones don't roam they don't even come on
You're far from home so leave it alone
You creeping with the king of the throne
You sleepin' in a tee and a thong
With your hair in a pony
I ain't got no blinds 
We can stare at the morning (yup)
But I can't be there all morning 
I'm a pimp, baby girl, I'm going, going, gone

I'm sorry I was grooving
Gotta love that laid back Mannie Fresh music
But let's get back to what we was doing
Laid back in that black on Pat Ewing's

These streets ain't papaya ma
You gotta keep heat on your side
Two must, so I'm a get three more and cop you one
Wait, naw hun cause you ain't exempt
If your ass ever trip I'll give you a clip (yea)
But I love the way your jeans suck in your hip
And you walk kinda mean how you strut with a dip
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips
But I can't fall for you cause I stick to the script (yup)
I said I stick to my grip, 
I stick to my money, 
That's life to me
Sorry honey Jazze

Cause that's the only way we get down

I down down a brother 
We ain't cut from the same cloth you Downy soft
Bullets separate ya body compound a buster
I'm a find ya if ya hiding I'm a bounty hunter
In ya home putting dick all down ya woman
You come home we in the bedroom counting money
I bring her home and I fuck her on a thousand hundreds
Then I shoot the nasty bitch in the mouth for nothing
I say Birdman Birdman what's good today
We ain't never let them niggas take our food away
And we recognize real and got a rude awakening
And woke up together and our life was better
I'm the Cash Money son I live a life of cheddar
Not a rat though hat low Nike's is leather
Lil' maw twist two get my life together
Ya bitch meet me at the bar and we knife together, cut!

[Chorus]

Throw my weight like Sherman Klump
I gotta hold up my estate like Donald Trump
And I aim kinda straight when it's time to pump
I bring the pump when it's time to pump
Wrapped around my waist like a cumber bun
Don't make a nigga pump, you up!
I come in that new thing, she threw up
Now yo' bitch ass gotta clean yo' shoe up
I'm rich as fuck and I never blew up
Business mug, gotta get my loot up
Bet ya bitch get fucked if I ever met her
Bet ya ditch get dug you ever step up
One by one I push 'em down, fat bullet, fat head make a pussy sound
Hard head soft ass make a gushy ground I'm straight from a crooked town
Like that bitch!

[Chorus]

I give my arms and my legs to the game I'm ahead of the game
I dead any mane if he said anything 
But it's cool, as long as nigga paid when he came
And I'm a fool with the flame and the caine
Cut it just a little bit but the drain stay the same yeah
Young Wayne and the pain and the stain still remain
On the chest where the four made a mess yes
I'm still here in the flesh twenty one year old legend 
I'm a live way after my death
I sacrifice whatever that's left
I give y'all the last of my breath like
Write it down take a picture record a copy
Press pause only way you stop me fucker
I'm a get mine and make you not me
Spit wine in ya face if you watch me Bitch!

We lived, we died, I stayed, you left
Remember how we played to the left
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self
Member B and Slim leaving, hand the ki's over
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia

And make it Halloween and take all your bags

And Make these motherfuckers understand
Look coach you pitchin' at me under hand
But I am a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Ya men designing women I am a one woman's man
I'm the cash money prince blow the trumpet man
They say they want the drugs to stop
But I am a major step back when my album drop
I got that wet crack flow out ya mami's pot
I got that I got that jet black four at ya mami's spot
I am trying to get that dough I demand it now
You panic now, you better pan it down
For the neighbors be over here tearing it down

A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
Its money over bitches that I'm keep on provin'

I brought my bag of oranges, its time to juice it
This game is a bitch and I'm try to seduce

Put the laser on the 45 iron, stupid
One shot to remind who is the fly lil nigga that's behind the trigger
I am all chronic combined with liquor
You will never see me like momma tigger
An eighty's baby a fightin' nigga, I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I am something you call pepper like a viking snake
See me over the viking stove I am lighting bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out, I'm tighting clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting spliffs (I do this)
You catching my drift representing with my section on my belly and shit
I am the prince

[Chorus: x2]

So roll the carpet out, cause you fuckin' with a nigga from the royal south
See you are either in or you are out 
And if you out stay in 'cause  them warriors are out
Because those vultures, cops, and those lawyers are out
So I just open up the gate and let my holliers out
No nigga I never call your house I am probably some where taking Toya out
Not answer my phone and ignoring your spouse
She leavin' messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey, I am ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name, naw better yet point him out
Me and the streets got a joint account
I am from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans, wodie put the that in your mouth
And if we feed you with a lot of iron it will flatten you out
A few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never telling one another leave tht in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packing out
If I ever run into some trouble send my savages out
These niggas talking sweet I will get them cavities out
I got graveyard flowers man I am passing them out
Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now
I am the prince

To get off a bag or two or you just passin' through
True true, and we just passed the truth
Passin' through the streets of the murder capital
Where you think ya own brothers after you
So you ain't got no other brother after you
Don't let the boys in blue capture you
Cause they got pictures of me at it too

Y'all cats wit y'all feet up startin to look like feet up, I'm G'd up
On the V'd up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speaking bout no speakers

And the feds know just what's up in this motherfucker
Made niggas so they can't bust in this motherfucker
So with that lets keep it moving, on to the kitchen where my witches keep it brewing
Uh huh look at how my bitches do it

That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade him
Get too deep up in that water and they can't save ya
Me I come out of that water like I was just bathing
And watch my step on a wet pavement
Yea I'm from the hood so I rep 'em where I can't take 'em
Hollygrove Hollygrove was his last statement
So nigga get that look off your face
And recognize you got a crook in the place
They call me w-e-e crooked letter ""Y"" I'm so high
I skeet skeet in any nigga dime like she's mine
Street sweeper in the back of the hatch make me pop the latch
Leave you bloody with the cops to match
Bullet holes in ya speakers from the chopper blast
Like, ha ha
That's bullet holes in your sneakers got you hopping back
It all stop when they hit you in ya top and back
No cocking back silly motherfucker you ain't heard bout this
The clips ain't down to the dick
That's a automatic shotty from a drum they call Tommy
Guaranteed to get you bitches from by me
When I hit every piece of ya visible body he leakin'
Mortimer is no longer leapin' he sleepin'
While you pussy niggas is sleeping he thinking
Deep in thought the boy ain't even winkin'
Bob Marley got me stinking
Stacking figures I'm standing firm life's a slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins from where I came
Though I bear a name only one call live with
Coach they won't knock me off my pivot forget it
I'm sicker with it
Pick a city buy a condo find a fine hoe let some time go chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo' about dough
Nothing! man the four wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tank-top pocket fan
No pocket knife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat boom!
Ha ha tonight I might just boost my feature price
Cause to each its own and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like mike at a Tyson fight
I'm from Cita house big momma's house
She told me to shoot ya right after I knock ya out
And he ain't getting up after them shots
If you hit him in the right spot
Hold up the beat might drop

Oh no, no, oh no, no",Oh No
Lil Wayne,"Yea, yea, yea
Weezy baby y'all, (yeah)
Don't get shot
Rapid fire, what you know about it?

Yeah, you still in the carter 2 people

Hey yeah,
All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise
A fist full of dollars, a list full of problems
I'll address them like P.O. Boxes
Yeah I'm from New Orleans, the Creole c***pit
We so out of it, zero tolerance
Gangster gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it
I'm wealthy, still f***in' with that block s***
Wet your a** up, head to feet till your sock a drip
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your a**
No snakes at the carter, tell the gardener to cut the gra**
I hear 'em but they talking under ma**
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof gla**
That's Cash Money, honey pie
We ain't runnin', we don't hide screamin' f*** the other side
Don't get caught on it, this the dailiest grind
I'll put your heart on it and walk on it
The chalks only for the art homie
How they trace ya after I erase ya
Look around, we at war and you still in preparation
I'm riding for them reparations, no patience
Slow paper is better than no paper
Fast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it
You gotta know that paper
If you got it from a caper, you gotta blow that paper
Gotta know that photo-fobia, no Kodak moments
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em
Nah, I ain't even in the school yearbook
I don't do too much posin', got a cool killer look
Career crook, get your career took
I'm back like a brassiere hook
B**** cheer, camouflage gear, the hunter's here
Better play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer
Around here and this here is The Carter
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter
But get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada
I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em
On the head at the bottom

And I ain't gotta get 'em cause I already got 'em

Lil Wayne,"So ""Little Wayne,"" whats your motivation? 

Is that really a question?
Do you really have that written down in your notepad? 
You should be ashamed of yourself
You smell me girl 
I smell like money 
See, that's what they don't understand 
(Tell 'em a god damn thing) 
To me it was always get money or die 
I come up under Birdman the number one stunner 
You know what I mean I'm stunner junior 
That's all I know that's all I ever knew 
Get money or get nothing you know what I'm saying 
And I feel that way 
For real 

So hard I go I keep pushing 
The game so crazy I'm in it like deep p**** 
I got chips from trying to get the whole cookie 
Used to make a thousand dollars every time I played hookie 
Dwayne Carter absent keep looking 
I'm present on the block 
I'm a legend on the block 
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch 
Yea n**** I done dropped one eleven on the watch 
So watch and see what I do 
Breeze by you so fast got you sneezing
They got the shivers man I got the fever 
I got to bring the hood back after Katrina 
Weezy F. Baby now the F is for Fema
Sick n**** b**** I spit that Leukemia 
Yea no cure no help 
So me so good so hard so felt 
Feel me 

And that's just my point right there 
That's what I'm always trying to stress know what I'm saying 
If you don't understand me if you don't feel me then you ain't real 
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me, you know?

So, is your music considered the voice of urban America 
Or America period? 

I mean, I would say the voice of the hood, cause that's who I speak for 
And myself, you know what I mean, my family that's who I represent 
My homies, my girl, my life you know 

C'mon, bang this s*** n**** pump my s*** 
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that b**** 
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that b**** 
You gotta aim that s*** and straight bust that s***

Tevin Campbell, no homo, black Rambo 
F***ing with the boy baby that's a gamble
If he won in Vegas leave him on the crap table 
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable 
Like nobody make a sound where the paper where the paper 
Gotta get it gotta have it 
Once I got it I'm a spend it 
Then its back to doing any damn thing just to get it 
The re-ups be like birthday parties 
No room to park the cars in the garages 
So outside the cribs all you see is arragis 
If I ain't say it right f*** it I ain't foreign 
Feel me 

And see 
That's where everybody get me wrong at 
You know what I mean 
I got that heat rock, for real 
 
Why do you think other rappers 
Lack the impact of your music?

That's because they ain't got that heat rock like me 
You know what I mean 
They ain't spitting like me 
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds 
I got the flu over here man, for real 
I need relief, y'all help me 
I know y'all sick of me, 
'cause I'm tired of y'all for real 

And based on the bank, 
I'm doing much better than a lot of these n****s 
I'm tired of these n****s 
Yawning when I see them make me stretch and pull the burner 
I'm c***ing back and pa**ing 
They catch 'em in they sternum 
Ooh ooh that gone probably burn ya 
That gone probably learn ya 
To never ever ever, ever ever ever come around here no more 
Rich gangsters over here you gotta die with the broke b**** 
I'm the God I should ride with the Pope 
But the boy so hood I just ride with my hoe yeah 
Yeah, and tell 'em bout Hollygrove 
Tell 'em bout my last show

He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya 
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to 
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor 
Standing on stage in front of thousands 
Don't amount to me not having my father 
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em 
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em 
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all 
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard 
I'm alright God, s*** I'm still breathing
But lose hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleeding

F*** who don't understand it, this what the game did us 
This what the streets showed us 
This how the block made us,

I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me 
Lord will I be next for the taking? Take me 
I know I'm living like I know when I'm coming 
But I'm just living cause I know that it's coming
And the end is coming, but I ain't running 
I and hiding and ducking, I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it 
I'm just speaking from the heart of the dieing public 
We still beating, we goin' rise above it 
Though it seem like they cheatin' and we loosing
We survive if nothing, they could never take the stride from struggling 
I gotta ride 
And sometimes that ride get bloody 
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uh 

Oh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, we gotta get over 
It's almost over, and we gon' be alright

We getting red now, b**** my n**** dead now 
And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now 
I should of said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds 
Now I gotta walk around, brim down 
Just trying to find my way to the next day, escape 
Ya birthday could be ya death date 
So I'm living like it was just yesterday, let's pray 
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together 
It's murder murder, I don't think it get better 
So be a competitor or get out the weather 
Me? I got a umbrella and a Beretta 
I'm just trying to make sure my daughter future progressing 
And behind that, I'm shooting excessive, trust me 
The beautiful dead, we living wit the ugly 
I just tell my pops wait for me, I'm coming

Cause I don't wanna see nothing! Yea,

Life ain't nothing but a long extended road, keep driving

Playa f*** around wit' the homeless, charmless
You can leave out here armless, no homies
Honest, you n****s is harmless
I'm calm as a Don is supposed to (be)
Costa Nostra, don't ever approach him 
Don't get close to him
Shootouts and nothin' but rock n roll to him
Leave your blood on the dash, call it rosewood
'Nother murder, 'nother page out the notebook
It ain't nothin' it don't make it if you no good
I tried to talk to him, but then a n**** had to

Hit 'em up, 
Hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up really,

But, uh, that chopper rocked, 
Put his head in his arms
And man, 
I tried to talk to him, 
I tried to talk to him
Hit 'em up, 
Hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, 
F*** it make a n**** get loose

Stop runnin' your mouth
No shoes, no feet, I'll run in your mouth
I'll come to your house, me and my goons
Loadin' up bangers, ridin' under the moon
Throwin' up fingers sayin' ""My side rule""
If a n**** disagree, that's when my side prove 
That Maybach coupe a c***-eyed fool
And I'm ""in it like Bennett"" hoe, aren't I cool
But if that thermostat switch and that needle move
Then the attitude switch and the heat'll move
I got that, Shakita banana, clip for the tool
Meet a disaster, pity the fool, eat a catastrophe
Swallow the truth, belch reality
How does it taste, powder your face, 
You a b**** n****
All p****, stop cummin' out your lips n****
I tried to talk him, but then a n**** had to

[Chorus]

Real talk boy, chill wit' the talk boy
That Tommy Gun'll tear your neighborhood apart boy
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart boy
Start with the wrong boy, it end wit' a song boy
Wit' your friends, to carry you alone
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone
F*** discussion, I ain't in to it boy
I just get to it, let's do it, rip through a boy
Big Uzi, tissue the boy
I'm inside lookin' out, you just an intruder boy
You need sutures on your smooches boy

An' that's real an' I would never turn my back or turn ya down
Even if you turned around, muthafucka
But history is history

For only you I was in the game

You was my nigga, my nerd, my joy, my herb
My main muthafuckin' man, Turk
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved

We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left
Remember how we played to the left
An' we stayed out of trouble 'cuz we stayed to our self

Member B an' Slim were leavin', hand the ki's over
Tell me not to go Uptown an' we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas
An' yo' mom an' brothers, while I lied to the stunna

Yea, those were the times, my brother
Now I recognize real an' I honor my brother
Yea, nigga sub mage my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The nigga you left behind is my brothers

Man, I miss my dawgs
Many nights, club hoppin'
Many nights, we were blowin' trees
Many nights, we were hustlin'

Me an' you, through thick an' thin
Me an' you, to the very end
For only you I was in the game

Man, I miss my dawgs
Many nights, club hoppin'

That King Kong, yea I bet ya this gon' be the theme song
Cause that King Kong will have your ears ringing like a ring tone

King Kong, king, king, king, king kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong

King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

[Verse 3] 
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Them boys is knockin', I got it on lock
Cause I make hits like I'm boxing
Start it up and it sound like a block hit it
Then a hater, hating inside, like don't pop with this
See the beats will beat, ya hear me before you see me
Before you even can reach me, it'll have ya thinking
That this boy is a beast in the streets
While ya blinking, have ya bopper looking like you been drinking
I'll eat ya, it's like I have speakers in my speakers
So when they speaking on it all they gon' speak of is a beaster boy
So don't make me just treat ya to a feast

A beast'll just beat off both of your ear drums

[Chorus]
King Kong, king, king, king, king kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
If you hear before you see me [x3]

Lil Wayne,"[Intro: Phonte]
Hey baby look here, this new song I wrote it's got that nice groove
That everybody dancin' to
And when I play it it kind of remind me of me and you
I mean, it's it's one more thing I wanna talk about now look
It's It's It's time now for you to come home now
Look everybody got there problems I'm dealin' with mine
I I I done gave up my narcotic, I'm a changed man!

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, how many ways can I say I'm done fishin?
You wanted the role, smashed the audition
Havin' a partner for a man in my position
Eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women
And some say that it was the life I was given
I say it don't matter if I work at Mickey D's
I still got a fix for what you got between your knees
On a new broad, you still one to one
Every once and again I like havin' some fun
No disrespect intended but what's done is done
Women steppin' out for love, men do it to cum
""Not a Player"" like Pun, but when shorty's get to grabbin' on me
The last thought I get is, ""Poobie run! ""
To them girls wishin' all the starters will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is, hon - One!

[Chorus: Phonte (R&B Sample)]
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin' my heart (Don't go breakin' my heart)

[Lil Wayne (R&B Sample)]
Yeah! She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think bout leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin' my heart (Don't go breakin' my heart)

[Verse 2: Phonte]
We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens
Every mornin', and every ev-ening
Ten years later, she eatin' that Lean Cuisine
I'm on the field, straight brawn off that Creatine
In the NFL - which mean Not For Long
City to city, all the groupies they hop along
Word get back, the wifey she like, ""Stop the song""
""I'm takin' the kids to my momma's, I'm out, I'm gone!"" Whoa!
Momma was like, ""Baby now, I hate to see your tears
But I been with your daddy for bout 35 years and in my day, I had to
Turn a blind eye to cheatin'
But I ain't never had to wear no black eyes from beatings
As long as he doin' right, by you and the kids
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is?
I ain't sayin' that it's right, but we often pay the price
Cause a woman's life is love, a man's love is life
And he gon' live it to the fullest,
And I ain't tryna pull you down, or sound like a broken record
But you should know by now that all! Niggas is dogs
Better to have a rich Pit than a broke German Shepard, uh! ""

[Chorus: Phonte x2]
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin' my heart (Don't go breakin' my heart)
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin' my heart (Don't go breakin' my heart)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Word up, I say I don't have nothin' If I don't have you
Like Sade, you got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep like the first tattoo
I gets all in your head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey! Girl don't play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like the Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
Yeah! You gotta hold your soldier down
Even when the war is lookin' like, it is right around the corner
And you don't wanna leave me believe me
Cause I can turn you on like, a personal TV
It's Young Weezy, I know what you thought
But I'm just here to play my part so, don't go breakin' my heart

I'm a ri-i-der, I'm a rider
I'm too tough for y'all, and I will never fall
You can talk that talk, but I'ma walk that walk
And I'm riding, that's fa sho
I'm a surviiiii-iiii-vor, true survivor
If I walk out that do, and don't come back no mo
Let the liquor po, and let the people know
I was a rider, that's fa sho

We them niggas getting hated by haters, we them niggas that done made it outrageous
Stack the money in the streets nothing honey nothing sweet, I'm sick my chips contagious
Animals none of y'all can't cage us, got me feeling like the Heat and the Lakers
Had to switch up my team but what do ya mean, we already traded them traitors
Spend a lifetime surrounded by fakers, in the night time you high 'cause it's safer 
Spend a lifetime to grind and get paper, while all y'all crying I'm flying to Jamaica
Grinding steadily fine and cheddar he, know how to show ya the nine is deadly
Wanna be a pussy nigga fine then let it be, anybody crying that's around it's never me
Realer than the rest when it come to plex, get it off your chest if you so upset
Is that what it gon' be if it comes to yes, then I guess that day will become a mess
They messed up when they told me the sky's the limit, 
'cause I'm married to my money nigga I'm committed
If it's gold at the end of the rainbow then my gang go, get up in the vehicles and ride to get it
I'm a nigga that made it up from the bottom, I'm a always get into a lil' drama
Y'all don't know what it means to be a rider, gotta deal with anybody that got a problem
I'ma put supreme in the Impala, I'ma put some cream up in the bomber
Jack it that's it nigga go get a dollar, looking for me I'm busy my nigga holla

[Chorus]

Got the weight on my shoulder like solo flex, do the drama myself that's solo plex
I don't know what you do fo' yo checks, but my part of the do' way mo' they less
I'm gripping wood I know I'm fresh, 'cause I am that CEO and yes
The mo' I make they more upset, but I'll be damned if a nigga don't show respect
Ask the streets in the South about the kid, and they gon' tell ya I be doing my thang
We could do the beef or we could do the peace, as long as you ain't speaking my name
My partna told me you was jocking homie, and my other boy said the same
The result of that when I approached the cat, I gotta hit him with the pain like bang-bang
Physically and mentally, a rider a nigga that'll tell 'em see
I bomb on your ass it was meant to be, because I told y'all niggas not to mess with me
Do you let the beef slide, and let it die down with all your deciding
In the streets they know Cha-millionaire be riding, Batman my heat riding like Robin
Tell 'em that I got 'em if he's on my team, 'cause loyalty's something that you're gonna need
Loyalty's something others don't believe, like a ghost that most suckers ain't known to seen
But you know that a rider can notice hating, and use it to fuel all the motivation
Success is something that's fa sho to make em, back down they don't then I'm gonna break em",Rider

And everybody's ill, yeah, illegal

He figured Heaven, so he went left
Ya'll know that ain't right
Plus, he was high as a plane on that same night

Shit, I probably had that same fight
I just kept swingin
Twelfth round's comin, bells ringin

Introduced to the game, when I was just a child
Mama loved a drug dealer, straight quit her job
They took his life, and along with him, I died

Mines under the seat, by my feet, where's yours nigga?
Too much hoarse liquor, huh?
Too much pressure, too much force
Too much money, never heard that before

Cut that tail off the rat, he won't rat no more

Keep shootin, 'til I burn my sleeves
Nigga please, these boys is G's
Represent New Orleans, like a Fleur-de-lis

They know I give a fuck about them haters (nope)
Young Jizzle been gettin' paper(yeah)
Rich wheels on the coup like savors
Hit da club with 20 brawdz like flavor
I'm on da top floor(floor) no neighbors
Who you kiddin' I get my 87's tailored

Went from two ounces to a Maserati
First rap check bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt the glock 40
Get 25 a show next month I want 40
Born a real nigga but I'm a die a goon
Just bought a new choppa gon use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie I can't lose
Put me anywhere I'm the realest nigga in the room(believe me)
Take a look at me I'm what you call street approved
Got a lot haters but even more tools
I play dumb homie but never been a fool
Cut my dog off I heard he snitchin' too(ha)

[Chorus: x4]

(Ha)
Now what I look like
And if it ain't money then I don't look right
Ha ha, and that don't sound right
I swear you can get a full clip not a sound bite
Su-Wu gang and if you ain't with it then you in the food chain
I'm in that wide body I'm a need two lanes
Blue Seats white paint wetter than new rain
Like a white person with blue veins
I keep a black glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly like lu kang(ha ha)
Old player new game
I'm focused I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new Wayne
I Caress two women but ain't no two Wayne's
I don't know what you do but I do things
It's Mr. every time you see me got a new chain
My flow crazy I ain't too sane
But I am thee shit and they just poo stain

Lil Wayne,"Shit, we tryna get it for real
Oh, Rich Boy, you niggas better get focused
Get money, muthafucka, get money, muthafucka

Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police

'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home

I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back
So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap

'Lotta niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter
Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her
Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate
Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate

Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know
Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show
But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin'
Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin'

Government'd never send me a dime for school
So I went and started workin' like my nine my tool
I'm a leader for the South, pa, open ya ears
Young kids where I'm from wear permanent tears

It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

I'm a product of the block, watch the fiends come back
Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that
Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge
Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags

Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down
See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now
Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move
Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove

Pay the card for the South, yeah the hood my home
Told my mama I'ma leave the dope game alone
On my knees every night conversatin' wit God
Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard

Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies
I'm wearin' my vest in case they hit me wit the Uzi
Even if I take a trip around the world and back
I'm representin' for the hoods where they feel me at

It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto, your world, ghetto

Throw 'em up if you know what the hood like
Throw 'em up if you lookin' for that good life
Throw 'em up if ya ghetto, shit

Didn't think I was tough enough to make it on my own
But I can get through anything if I done made it through the storm

I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending
And thats all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your hear

I shed tears cause im told that they'll heal
You tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they aint comin
Way back it was hoops, now its maybach coups
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room
I'm laughin, cause its lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattooed by kartoo?
(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose

[Chorus]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top
But there is something you forgot

Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin pictures of my jewells in the light
100g's in the night, entertainin big timers
'Cause my 1 liners rude like don imus
Smellin ros on my breath, ex ? fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall ?
Got live life, tryna live life,
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

[Chorus]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying
To keep it under control
You got it down
And your well on your way to the top
(trilllllaaaaaaaaaa..ross)
But theres something you forgot

Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathem
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, im spendin em mighty daily
I know I'm under sureveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin
Im such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way im goin
Now im chowderin ?, n readin em a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
I never felt this way bout anythin in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

The bird just landed so the hood gon' rot
New whips, big chips the Prada Gucci shit
But mami your fly Benz the wide skinny lips
She takes my flight she holds my weight
While the po-po staked out from state to state
It ain't nothin' to a baller baby

Baby steppin on my line I'll show a little somethin'

Then the black crow will touch ya (touch ya)

I put this on my lord my niece was 4 when she felt chinchilla
I past the shore for that shit that made fiends rise from the dead like

At night still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreamin' kick my feet up

It's tha nigga ya Daddy hate 
Weezy F Baby, great!

I know they love me or hate me 
But I'm a G it won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me, yeah
Until you ridin to elate me
And don't wake me

And I'm dreamin' 
And me and my Lord

Lil Wayne,"I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait, check it out 

I see you, you wit him, he ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by, while he lies, then turn right round and forgive
I can't take, to see your face wit those tears running down yo cheeks
But what can I do, I gotta stay true, because deep down I'm still a G

And I don't wanna come between you and your man,
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I can't help but wait

[Chorus]
Till you get back wit him, it don't change (Can't help but wait)
Till you see that wit me, it ain't the same (Can't help but wait)
Till you, see you, for what you really are (Baby girl you are a star)
And I can't help but wait

It ain't fresh, to just let him call the shots
Your a queen, you should be, getting all that someones got
You should be rocking the latest, and purses, bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than an occasional ""I love you"", ""I'm thinking of you""

And I don't wanna come between you and your man, no
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I cant help but wait

[Chorus]

Get it together, you can do better
Seeing is believing, and I see what you need so
I'm gonna play my position, let you catch what you been missing

Never find a love like this
Oh?

We were cool back in high school
Ooh I really liked you,
Must have been your attitude.

That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind.
As the years they'll roll by,
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you.

I'm so glad you found me,
Wrap your world around me,

You're the one who saved me,
I feel like I owe you my life.
And as strange as it may seem,
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice.

You keep calling me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say,
Aren't you glad you found me,
Wrap you all around me,
Never find a love like this.

May never find a love, love, love a love like this,
That still make me think about my middle school kiss.
I sit here in this chair and I wish
For you not to leave me now.
My friends they always told me
Not to make you my wife,
Man they was putting you down.
And now they see we rolling,
Me and you, we strolling,
They don't wanna come around.

Let me hear you say,
You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,
Never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say,
Now I'll never be lonely,
Look at what you've shown me,
Never find a love like this.

When this life tries to keep us apart,
You keep calling me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say,
I'm so glad you found me,
Wrap you all around me,
Never find a love like this,

Oh never find a love like this?
When this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep calling me back to your heart,
Let me hear you say,

Somebody asked me one time
Travie, you high?
You look high

Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow
Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old
Let's have a toast, and raise our drinks
No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links

We'll do whatever you want to

You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

We'll get high, and hide
We are lovers to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We are lovers to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in

Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror 'cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?

Until I wake and see another fuckin day is relief
I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin my knees from chasing this cheese
I had point guard dreams of playin for some team
Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
Needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
But Shelly started talkin to much so she died early
They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty
Now if the bitch ain't got my dice for me then I'm sorry
But I'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap
And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask

Lil Wayne,"Yo!
Yo joint Inf' did this
This right here is crazy
I-I feel big! You-know what I'm
Not-not ""Big"" in the sense of weight,
You know like gaining weight or, nothing like that
But like colossal! you know what I mean? Like

I heard you were looking for me

(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hello!
(Tell me where you been?)
You know!
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Yeah, Ha-ha, ha I know!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hey, Hello!
(Tell me where you been?)
S***, you know!
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)

Yeah
To you
Forever, from me to you
I heard somebody said church, I'm a need a suit
I'm a need a coup
I won't need a roof
Flier than Beetle juice
Beetle juice
Beetle juice
I got the floor, I'm tryna see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof
So I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'm a leave it to
God, not Beaver
Neither
You
Cause I'm a murder, why I kill ol' and even you?
Man, I got Summer hating on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got Spring hating on me cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hating on me cause I'm colder than y'all
And I would never, I would never, I would never fall
I'm being hated on by the seasons
So f*** y'all who hating for no reason!

Who's been asking about me? In case you're wondering!
Ha!

Yeah
I been in and out the bank, b****!
While all y'all a**hole n****s been on the same s***
I flush, and watch it go down the drain quick
Two words you will never hear, ""Wayne Quit?""
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call them April Babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze,
We up!
Feet up!
Like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic
Or parallel park
In a red and yellow thing old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from Collipark
But I'm from Hollygrove!
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soowoo!"" and ""Da da dooh!""
I know my role
And I play it well
And I wear it well
On my Libra Scale
I suck a p****
F*** a p****
Leave it there

Go farther
Go further
Go harder
Is that not
Why we came? And if not,
Then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielaga's

Now my name's being mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggie's and the Pac's and the Marley's and the Marcus's
Govi
Got me
A Molotov Cocktail
Flow
Even if you box well
Can't stop the blows

The dope, boy just came off the spoon
Also

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
(Tell me where you been?)
It's gonna be on both feet
Never knees
In the dirt

You can try me f***-able, but when I squeeze it hurts
Fine
We lose two lives
Yours and mines

Lil Wayne,"Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swing
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no gown no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, I would never and ever
Fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree, I'm bright
But I don't give a fuck if you see me

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Ms. Cita pain
Now it's young money baby, keep the change
My mama say fuck em and we the same
So hello mothafucka' you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know church fit then outfit,
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this
What you bout bitch
Excuse my French emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you asking, if I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand, 
Cause you thought Lil Wayne was Weezy
But Weezy is Dwayne

[Chorus]

I was watching t.v. the other day right
Got this white guy on there 
Talking about black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see one in every hundred Americans are locked up
One in every nine black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money we spend on sending a mothafucka' to jail
A young mothafucka' to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers, 
You know crack cocaine yea stuff like that
Meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine
Police are only, I don't want to say only right, but shit
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going
But why bring a mothafucka' to jail if it's not gon' stand up in court
Cause this drug ain't that drug, 
You know level three, level four drug, shit like that
I guess it's all a misunderstanding
I sit back and think, you know us young mothafuckas you know that 1 in 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
And it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have
Why? I really don't wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood huh
You know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothafuckas, 
The real criminals
Sex offenders, rapists serial killers
Don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one them sex offenders papers
Don't trip he live right on the end of yo block,
Mhm yea, that nigga live right down the street from you,
Sex offender on the level three drug,
Convicted ex-con
Yea check em out
Watch you got, you got a daughter, son, what you got?
Ha ha yea, you know what
That's the good weed,
You know what, I have a fucking daughter
You understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail
Just because the reason why he live next door to me, 
Ain't the reason I live next door to him
Meaning he didn't rap his way to my fucking neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out bring him to jail for life
And then you move in with a sex offender
Ha ha, hey give me a paper,
Ha ha is that a misunderstanding because I didn't understand it
Another thing, let me take my glasses off
Cause I wanna see the reaction on there faces when I say this
Ha ha, this is why I don't respect you and nobody like ya
See you're the type that gets off on getting on other people
That's not good
No homo,
Rather un-human, I should say
I mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity
Rather to me is helping one another
No matter your color or race
But this guy and people like him, 
They'd rather speculate before they informate
If that's a word, ha ha ha you know spec before check
Anyways meaning id much rather
You talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one
Just my thought of good humanity 
Mr. Sharpton, hold on I ain't finished with you man
Na fuck that shit Mhm hold on, um,
Mr. sharp ton and anyone like you, you don't know me
So if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me
Are what ever I do is totally Casper the friendly ghost
To me and it doesn't make you a good person 
To criticize before you improvise
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person either 
But the characteristics for heavenly into bads way, 
Haha but since I am human I am good and bad, 
As well but I try my hardest to stay good
Threes other things I do and say may be bad or just not to good
But I do try, so with that said I don't vote you, 
I mean your only human, good or bad
But I also don't respect you and I don't care if that's good or bad
You see you are no MLK you are no Jesse Jackson, 
You are nobody, to me, your just another don king, 
With a perm, haha just a little more political, 
And that just means you're a little un-human
Then use humans, and now let me be human and say, 
Fuck Al Sharpton and anyone like him
Fuck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood
Ha ha why?,
Cause I live in the suburbs
But I come from the hood
Bring the hook in.

I'm a Millionaire,
I'm a Young Money Millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair,
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair,

Threw the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind,
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time,
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar,
And the almighty power of that cha cha cha cha chopper,
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motherfuck a copper,
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin',
Tell the coppers, ha ha ha ha you can't catch' em, you can't stop 'em,
I go by them goon rules
If you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em,
You can't man em then you mop 'em,
You can't stand em then you drop em,
You pop em cause we pop em like Orville Redenbacher

Lil Wayne,"We are at war
With the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion

But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

Some say tragedy is hard to get over
But some time that tragedy means its over, soldier
From the academy, league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove them wrong
I ain't doing nothin' but movin' on, let the truth be known
But they talk that freedom matters, and didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems problems
Who was gon' fight alone
No one's gon' save us now
How you feel, you're not alone
We're all just jealous jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome no

Tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
Tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home,
Fates not around, the lucks all gone
Don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right
And I'm a tell you whats life
And did you know?
I lost everything, but I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if I light one,
I walk a tight one
They try to tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city under water, some people still floatin'
Then they wonder why black people still voting,
Cause your presidents still chokin'
Take away the football team, the basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beatin' heart, and a wish and a prayer

These friends they come and go
But I got family family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's no way to go,
That there's no future future
Don't make this seem so low
That we can't overcome

Tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
Tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

And if you come from under the water then there's fresh air
Just breathe baby, gods got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process has so much stress
But its the progress that fills the best
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And your next, so try they can't steal your pride its inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
I know

Right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark,
We ain't tryna do nothing be at the heart
We need love, that's all now

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be
What have I done so bad, what is my destiny
You tie my hands, what am I going to see
What have I done so bad, what am I gonna be",Tie My Hands

All my guns black, I got true soul.
Yeah, and I call my coupe a black panther
(blah, blah, blah)
And that's the gat anthem.
And if a nigga play with family for that matter,
I'm a smoke so many niggas I'm a catch cancer,
Yeah and if I step up out this benz-o, 
You know I'm comin' with a gun like a Nintendo, 
They soft, them niggas fallin' when the wind blow, 
When I'm rollin' up my window.
Fuck 'em!

Came in the game as a youngin', 
Sign with Cash Money, 
Pocket full of money.
Niggas poppin' shit 
Always talkin' bout somethin'.
See ya' ass in public 
It's a whole 'nother subject.
(Man they just) talking bout it
They just talking bout it
And I'm on the streets with it 
And I'm on the streets with it
See where I come from, 
You gotta be about it.
And if you want it (want it) 
We come and see about it.",Talkin' About It
Lil Wayne,"Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swing
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no gown no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, I would never and ever
F***ing fantastic, f*** if you agree, I'm bright
But I don't give a f*** if you see me

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Ms. Cita pain
Now it's young money baby, keep the change
My mama say f*** em and we the same
So hello mothaf***a' you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know church fit then outfit,
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this
What you bout b****
Excuse my French emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you asking, if I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand, 
Cause you thought Lil Wayne was Weezy
But Weezy is Dwayne

[Chorus]

I was watching t.v. the other day right
Got this white guy on there 
Talking about black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see one in every hundred Americans are locked up
One in every nine black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money we spend on sending a mothaf***a' to jail
A young mothaf***a' to jail
Would be less to send his or her young a** to college
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers, 
You know crack cocaine stuff like that
Meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine
Police are only, I don't want to say only right, but s***
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going
But why bring a mothaf***a' to jail if it's not gon' stand up in court
Cause this drug ain't that drug, 
You know level 3, level 4 drug, s*** like that
I guess it's all a misunderstanding
I sit back and think, you know us young mothaf***as you know that 1 in 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
And it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have
Why? I really don't wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood huh
You know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothaf***as, 
The real criminals
Sex offenders, rapists serial killers
Don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one them sex offenders papers
Don't trip he live right on the end of yo block,
Mhm yea, that n**** live right down the street from you,
Sex offender on the level three drug,
Convicted ex-con
Yea check em out
Watch you got, you got a daughter, son, what you got?
Ha ha yea, you know what
That's the good weed,
You know what, I have a f***ing daughter
You understand me and why the f*** would you bring my neighbor to jail
Just because the reason why he live next door to me, 
Ain't the reason I live next door to him
Meaning he didn't rap his way to my f***ing neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out bring him to jail for life
And then you move in with a sex offender
Ha ha, hey give me a paper,
Ha ha is that a misunderstanding because I didn't understand it
Another thing, let me take my glasses off
Cause I wanna see the reaction on there faces when I say this
Ha ha, this is why I don't respect you and nobody like ya
See you're the type that gets off on getting on other people
That's not good
No homo,
Rather un-human, I should say
I mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity
Rather to me is helping one another
No matter your color or race
But this guy and people like him, 
They'd rather speculate before they informate
If that's a word, ha ha ha you know spec before check
Anyways meaning id much rather
You talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one
Just my thought of good humanity 
Mr. Sharpton, hold on I ain't finished with you man
Na f*** that s*** hm hold on, um,
Mr. sharp ton and anyone like you, you don't know me
So if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me
Are what ever I do is totally Casper the friendly ghost
To me and it doesn't make you a good person 
To criticize before you improvise
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person either 
But the characteristics for heavenly into bads way, 
Ha ha but since I am human I am good and bad, 
As well but I try my hardest to stay good
Threes other things I do and say may be bad or just not to good
But I do try, so with that said I don't vote you, 
I mean your only human, good or bad
But I also don't respect you and I don't care if that's good or bad
You see you are no M-L-K you are no Jesse Jackson, 
You are nobody, to me, your just another don king, 
With a perm, ha ha just a little more political, 
And that just means you're a little un-human
Then use humans, and now let me be human and say, 
F*** Al Sharpton and anyone like him
F*** if you understand me
I love being misunderstood
Ha ha why?,
Cause I live in the suburbs
But I come from the hood
Bring the hook in.

Lil Wayne,"And I don't walk around looking for it, you know?, 
But yesterday It Seemed to just wander on till it found me,
The gossip found me
Then why don't you just prove it
How? You don't know how to prove it?,
Well, what you just do is

Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop (Oh)
Stop, hatin' on a n****
That is a weak emotion
The lady of a n****
And you could get tipped
Like ya waitin' on a n****, and
Put a body bag and an apron on tha n****

I give my all behind the mic,
But you could never see, if you sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me, to win the title fight
But I'm gone wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is no white
I'm tryna be polite, 
But you b****es in my hair like the f***ing Po-lice

These other rappers bark,
Some of em' even bite

Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the booth and
Soo-woop

Sorry there's a tub in the boot, now where the drugs at?
Like the string of the shoe
No n**** f*** that
I'm twisted like the string on a boot, where New Orleans at?
I build hip hop solely like a bus pa**
So in your possession, I must ask

Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem,
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry,
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gone need cheese if I'm bakin' a ziti
You n****s want beef?
I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where we be
Hard body n****, takin' it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like Eazy

Lil Wayne,"See when I got Mercedes money I went and got a Mercedes
When I got that Bentley money I went and got that Bentley
Now if you ain't help me get it don't tell me how to spend it
And yes I know the rules, never marry Robin Givens
Mozzarella over bitches
So we call me them bitches cheese heads
Lambo leap in that pussy like them green bay
Lambo sweet look like sugar on the freeway
And I'm riding dirty cause I'm so UGK
One, two, three way four an' four makes eight
Nine times outta' ten its an eleven or a twelve gauge
Friday the 13th that's the day that hell raised
But y'all boys too weak like fourteen days
I'm so clean why wouldn't I be
I be with Ben Frank so much he startin' to look like me
I'm a smoke my weed cause I don't wanna smoke yours
And I pour four every time I pour
Like, was you saying something bitch
If you talkin' bout us then you ain't talkin' bout shit!

I wake up this mornin' eyes half closed
And looked in the mirror and say damn I'm cold
Damn I'm cold and my hoes
Pimp shit nigga keep payin' my hoes
Damn I'm cold man I'm cold
I say damn I'm cold
Hot damn I'm cold

When I got that slab money I put the Remy on blades
When I got that lac money
I candied the Escalade
Gotta screw on my deck
A house or two on my neck
A couple cars on my wrist
And bitch I'm ready to wreck
We bout to this for Pimp C
So pass me a bottle
I'm bout to pop the top on em
Like a slab or a model
Turn it upside down
And pour it out for my lil' bro
And pass me another one so I can pour out a little mo'
Fresher than osmium
Cleaner than wax floors
I'm slick as aluminum
Swingin' my lac doors
The Franklin's you foldin' them
We tryin' to stack those
Before you play the role
You gotta learn how to act, hoes!
Swingers and crank foes
And tippin' trunks of pain
Hangers give neck and hoes
And flip with nuts and hang
It ain't a thang
It never was and never will
I put that on my life
Bun B forever trill

Fuck you right all right
Going at your neck like a fuckin' dog bites
I woke up this morning eyes half closed
Looked into the mirror and said damn I'm cold
Damn I'm cold and my hoe
Pimp shit nigga keep paying my hoe
Damn I'm cold man I'm throwed
I said damn I'm cold, hot damn I'm cold

Is it the ice in the piece or the ice in the chains?
Is it the ice in the watch or the ice in the rings?
Or the bracelet, face you feel the chill in yo veins
Could it be from Bun B or that boy Lil' Wayne

Or could it be the two-seater on them thangs
Got on a couple gold chains so dang it dang
I swang a thang, from lane to lane
Yeah, its getting hot and you starting to feel the flame
Bun

It's getting brick and you starting to feel a breeze
And the temperature's going down
Best'a get you some sleeves
And you best'a get you some G's
Fore you lose your control
And we turn your whole neighborhood into the north pole

Like brr
Machine gun brr
I am a beast grr
Money machine brr
F-U-C-K C-O-P's
I say I know when they say freeze
Yeah!

Ok you already knew
No pussies, no rats, no Tom and Jerry show
And I woke up this morning eyes half closed
Looked into the mirror like damn I'm cold
Damn I'm cold and my hoe
Damn I'm cold, man I'm cold
I say damn I'm cold
Hot damn I'm cold",Damn I'm Cold

Lil Wayne,"Where's my coffee?
Good morning doctor carter (hey sweetie)
Looks like its going to be a long day. (another one what we got?)
Your first patient (yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)
Originality (ugh)
His flow is weak (another one)
And he has no style (ugh)
What'cha got for um?

OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.
Dr.carter to the rescue.
Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break.
Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture what I say.
All I need is one mic.
All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gun-play like.
No kidding, no kids in the way,
But the kids do watch.
Gotta watch what we say.
Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait
Think I think I lost 'em

Good afternoon doctor carter
Nurse
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down
Vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lost respect for the game
Ah let me see
Think you can save him?

OK.
Respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'm a start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
Now hey kid
Plural I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Arthritis in my hand from writing.
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lighting.
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.
Fast and exciting.
My passion is frighting.
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.
Here take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit
God damn it I've lost another one

Good evening doctor carter its been a long day
But this one looks much better then the others
His respect is back up
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is some swagger
OK let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.
Fly go hard like geese erection.
Fashion patrol police detection.
I stay tight like Chinese connection.
I stay tight like pussy at night.
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right.
But I'm too wrong to write.
Too fresh to fight.
Too paid to freestyle.
Too paid to freestyle.
I had to say it twice
Swagger so nice.
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price.
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.
I can only see flow.
His blood starting to flow.
His lungs starting to grow.
This one starting to show.
Strong signs of life.
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.

He looks good
His vitals are up
He's looking good

Lil Wayne,"I loved her fancy underwear
I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get
To tell her I'm the one she should be with
She's popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eye
I could see her in my life
She would've had the perfect sweet man
But
See she had other plans
I could not understand
Her and her stupid friends
Varsity's biggest fans

Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all
She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen the prom queen
Is crying sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything could turn around

They loved her fancy underwear
Every boyfriend every year
She tried to keep 'em entertained
When they can hardly remember her name
She did everything she could just to
To make him love and treat her good
She found herself alone
Askin' herself where did she go wrong
She didn't realize
She chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties
Tryin' to apologize

Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all
She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part

And if you tryna zone I got a whole swisha sweet full
Rappers are liars and they women are deceitful
Adding till they subtract me I never be a equal

Then he got it for me and I'm happy as can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off ofa rebound

Hate when rappers say they tryna get they swagger right
Cause I done came wit mo' fire than a dragon fight

Oops I mean a red clue

I did it all on my own, 
Turned a chair to a throne, 
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known, 
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere, 
If I ever disappear, 
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again, 
All I ever do is, 
(Stunt hard)

(Drake):
I tell her.
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy. 
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who Is He"", 
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy. 
And I'm focused on my survival. 
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival. 
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idols.
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.
I'm everything you just haven't become.
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.
Now hopefully let them see, 
What they say that I'm gon' be, 
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me. 
Get your team in order, assembly is key. 
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea. 
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty. 
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.
But I'm just trying to swerve. 
Without hitting the curb. 
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them. 
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them. 
I am not them. I Photoshop them, out.
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about. 
Yeah. 
The Chris Paul 
Of this fall,
Sittin' this tall.
I float high, 
Goodbye, 
I will miss y'all.

[Chorus]

(Lil' Wayne):
If I don't do nothin', Imma stunt my ass off.
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff. 
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off. 
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff. 
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stunt devil. 
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.
I'm a young rebel. 
And I got a baby face. 
I need a young pebbles. 
I need a stuntdouble. 
Yeah! 
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble. 
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles. 
Yeah! 
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers. 
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes. 
Yeah! 
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes 
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O. 
Yeah! 
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious. 
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious. 
Yeah! 
I'm on the cup of that tilt. 
And if you hatin' on me 
I'll say fuck you like wilt. 
Yeah! 
I'm a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast. 
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace. 
Yeah! 
Talkin' big big shit. 
I am rude,
I take food,
From a kid picnic.
Nigga. 
Yeah!
And we can bang like bumper cars. 
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all stunner bars.
Haha.

[Chorus]

(Nutt Da Kid):
I stunt hard. I stunt harder.
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans.
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger.
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter. 
I hustle harder. 
I live in the Carter. 
I think forward,
All I see is tomorrow. 
I need me. 
I'll turn your shop into a horror. 
So if you trying to see more 
Better feed me. 
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger. 
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur. 
And the feds will never get me, 
Like a backwards, 
Password, 
Black spur, 
Go some like Pacman, cats first. 
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister
Ask her, 
Am I their man,
Her answer, 
Is yes sir. 
Shit. 
I'm tourin' states on stage, 
I played the RTA 
'Bout a quarter a day. 
Now tell them bitches.

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my s*** Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two b****es at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the b****, but I f*** her like I missed her
Life is the b****, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, we're a f***in' family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, f*** segregation
F*** that s***, my money up, you n****s just Honey Nut
Young Money running s*** and you n****s just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doing this s***
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

I'm going back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these n****s like sequins
N****s think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, f*** the world, that's adultery
You full of s***, you close your mouth and let yo a** talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, b****, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I f*** around and cut my head off
Real n**** all day and tomorrow
But these mu'f***ers talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
B****, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these n****s animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em b****es I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
B****, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You n****s are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my a**, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, guess I'm Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, b****, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you n****s that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you n****s the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
B****, I flow like scuba, b****, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
N****s think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, b****, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these n****s out they mind
I done told these f*** n****s, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I f*** these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, gonna need a little luck
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, b****
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a B.X. n****, ya heard?

Lil Wayne,"This song right here, 
Is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, 
Lost city of New Orleans, we call him this

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy

That was President Johnson but now
But it's president (Georgia) Bush

[Repeat: x2]
We from a town where (Georgia)

Everybody crying but (Georgia)
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

Now
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es

And she get mad when I call other woman hoes
You send a rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear, than lick around her lobe
And when she check her watch, it's never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came, she caught me like the common cold.

Knock knock let us up, young money applaud me
And we'll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

I'mma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn't given
Everything that I've given, I swear I'll never give in

Just look at what I've been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me,
'Cause young money is the Navy better yet the Army

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Than do it for the troops
It's young money salute
It's young money salute

Commander in chief
One hand on the World, one hand on the brief

Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don't ask me about shit but money
Fuckin' right my money long I got that 10ft money

I'm a purple heart proven war vet rookie
You can't even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don't step to me
Now don't step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain't we God's children
I know at all times God's feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me
Salute or shoot!

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Than do it for the troops
It's young money salute

I will try you, I wouldn't lie dude
I must be sticky 'cause them bitches got their eyes glued
Young money baby we the shit like fly food
Y'all cant see us like the bride shoes.
I stand tall like a muthafuckin 9'2
I scream motherfuck you and whoever design you
And if you think you hot then obviously you are lied to
And we don't die, we multiply and then we come divide you.

I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of ya time I wont waste it
I got my foot on the line I'm not racin'
I thank god that I am not basic
I am not basic
I am not a human being

Re-Reporting from another world
Magazine full of bullets you can be my cover girl
Bless go the weed thicker than a southern girl
Strong arm rap like a nigga did a hundred curls
Rock star biatch, check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip hop it must be knee hop
I'm higher than a tree top
She lick my lo-llipop
I still get my candy from your girlfriends sweet shop
Spitting that he rock im smooth not Pete Rock
And my money on etcetera three dots
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops
You better run mothafucka, 'cause we not
You better run till your feet stop
You ain't even on a fucking alphabet in my tea pot
Colder than a ski shop
Holding on to the top, and even if I let go I still wont G-rock

I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of ya time I wont waste it
I got my foot on the line I'm not racin'
I thank God that I am not basic
I am not basic
I am not a human being",I Am Not a Human Being [Version]

Lil Wayne,"Ayo, it’s Weezy muthafuckin', easy with the hating
Bitch, I’m in the building; you just decorating
I’m just detonating, then I get blatant
More dangerous than Internet dating
Scoob got the cameras on so I got to show off
I put your sister on, I knock your bro off
Weezy just spit snowballs: catch it in your face, bitch
Good game, Wayne; mane, I deserve a Naismith
Cook caine game flow: dope-in-the-vein flow
I’ll only be smoking the purple out the rainbow
Stronger than Drano, your boyfriend a lame-o
And if you stay with him, then y’all in the same boat
Deepwater Carter, fishing for a dollar
You can join the salad I’m splitting your tomata
Ball cause I gotta, you’ll love me in the morning
I told her I'm a king, them other niggas Prince Charming
She love to rock the mic, she say there's nothing like performing
Man I'm in love with her grill: George Foreman
Forewarning: Young Money’s on, and we can shoot it out
I got the money drawn; yeah, take that to the bank with ya
I rock my hat to the side like I paint pictures
Smoke weed, talk shit like Lane Kiffin
Whole country in recession, but Wayne different
And I’m a Maybach rider, haven’t drove it one time
I got a cool black driver, can't walk around with guns
I got a dude that got 'em; don’t worry if I'm shootin
As long as you get shot; I'm a beast, I'm a pitbull
I get my ass kissed, I get my dick pulled
I'm a beast, I'm a big bull
I got my money right, I got my clip full

I’m up for whoever the opponent, nigga
Stop the track, let me relish in the moment, nigga
Now bring that motherfucker back, cause I’m zoning, nigga
I go hard like Rafael Nadal
And if the bitches were a habit, I bet we have them all
And man, I'm so high it's like an ever-lasting fall
And I’m charging these hoes like women's basketball
I bet that chopper get his mind right
Leave a hole in his chest like a lion bite
Super hero car like I crime fight
I see big cheese, you niggas blind mice
T-Streets still roll with me
Still sticking to the script like Nicole Kidman
Need the man hit? We are those hitmen
He stopped running, the bullet holes didn’t
Basically, I’m still a monster
Till the fat lady sings I come to kill the Opera
Y'all too plain: I'm a helicopter
My words keep going like a teleprompter
I’m a asshole: wipe me down, bitch
I get big checks: Nike Town, bitch
Yeah, mean mug, Bobby Brown shit
And the flag red like clown lips, T., I can't stop goin' in

Dropping babys out and your chicks cheek, kicks neat,

Leave em with a pale face,
Yes, I am a young money goon,
Your girl like a motion picture she gon be coming soon,
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons,
I pass her off to Mills then drop her off the tune,
Couple screws lose, you wanna play with him,
This is No Ceilings b-tch, roofless like a stadium,
We shut down every f-cking spot these b-tches see us in,
You want us in your club well n-gga pay us then,

More than an artist bitch,

And walk around like she President Carters bitch,

And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true 
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying 
I'm just here making all the music that they party to

I got these new rappers nervous prom night n**** 
I've grown tired of these f***ing grown man liars

Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot 
This s*** feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park 
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose 
Yeah, but I'm a ma'f***in' missed target 
But a target nonetheless and I just started 
Was that directed at moi? Can't be

Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner

Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you, 
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you

The summer's ours, the winter too 
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do 
And to these n****s I'm like Windows 7 
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you 
And since no good deed go unpunished 
I'm not as cool with n****s as I once was 
I once was, cool as The Fonz was 
But these bright lights turned me to a monster 
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me 
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me 
F*** n****s, b****es too 
All I got is this money, this'll do 

Who would have thought 
I'd be caught in this life?

Lil Wayne,"I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a n****
But soon for a n**** it be on, mu'f***a'
Cause all the bulls***, just made me strong, mu'f***a'

So I pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
B****, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth Motherf***er
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, Motherf***er
I'm gone
Motherf***er, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on yo f***in' head, ha ha
B****, I'm a pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth Motherf***er
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, Motherf***er
I'm gone
Motherf***er, I'm gone (I'm gone)

It hurts, but I never show,
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""f*** 'em all""

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that f***in' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-F***ed this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
F*** this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these f***in' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your f***in' heads better nod
Or I'm a F*** around in this B**** and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, B****, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible
Hulk, you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your f***in' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce and olives
I'll f***in'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
B****, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head
And I could die now, rebirth Motherf***er
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, Motherf***er

Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handling since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it and told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but no bitches
Watch how I'm walking cause even the thoroughest niggas be narc'in
Tryin' to strike a bargain hoping that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch ya
Freeze off my knee cap, can y'all believe that?
Got the city drinking Cristals, re-up the fee

Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle

'Bout to start bitching ain't you? Ready to start snitching ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak ass; hustling just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honeys that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of mac-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers

Stopped at the station, filled up on octane

When you was just a youngin', your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you, can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening

But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'

Verse 1:
Dear Anne
My number 1 fan
I write with the light from the lamp on my nightstand
With my pen in my right hand
And that's also my mic hand
Codeine in the sprite can
Ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne
And wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right
And sometimes I might
Ca-can I find the light?
Still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan
And I'm sure (shore) like white sand
That they'll be price payin'
Before my flight land
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
Adore, so I can't ignore
What I want anymore
So I just go, you can call me the Gore
And oh yeah
I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And um, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
And yeh, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore

I write you this letter
I hope everything's grand
I hope everyone's good
I hope everybody's praying

I hope ? hold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit and
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And every time I look there's a problem with this man
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
And I'm tryna stay up out them chick's pants
(Laughs) but, I just can't
But, on another note, this ain't just another note
This is more than a rap
This is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
And I'm just hoping that you read this far

By now you probably think I'm portraying who I'm sayin
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him, but I am
And it's people like you that make me part of what I am
But hey, you are the shit
Damn, pardon the gram (grammar)
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
And shit, when my life be like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there- lions, horses and rams
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to began
I just think of you, then I'm rewarded again
And, with you, is where my artistry can
And, so with you is where a part of me stands
And, I hope I see you in the stands
Anne, because you know I understand
And, and I'm sorry about Stan
So I wrote this to say I'm your number 1 fan.

And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
and get what you need without saying please
But can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they put this man’s Grammy’s on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happened in a Hyatt?
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker, you think I don’t remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don’t even know got you in bed
Betcha buddy don't even know you don’t like red
Or was it fuchsia, fuck it, Our future is dead.

Peace to my man 'Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin' switches to the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it, nah forget it, soo woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don't live in Judah's eyes
Half of these rappers weren't trappin' when I was choppin' the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma ""won't you decide""
She chose Doc, first day I pulled Jude aside like its Aftermath for life
And all I do is ride
Before I turn on him I kill Satan
And stick my red flag in the ground it's red nation!

Now blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what

Lookin' in the mirror, I'm no where to be found

Pimp, hoes and gamblers
Ninety eight degree's on Christmas

Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I'm Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panites down, stain it
That's my Chi-lingo, yeah I'm bi-lingual
Ball by myself nigga Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God

Now blood the fuck up

Walk in the club saggin' with a thirty eight magnum

Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at?
Roll up the weed son, so many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I'm out here, I might as well go shopping

Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy getting problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)

God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get high-ya!, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight
I'm a Southern delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
Ever today that I took a walk outside

I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy getting problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)

Ugh, and we all kiss our mommas
Cause promises are broken, but tomorrow isn't a promise
Think I'm getting sick, I'm feelin' ill-egal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget so try to live it up
It's Doctor Carter bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they'd probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper, before they start the fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call yo block
Call Mitchell Carmone, now my pockets all bumped
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker I don't shoot you, bitch I shoot ya up
I ain't ride with these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint, white spike with these niggas
When I woke up this morning, got the cold out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside

And I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high I can't see you from here

When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mids

Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my god son just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn

Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine

I ain't trippin', but she be trippin'
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffin'
Look girl, just gimmie that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'mma dog, but how come I don't chase 'em
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say ""okay I'm ya honor""
But she been wantin' to break up, since dolce and gabbana
All that ass I just be like come sit yo groceries on my counter

My little breed, yea

Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity

I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch?
I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshner

Damn, military minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was looking for me, I'ma hide by abroad
Shootin' stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I'm wired off a socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
My little breed, yea

Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshner
I don't play boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of commands, I'm the missing link

I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid
For them dead presidents we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work, so I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get get murked
And my pants saggin like fuck it, I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green
Mane my niggas got them birds, you ain't even got bird seeds
Your bitch ride me like a go kart, I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after that they worthless

Man, I swear to God I ain't nervous

I like em long haired and curvy
And if niggas think its a game, I'll leave their brains on their jerseys

She say she love me, that's the molly talking
She about to blow me, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch
I'm an original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money's Obama
Its fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence

But I swear to God he heard it!
Yea, and I swear to God I ain't nervous
Na, I swear to God I ain't nervous
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service
She gone ride this dick like the Kentucky-Derby

On that Patron, I'm swerving

Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeno
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tape worm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big headed my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes

Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough

It's not doggy style, I call it froggystyle
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it
Everything authentic, plus I named my pistols
Last name Fuck, first name I Don't Give A
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start dippin' you know the procedure

You leave your home for days and days

All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missile
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you

Lil Wayne,"I'm so sorry, so sorry
This, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2, and I'm so sorry

Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga, Glock 40 for them fake niggas
Throw a party everyday, nigga, that's an ordinary day, nigga
Bad bitch in mi casa, no mi casa su casa
My choppa go doom dada thayahyahyahda

Tunechi, bitch, on my Future shit, I'm too legit
I sleep on a crucifix
I wake up cranky and turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch behind orange juice and grits
Uzi clip, I need another uzi clip, I shoot to kill
These pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real, your head just a souvenir
She wanna get it off her chest, but her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter 5 on a iPod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said soon as these niggas hear your new shit
They gon' have to give they styles back
I said ""you too cray"", she said ""you too humble""
I said ""you too, bae"", she said ""you too sweet""
Then I asked her do she go both ways
She say ""they do say love is a two way street""
I said ""oooh"", talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine, she gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum, I'm gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt, never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
Sell birds to the bees, I sell birds to the trees
Tune, I heard you don't sleep, I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk, but I tweak for that purple, that pink
Yeah, you see what I'm saying like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease, I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats, I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with, she working for me
I personally get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers, I'm at peace; word
I smirk when I squeeze, trigga smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek, I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time in Cash Money, time served and released
But this agent ain't free, word, that's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news, that shit is so yesterweek
I'm just focused, focused on my expertise
They like ""Tunechi, you good?"" I'm like ""Bob, yessiree!""
Now don't, I mean don't, don't question me, let me breathe
Dog, big dog, I cock back and shoot at ya fleas
Money long; tree trunk, now stand under me, catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees, but repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch; your bitch Tunechi bitch
I fuck her on my balcony, we watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit, she gonna need lube for this
'Cause' I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world, she like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant, she doing lines like a movie script But these are true events, lord
I'll kill a nigga right now, I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box with holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than, these niggas softer then nylon
So keep my name out your mouth, I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fucking self, you only live twice slime
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me, these niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline, but they never try mine
Spittin' like I'm sipping cyanide while my bitch sip a mai tai
But she wine fine
And I'm so sorry, she say ""don't be sorry""
Woo!
Then she said ""don't apologize for shit
'Cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter 5 the shit, woah""

These niggas listenin', use Morse code
Boy a nigga sippin' like parched throat
Excuse me
These niggas talkin' that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feelin' on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast die young and leave a beautiful corpse, yes Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks, I sent five bricks with four chicks
Ridin' with these guns that's carpoolin', bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow white we snowed in, nigga miss me with that whole shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that, and watch everybody I toast with
Kill everybody you close with, Just don’t stick your nose in
My bullshit cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live, you tell that nigga I owe him
Yeah, I got my mind right, and my money right, my head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a lil' blurry but it stand on my quota

Tell me something I don’t know, I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money, drugs, bitches, guns, niggas call me mucho
Got witches all in my broom closet, got little killers in Chuco
We’ll find out your business hours and pop up like new toast
Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes, kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
A.K to your face, knock half off like coupons
Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys
Tell the cops we don’t name drop that's like dropping newborns
Nigga you crazy

You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me
Nigga tell me somethin' I don't know

Like where the fuck did my heart go, and show me something I haven’t seen
And give me what help Martin sleep, on the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been, but not to where I’ll never be
And I ain’t never scared but I’m scared of me, me versus me I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputies big letter B, need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine

You so Krazy, Tunechi
You so Krazy, bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
You so Krazy, bitch

Tell me something I don’t know, like what happened to hard coke
You can call me Eddy cause I stay ready, my family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion with the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage
I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads with some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge, psychopathic, so psychopathic
Nigga give me credit, on my balance

Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said ""Whatever"" cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up

I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and find light
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight
Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out
When I met her she was posse'd up
In the section holding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be popular
Oh, she just wanted ten thousand followers

I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But you, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

I'm facing the bottle

For all of my problems (I'm too open)

Lil Wyte,"Go on and slip me two Xanax Bars - I'm ready to git fool
5th to Crown to wash it down, I'm downtown snapping rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game - in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxycontin in my system - man I'm feeling kinda strange
Watch me choke about this dope - Blueberry from Texas
She want to git up in rotation that's too bad cause I'm stressing
'Bout now its 1:30 am - 11 Percocets just entered me
15 minutes from this second - I'll be crawling on my knees
Laughing at the crowd of all the clowns that be surrounding me
Take another Lortab to call me down and let me see
Body be relaxed - muscles be loose, and you have stopped the pain
No more bitching 'bout your day and work and driving in the rain
Put up wit' the fussing and discussion - I plant in your brain
Hypnotize ya minds, like all the rest but I come through the veins
Take a chill pill to slow me down and git back in this game
Gatta be up on ya P's and Q's to even feel it mane

Oxycontin - Xanax Bars - Percocet and Lortab
Valiums - Morphine - patches - Exctacy - and it's all up for grab

Scarecrow, scarecrow what's that you popping?
A powerful pill they call Oxycontin
But it'so tiny, that it catch you dragging
Haven't you heard big things come in small packages
I prefer the orange's with the black O-see
Take to where you can - I move about you see
Some people mellow down in a needle and shoot 'em up
Buy I pop 'em with Seroquel like glue, I am stuck

See I'ma pill popper - so I'ma keep poppin' em
Gimme 20 Xanax and I'ma start droppin' em
They ain't no stoppin' him - when they in my system
Mane I really miss 'em - can you help me get 'em
I heard you have Clidina, on that fucking pill shed
Gimme some fuckn Ec' - gimme some Percocets
I need me some four bar, so I can break down
Cause a nigga like me 'finna take it to funky town

[Verse 1]
I'm 5 foot 8, from the Bay, white as fuck and do not play
If you want me, come and get me, Fraiser Drive is where I stay
Won't you come on down my way, I hope that you ain't afraid
You won't even need the numbers 'cause we posted every day
On the corner or in my front yard where we smoke marijuana
Sit back, wait on the police to ride by and stash so we can dog'em
Know wha I'm sayin, they can't fade us, so what the fuck you think you gon do?
We HCP, clicked up with the rest of the world and yes we deep foo
You don't want to end up an example of what we would to to haters mayne
Victimz have said that we bring the pain and witnesses that we all insane
I don't want to stress all of tha shit that y'all been constantly questionin
Shit that I'm preachin come from people teachin
The shit that I remember so deep within
And when I get to where I'm gonna be in my successful life
I'ma look down at y'all haters in disgrace 'cause I done took my flight
And when I get in that shining stage of my life
I'ma make sure all y'all haters remember me and I'm gon allright

[Chorus]
So many haters in this world they want to see us fall
We have no love for none of you bustaz, I said none of y'all
I know you see me everyday, I'm posted on the wall
I'm gonna continue to mash and always standin ten toes tall
So many haters in this world they want to see us fall
We have no love for none of you bustaz, I said none of y'all
I know you see me everyday, I'm posted on the wall
We gonna continue to mash and always standin ten toes tall

[Verse 2]
Keep'em breathin, leave'em bleedin, boy this is not haters season
This the reason for them beefin, all the rest is just some treason
I got nina's, I got rifles, I got fully auto's too
You get one I will get five and everyone will come for you
This the truth, I got problems in my life and that'z a fact
But that don't give you one right to jump in my shit and holla back
With a different brain, simple thangs, keep me on a different plane
Bizness mayne, with pleasure to settle by an open flame
Plenty change will be accepted, but plus I want the fame
Know my name and disrespect it but it will stay the same
Down the drain, knowin for me I have to be workin thangz
Love the game, want to retire but when I'm 80 mayne
Mary Jane all in my system but yet I still maintain
I'm insane, so hard to hide it but still I can't complain
I got killaz takin good care of ya, leavin plenty stainz
With the shovel I'm gonna bary yo mangled up remainz

Talk about these hatin lil boys, carryin they toys but they small dawg
Put yo 22 under my 5-0 cal and I'ma get rawed dawg
Ain't no need to stall dawg, I'ma blow up on all y'all
Racin across the nation to yo crib, I bought my sign y'all
Now we about to stop, now the road about 2 blockz
Reachin yo house wit two glockz, got in yo house wit 2 knockz
Came to the door in Reebok's, joggin pants wit no sockz
Run up them steps actin like you won't get caught but break them door lockz
Situations gettin mixed,yo messenger boy got in some shit
Crossed the wrong one, he found out he didn't know who he was fuckin wit

In a nut shell don't fuck wit this
Fraiser,bound lil youngsta, *Hyptonized* is how I'll leave ya bitch
Blastin back wit competition, stainin on y'all fuckin hoez
Leavin incisions I'm pimpin righ up out the do'

Lil Wyte,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter",Acid 2004/5

Lil Wyte,"Start this night out right so i don't fall on my face
I got some red necks wit me ready to get drunk and shot da gauge
They got 6 shots of tequila and half a bottle of bacardi
The bottle came from someones cooler when we left the bonfire party
They constantly askin fo mo and tryin to pour me up a shot
Incredible hulk mixed wit vodka and a skotch on the rocks
Crown royal wit coke a bud light my eye balls afloat
So much fuckin liquid in me i got to hit da pisser fo sho
Keepin up wit hill billys actin silly drunker then shit
This might compare to my smokin song but pimpin this is not it
This is my drinkin song so you know wut you got to do
Drink twelve or twenty one or wut eva you do but don't stop at two

[Chorus x2]
This is my drinkin song
And there ain't no rules wut you waitin on
Pop a bottle pour your self a shot or even brew your own
If your goin to drink might as well drink until you hit the floor
Afta you hit the floor get yo ass up and pour a couple mo

Aight I'm alright listen to my words I have dranken up half the bar
And still yet a swurl I heard
I looked down at red neck he look like he was about to hurl
Brother robby actin similar but was spinnin like the world
Now real rednecks can get drunk like some shit I've neva seen
Ten shots bud lights fo chasin and ready for round eleventeen
Demolition derbys at the races rodeos and hill streets
When ever legal liqour sold white folks will meet
But we all want to get fucked up and when i say we
I'm talkin about every nationality on this g.l.o.b.e
And some do, some don't, some might like it, some won't,
I'll tell you wut i love this so much I'm fucked up right now

We jump in slappa's car don't worry this fool wasn't driven
The outcome would of been ridiculous and we wouldn't of survived
Believe it or not i was the most sober of the five of us
Liquor in me got to piss again i feel like I'm bout to bust
Good thing we got out the exit fo me to handle my business
I jumped out to drain my lizard and god as my witness
I see a truck load of moonshine hideing behind some trees
Wit the keys in it and nobody around
No one but me this mean we can get drunker and crunker
And make us some cheese from mariana arkansas
Through the woods back to tennessee
This event start anotha good ol'boy fraiser drinkin day
In the back of a chevelle pick up shootin of this daze

Even at 75, I'll still be able to work my magic

50 Billion but I will settle for 2 point 4
Check the scans, I'm the man in this independent land
No video no single record companies like I be damned
This Wyte cat can rap and put on a good show

Give my props to my mom
Give my props to the Camp, give my props to the South
Now I'm drunk and I'm high but I bet you already knew it
You fuck as me, you fuck as us and we twice and fuck as you
Security started movin through the middle of the crowd
Only if he got a gun, will I agree to shut him down
Cause I ain't tryin to get shot by no mothafuckin fuck
A nerd by day done had to many drinks and all a sudden crunk
Pick me up, let me out, blow me up and fuck me loud
So many styles be comin up outta me whenever I'm in the crowd
I have a high pace game face eyeballs up in outer space
Keep up with the shit, tryin to stay away
What you think, only cracka good enough to be down the 6
Clearly understood that this some orignal gangsta shit

[echoing] GOD [echoing] man it sound like I hear someone screaming [echoing]
what the fuck [echoing] man I'm sooo fucked up, God I promise let me live
tonite [echoing] man I will never get high again

[Lil Wyte]
I'm slummed out right now, that ain't no surprise
Dilated pupils seein doubles out of both my eyes
I hit up a little spark, got 'em for no charge, and fuck with his boy
Zanex bars call 'em totem poles or even tonka toys
I popped half and then popped the other half and hit the crown
Then put my shot glass down and poured another round
I'm starting to fill everything I just put into my body
Liquor and the bars got me right though I might look retarded
Get up out my way little quicka with the K
Even though I'm fucked up I'ma still maintain
Got sumthin in my brain like do damn thang
Like tell the same mayne's ass soft insane
I'ma monsta when I'm high specially on some bars
Don't need to cop lyrically can catch a charge
Runnin down the street yellin fuck the police
With Reeboxs on my feet high on 4 more bars
I'ma hold my crown and I'ma rep my Memphis pop my pills, smoke all my deeros
Be fucked up fall out in public fallin out on crackers and negros
Ho you think you know Lil Wyte I'm telling you rightcha now
You hold out I'ma find out better pull 'em out and pass them sticks around

[Chorus]
Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you

[Lil Wyte]
One little pill you can break down into fo's
Guaranteed when mixed with liquor it gone have on the flo'
Take advantage of the power the sticks put off every hour
Try to over do it you gone find yourself off in the shower
This is not some powder the effects are completely differant
You are not a coward if you pop one and get scared of the shit
You might forget what you did the night before if you want 'em
Better get somebody to be witcha only if they ass is sober
Gotta keep my fuckin brain on chicken lane change only if the beat bang
I'll be able to do my thang no what I got to do know why I gotta rock
Fucked up or not I'ma take this shit to the top
If you see me in the streets betta believe me this cracker is off the hezzy
Memphis, Tennessee is my stopping ground and zanex bars just went down in me
This weed in me and Henessey all over my academics T
Was fucked up and doubled in for shit but fallin up out the S-you-V
They serious don't play with 'em if you can't handle 'em come my way
We'll rock 'em to the BAY and we'll deal 'em up on the slang
When I bump my female in an all night bang with a BIOTCH!

[Chorus]",Look Like You
Lil Wyte," 

2 door cut with flippy flop on the paint
looking like a bag of skittles that will make you wan't to faint
eyes cocked ass drop when pulled up on the set
people scard to touch my car like they might fall in and get wet
I can't keep my whip in sun for so long cause it might melt like a pack
of starburst on a summer day sitting on the shelf
I got to get her out
get her high
take her out for a ride
hopefully tonight I won't commit vehicular homicide
my cutless is clean as a fuckin whistle
Paul, and Juicy both told me I better pack pistols
pistols plural for the one's of those who do not know
I gon let these bitches rip the bay and try to take my hoe

[Chorus - 2X]
2 door cut with flip the flop like (ridin down the street smokin weed getting high)
2 door cut with flip the flop like (woooooooooooo man that fool clean)

cheech and chong up in smoke and dice on mirria
2007 cadalac space age interior
4 Pioners 4 ways across the back dash
4 12's when I come through I'm gon break glass
and that's just the beginning
I ain't got into the engine
fuckin with gray steerin wheels I'm gripin white pearl pimpin
It's on italian leather just as icey as my soljas
pictured on the white pearl gas pedal belive I told ya
and ain't doja on me when I ride make me a blunt
ain't tryin to be nobodys police when I creep the cut
they got enough on me already they don't need my car
If they won't me so bad they can find me standin in my yard

[Chorus - 2X]

It's time to talk about the muscle in this perfect creation
brand new chevy blocked and it's chromed out it will block conberation
a set of double hard heads shift kit and a kaft
flowed out with a pair of dogs hanging out the ass
brain gon and my hair blowin doin a buck 4
wow hoe if you in the road
better move yo ass out the path fast
before yo ass have to feel
20 inch spinner and 22 hundred pounds of steel
I'm a good driver but can get reckless on purple leana
pedal to the metal might hit ya and never even seen ya
take my word I put 15 G's into these souls
I'm gon flick this bitch and figurer out how to drop off 20 more

I woke up early to see the sunrise right across from outta of my eyes
Let me see these haters clearly whenever I stop down the drive by
I am a dramatic, most static addict, a rehab with automatic
doubt me now I made it, phinally phamouse bout to let you have it
This is not a game kin fold game not playin' with ya
Gotta brang the slangs ?? ain't gone paint yo picture
Some of the story we can tell it's just bout a communication
The shit you take turn the head all over the nation
I been waitin' for vacations and the money that I'm makin'
Muthafuckas hatin' now that I'm on they times
Waisted I'ma do it for the bay and for my children and the war
And let these non believers know that we all been here before
Reality don't exsist like ?? dream, quote, Johnny Wide miss him bad may he rest in peace

All I want to do is smoke my dro..bitch
Sit on the couch get high n get throwed bitch
Or in the car windows cracked gettin loaded
I'm representin everybody out there smokin

[Lil Wyte]
Roll it up, fire it up, chief it up
I'm ready to get fucked up
Soon as I get control of the dro I'm ready to feel the stuff
Light green marijuana been tellin me how it want to
Go get up wit a swisher split the middle and bone a
I feel that I should get atleast one commercial from King Edward
I been smokin these blunts so long and look where my futures headed
I feel that dro work like Wheeties to rappers that are intelligent
Smoke you one and hit the mic the rest of the shit is irrelevant
A lot of shit has happened since the last time you've heard my album
And I ain't talkin about no acid, oxycotton or valiums
I'm talkin about myself all the shit I've seen and the green I smoke
I'll be goin back to California but for now I Qoute...

Lil Wyte," 

Yeah, a lot of motherfuckers
Be out here trying to act like
They're so hard and shit
But you always got to realize, nigga
You ain't bulletproof
And your body ain't bulletproof
At any given time
You can get your ass fucking blown the fuck off
This motherfucking place the Earth
So don't never think a nigga ain't watching
I got somebody watching
Yeah, you know what time it is

[Lil Wyte]
I'm a motherfucking...
[Chorus - 2x]
Static addict, static addict, loco with that automatic
(3x)
Static addict, static addict, crazy with the gun

Gimme a Glock, gimme a 4-5
And I would be straight
Might make it through the day
But by the night I'd need two AKs
A couple of sets of extra clips
And some ham sandwiches
The po-pos know me
And their used to my shananagans
I run the set, man, causing chaos everywhere
want to make a bet, man
I'll have you pulling out your hair
This is a have-to-do job
But on a need-to-know basis
Don't keep your eyeballs on the prize
Don't keep up with the faces
I roll with murderers, robbers
Drug dealers, killers, and rapists
Also an army on the porch
With plenty rockets a'waitin
Come test my patience, fool
And find out how Lil Wyte will react
I'll have these haters, fool
Flopping like some fish on their back
They got me fucked up
I'm about to load them trucks up
When I get crazy then you
Just might feel some hot stuff
This was not on my agenda
I was just only playing
But since you're testing my gangsta
It's too damn late for praying

[Chorus - 2x]

Automatic gun fire busting at you hoes
To get my point across
You got raw bullet to your dome
Is what I'm about to toss
Sold me a short sack
Now you about to feel the trauma
Sulfuric acid, so clogged
In a pine box for your momma
What am I about to do
Some says you already know
Bring your family in this? No!
I ain't as cool as you folks
This shits between me and you
But between you and me
I got a feeling it might be all up to G-O-D
And you can talk all of the trash
You want it don't even matter
As long as my album keep selling
My pockets gonna get fatter
I guess the static is because
I am the chosen one
Deadly circumstances come with job
Better have your gun
You might be found bleeding
Seeking for the perpetrator
Something tells me he real far
And you won't find him, player
Quit your crying, bitching
And your whining, hating
Faking, fronting
I'll run your ass up up off the block
'Cause I'm a motherfucking

With bullets wizzin by, children dyin every 36 seconds
It makes it uncomfortable for me to even respect this
With this focused brain I can take myself away from pain
Turn me into rain, sprinkle it upon all of us in vein
I'm the one that was sent to make sure the sun will always shine
Try to determin the evil and good all in my twisted mind
Hopefully, this just might be the one that reaches to the world
And make a safer place to play for all our little boys and girls
'cause I'm a soldier don't get it twisted
Get your wig split
Fifty millimeter shells aiming for the terrorist
Must have missed 'cause they still comin with some big shit
Osama fucked up real deep and there ain't no time to fix it
He better be off the planet, two light years passed the moon
Rode on a magic carpet satellites gonna find him soon
He's probably already dead fuckin with tha U.S.A
But if not he better not bring his ass up in tha bay

[Juicy J:]
Let me hear tha sound of tha soldiers
I said let me hear tha sound of tha soldiers
Juicy J tha soldier boy
The marines ain't no punk and you know we keep grenades and AK's in the trunk
With Iraq we be buck, we be fightin and we stomp
With our fist, with our feet, we be ready when you jump
We don't hide behind mask like a terrorist my nigg
Just so you know who tha real fuckin cowards is.

Until the day I day
You cool with me in my face
But a hater in disguise (What?)
You can get slapped down
When I'm your town
Poppin' off some rounds
When I'm on that crown
We usually pull up slow
With lights off and guns drawn
Everything bout to go
You ain't no hood ? might go home
Take it easy
They don't want shit
Except yo life
They'll even take a small fry
Some coke and your wife
You should of thought about circumstances
Repercussions and consequences
But you didn't
Now your swimmin' somewhere in the Mississippi

I ain't goin' no where
I been chillin' in the same cut
Smokin' on the same blunt
Feelin' on the same butt
Still fuck with the six
Still roll wit some killas'
Still hang wit a big cliche
And kick it wit drug dealers
So, whatcha' wanna do?
I can have your whole crew
Hog tied, buried alive
Underneath the swimmin' pool
But, no I'm not a evil dude
In fact I'm pretty fuckin' humble
Four hundred thousand records
In the pit, ya hear my stomach bubble
I'm just gettin' started pimpin'
You ain't seen retarded pimpin'
Fuck it, I'll be modest to me
I'm the fucking hardest pimpin'
I can't spit it harmless
And horrific and the same time
Kill ya, bring ya to life
And get ya high with the same rhyme

[Chorus]

OK you, ask me how I do it
I call it white boy magic
I'm not the only one rich
I just flash it with a passion
Shoulda been missin' in action
But now I'm back
White rappers better duck and hide
And for all the hatas I have arrived
So guard your grill
And avert your eyes
Smoke on, keep cheifin'
Ain't tryin' to ruin your weekend
But I'll fuck your mother though
And show you the real me
Then I'm theifin'
I be grindin'
While you whinin'
I be shinin' like a diamond
You thought that this dirt would still get work
Even if I was a realtor buildin' dollars
But, keep your head up
I was not tryin' to destroy your dreams
Like Katt Williams said ""It's all good pimpin', you can hate on me""
The more you talk
The more it let me know
How walkers do it faster
Keep your mouth open
Runnin' at all times
Motha fucka

Lil' Mo' Yin Yang,"Man, women, boy, women, girl
Women without a man is nothing
Without her, man is nothing
Women have their faults
Men only have two
Everything they say and everything they do
Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage
They've experienced pain
And have bought jewelry
Women have two weapons
Cosmetics and tears
I'm a perfect house keeper
Every time I leave a man I keep his house
No women has ever hated a man
Enough to give him back his diamonds
Why don't women blink during foreplay?
They don't have time
Man, women, boy, women, girl
Men forget everything
Women remember everything
A girl can wait for the right man to come along
But it doesn't stop her from having fun
With all the wrong ones in the mean time
The real reason why it's so difficult to find men
Who are sensitive, caring and good looking?
Is because they all have boyfriends already
A successful man is one who makes more money
Than his wife can spend
A successful women is one who can find such a man
Man, women, boy, women, girl
Women driver really means
Someone who doesn't speed, tailgates
Swear, make obscene gestures
And has a better driving record than men have
It's a guy thing really means
Irrational, illogical, stupid and extremely low
Oh don't fuss I just cut myself, it's no big deal
Really means I'm about to die but before I die
I want you to remember me as a strong proud man
Who never cries
Man, women, boy, women, girl
If you want to learn more about women
Watch 'Sex in the City'
If you want to learn more about men
Take a good look at Homer Simpson

Is that men can sleep all night with a light on",Reach [Yin Yang Dub]

The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holdin' my own breath
Right up to the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares.
Someone to love with my life in their hands.
There's gotta be somebody for me like that.

And everyone wants to know they're not alone.
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere.
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.

And dammit this feels too right

I don't need dough to own that ho, you get it?
Anotha nigga never will I owe, you get it?
In the video, the five we flossin in it
How I know every one that you had was tinted
Admit it, six O-O see me in it
Sunroof open, I'm smokin, haters rock wit it
Bithces cluckin, hopin they could go for a ride
Get a lady by my side, when we puff La
If a nigga try me, shit, rather die
She said her favorite song was, Ebony and I
The dick make em happy, I'm they baby daddy
Flossin in the 6 yeah, me and Puff Daddy

[Chorus]
Just a little....(a little bit of sex is all it takes)
A little bit of head I'm on my way
Six naw shit col. I don't play
So lets have an orgy
Let me bust a nut all on your face
Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight
If you freaky, can my man get laid?
So lets have an orgy, girl

[Verse2]
Ey yo, when my nut drop it's gon be sweet as candy
I'm so for real, that's why them bitches can't stand me
Cease a Lee, nuttin sweet, real nasty, and classy

Black Navy, I fuck hoez 'cause they nag me
That was back when I didn't have a pot to piss in
Now my nigga Blake gettin head in the Kitchen
I'll bust off and get to missin, listen
If you ain't a freak, I don't need ya
I want a real bitch, that suck a dime out a parkin meter
Read the scripture
When I stroke, It's like I'm in a picture, Kodak
I love a bitch wit a pussy clean like, Flo-jack
I'm stuck in 86, still call my dick, my Balzak
Too young, stick it in these hoez know that
You want to stay or roll?
Here's a .9 here hold that
Bust up on yo face, lips, tits and all that...

Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight
If you freaky, can my man get laid?
So lets have an orgy, girl

[Verse 3]
Yo, when the smoke is gone who they focus on?
When you hear the Mafia, a nigga know it's on
Call me Cease A Leo or Cease a LeLO
Long as me and Rock fuck bitches by the trio
Put that on my nigga B.I.G, Never will I be no
Cat ridin around in a nast ass Geo
Not even a year in the game, getin the range
And hoez give me head just for hearin my name

Why should I have a bitch when I could see yours?
Before you start some shit, be sure

And I got a easy livin, fuck easy women
We aced out, take anotha G from the linen
A nigga day dream about the V's he be spinnin

Yo I remember far back as the game goes 

>From the first bank rollz to the Cool Jeanz and Kango's 

Breezing on the yacht, Dp's on the rock 

Think of all the fly V's we used to swap 

We took it up a notch 

And everything that was hot, for $5,000 we copped 

Little Cease, I'd a cop, rock, all types of a satch 

50 G's on the watch, me and you up in the Spot 

MtV was in shock, and I don't see why not 

Man, we used to rock all the BET spots 

Turned clubs into stadiums 

And I remember when you and Rock got knocked in the Paladium 

And when we rock we do it all for you 

And uh, don't gotta worry bout the names they was calling you 

And I'ma tell you what we gonna do 

Make hits and couldn't quit if we wanted to (yes I, won't stop) 

Even though you're outta sight, you're never outta mind 

I try to tell myself, when it's yo time, it's yo time 

Ever since that weekend, everybody been beefin' and greifing 

Losin they appetites, nobody eatin (miss you, yeah) 

And it's due to all the weavin, I walked yo kidz to your coffin 

And tell em ?daddy's sleeping? (daddy's sleeping) 

But Killa he don't understand 

He don't know that ignorance killed a wonderful man 

You're not just another Rapper, wit money in yo hand 

I think, what's the money, when I ain't got my man 

That's why day's I walk the surface, feeling earthless (Oh Biggie) 

Thinking was this rap shit really worth it (is it really worth it?) 

And I know you didn't deserve it, It went so smooth 

You thought they rehearsed it, Worst shit I ever 

Seen at a young age, it's fucked up when I see my man on front page 

I reminisce on the old days, Love, Forever and Always

When I beeped her, she called me right back
I layed my game down quite flat

Threw on my white hat with no hesitation
White Benz, white nad
White on white racing

To jeeps with paper plates
So a chick can, come before my paperchase
Wanna hit the cell
Roc make em wait
If I ain't make a mill
I can't take a break
I like to vacate down in Bermuda
Sip my coleurs while I'm headed down to Hooters
Everytime we scoop her
The chickens wanna tutor
Girls wanna fight and
Throwing ice from the cooler
This chick is a loser
Smoke on niggas buddah
Dick ride on every niggas scooter

But if it wasn't for this rap shit
I never would have knew her

[Verse 1]
Get this money, get with it
If its dirty you can't spend it
Leave mama the whole business
Just in case I get sent to prison
I done made some bad decisions
But I put my last on these fuckin' lyrics
To make the world feel it
And run over all competition
Takin the pain, on the mission
Say it in vain, contradict
Felony, and jealousy raw enemies
You ain't never, had a friend like me
Will I live to see twenty three
Or will them guerillas come for me
They gone' remember evil L-I-L-E
My destiny, what's in the cemetery
This is what's left and this shit done got scary
Don't come near me, is it deadly, very
What's his name, Eric

(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
Melody, revolved around felony, cuttin our body
Tell me will this one bring evil things
Emarked, by enemy, I need thoroughs eve
The son inside of me
Tellin me, it's old fella Duke
And if they kill me
They gon' have to kill you
Now gimme death
The realest nigga to put his hood on the map
Took the hood off the track
Put gangsta on the rap
Kept my strap, cause the game gettin' cold
Even if my laws collapse
Bitch I'm dying like a soldier
The killa still ain't know, mama told us
The law will show ya
Twenty five feets on the streets, fuck peace
I'm tryna make a mealticket before I rest in peace
You and me, me and you, in this bitch together
Nigga what, we gone' represent this bitch forever

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
Nigga I'm from the M.I.
Where there ain't no such thing as dying
Get mine, I need it all I'm tryna get by
From 6-1 to 6-5, 6-5 to 6-9
Cheatin' on a dime, I ain't hard to find
I done crossed the line, half the world mine
Let me get meat, I know it brings enemies
But momma gotta eat
Kid need shoes on they feet
Shit ain't lookin' sweet
I'm a man now
Young, black, and thugged out
But when it comes to the money
Fuck the playa now
Don't mess up the couch
Put it all in the right of my
Fifty goin 50, what that be bout
The dirty south wit me, I'ma riv a brick
Cause I know they comin to get me
They don't want to see that nigga rich
Fuck this shit, until they kill this

I'm an 18 year old CEO 
I got fans that's dyin to see me flow
my favorite movie is CB-4
H$E Click you know we throwed
I'm 6 foot 1 on the digital scale
I'm a ghetto star and a man as well
and I'm all about my mail like a man in jail
I wonder if I put my tape out, can it sell?
only time will tell how many copies get sold
and I pray to god that I live to get old
'cause half of my homeboys already dead
and the other half doin time with the feds
I'm like the CincinnatI Reds  I'm playin ball for the pennant
and if I fall while I'm tryin I start from the beginning
they say practice make perfect and it really paid off
I'm my own boss now so I can't get laid off
and I'm gonna stay the same flip no matter what it takes
and I won't stop rappin no matter how much I make
Whether I'm rich or broke i'ma still crack jokes
and I never turn my back on mobbin foes

(Lil' Flip)
I done been through a lot of pain
at an early age ??? gave me silent game
I got knowledge but I didn't get it from college man
I'm not gonna change because I'm flyin private planes
and if I don't work, my pockets hurt
man it costs a lot of money livin on this earth
everybody got to shine but it's my turn
the early bird gets the worm that's what I learned
ever since I was a kid I had to ball
I don't smoke cigarettes and I hate alcohol
I went from being a janitor to a manager
when you become a star with me, want to dance with yah
I'm gonna keep my platinum teeth and my pants saggin
now everybody want to jump on the band waggon
I ain't braggin, because I got a little change, 
I ain't gonna let my head blow up 'cause I got a little fame
now when my cousin died things got a little strange
I know the block is hot just ask lil wayne
everybody dream about goin to hollywood
but look how fast I turned clover land into ???

everyday I'm on the paper chase
I gotta win first place in this paper race

From yo' block to my block, we packin' clips

Late night, if you don't work you don't eat
That shit is fo' real
You hustlin' for tennis shoes, put that shit on yo' bills
Dope fiends everywhere, like H2O
We don't believe in police, cause they too slow
I had to do what I did so I could get what I got
You wanna feel like I feel then go sit on my block
You might see teenagers, flippin' and workin'
You might see canines, sniffin' and searchin'
You might see plastic bags with drugs and stuff
You might see a whole block full of thugs and stuff
Be quiet cell phones got bugs and stuff
Real niggas in the kitchen cuttin' stuff
Wrap it up, zip it up after it bubble up
I got dreams of seeing all my money double up
I gotta get it, cause I got a family to feed
If you feel what I'm sayin' put yo' hand on yo' heat

Do any niggas wanna step to this?
I back 'em down with tha nickel-plated fifth, watch the hip
Look at your men, they all jumpin' ship
And I ain't even bring an extra clip
Just imagine if I brought my nigga Flip
We comin' for yo' grip, that rubber band shit
And tha KG9, it spit sick, and you'll notice
Your final notice, ready to die
Like my nigga Biggie from best high, keep yo' hands high
My whole clicks alibi, fuck the piece I want the whole damn pie
Eight sounds tha best high
I get it with my lips or with the rubber grip
Smoke kicks than Matrix, you cats ain't seen shit
You really know who you fuckin',you betta tell 'em Flip

I bust shots, ya'll call cops, fuck 911 nigga we blaze spots

Hey Flip, from my block to yo block, I'm thugged out
I'm realizin' its some soljas Down South
Scream it loud, if you the meanest nigga
Affiliated with guns, gang bangers that pull triggas
Me and my niggas, feelin' trapped like we in a maze
Misbehave, refuse, to be a slave
And you can't break me, if the Lord want me, let him take me
Respect mine, I'm livin'life by the tech 9
I'm livin' now while I'm still hea
Fuck it when I'm gone
Long as tha homies pour the beer I know its still on
We high, gettin' drunk, doin' what we want
Jail can't change us it only makes us dangerous

We roll V12 motors, Pittsburgh to tha Clovers
Down South they lean, the East be never sober
Elected by the voters, ride just like a lotus
I'll buy the house, never get an eviction notice
You niggas bogus, gotta keep my mind focused
Lost in the jungle, this animal's ferious
My hyponosis, count my nets and my brouses
Sell a bunch of records, like Hootie and tha Blowfish
After I recite this, you niggas shouldn't quote this
Godfather, fragilistic xpalidosius
Street bums, rap for pennies and nickels
Like nigga la vocal, give 'em the Russian sickle

Look, I stay on my block
I get paid on my block
It ain't no such thing as being afraid on my block
I'm true to my block, I shoot wit my glock
If I don't know you, I don't wanna see you on my block
I stack on my block, I park my 'Lac on my block
Even though I'ma star, I go back to my block
I hang on my block, they know my name on my block
And every since I blew up, it ain't tha same on my block
I live on my block, I eat ribs on my block
You might see me wit William Gibbs on my block
I'm real wit my block, I chill on my block
7 years and 5 days nigga, and I'm still on my block

",My Block
Lil' Flip,"Got to do something for the playas if you ain't a real playa
You'll have to go to the back of the club, this for the playas
And the ballas and the pimps, for everybody, south side
Who rocking lots of ice, teeth shine, piece shine
Pull up looking clean on two twenty's nigga

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

I just put some new rugs in my two story club
Hoes getting dug in my king size tub
Boys getting drugged, trying to act like a thug
No fucking love while I sip purple mud
I fly like a dove, smoke like a champ

Never run from no one 'cause I might catch a cramp
Smoking damp, fucking on a old school tramp
Ten dollar rock for a twenty food stamp
My name is Carlos holla fuck these hoes
Life is like ballet stay on your toes

My dream is to keep the world up all night
'Cause I got enough 'caine to have a snowball fight
I floss gators, got cribs with elevators
So much cash I bought a pool for my neighbors
Dope house and sucka free, run your ass up a tree
Fuck with me and you'll be keeping dad company

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

When I walk into the club people say, ?Where he go??
But when I open up my mouth they be like, ?There he go?
When Redd sliding through the club I'm throwing my elbows
Any girl I snag, she sticking like velcrow
And when I take my watch off, they say, ?Who cut the lights off??

And I can freestyle all night until they cut the mics off
As soon as I touch the stage, broads ain't paging they man
Instead they spilling liquor, waving they hands
Well I'm a valet parker and a endo sparker
So many waves in my hair I got to wear swimming goggles

Now we ready to buy the bar tossing shit the counter
People notice my name and run over the [unverified]
Now when you see me in the club, I'm dressed top of the line
I'm mixing up codeine and popping bottles of wine
I met a chicken head from Michigan showing her tattoo
Hit it off at the bar too, let's scram so we could car pool

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

Hey, this for my Blacks, Asians, Chinese and Caucasians
Muslims, Irish and even Jamaicans, Hispanics, Indians
Throw your sets up and all the fine women, raise your dress up
Hold up your piece if you got ice in it
And put your white cups up if you got pink sprite in it

You might see me at the bar but I don't drink that much
I just bought an Escallade and I'm gone paint that truck
I got three million in the bank, but it ain't that much
Now when I look at magazines I say ain't that us
I'm in the VIP section, wearing a black dob

I got the women screaming whoa but my name ain't Black Rob
Man, they screaming Lil' Flip at the front of the club
A nigga buzzed off this remmy with a blunt and a hug
When sucka free in the club women lose they brains
If I need ice in my cup, then I use my chain, bling bling

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free
",Put Yo Fist Up
Lil' Flip,"It's the 8 rulez on the streets
You live by this, you won't get holed up

1, never let a nigga know yo business
2, always start what you finish
3, stay on yo note, don't slip
4, be careful 'cause these streets are a trip

5, always keep a glock in yo whip
6, real niggaz stick to the script
7, don't slang crack where you stay
8, just don't do it, okay?

In my hood all you see is dope fiends an' dope dealers
Rats an' roaches, police an' 4 wheelers
[Incomprehensible], pawn shops, liquor stores
30 year old men, chillin', drinkin [Incomprehensible]

Stop signs, but don't nobody ever stop
It's ten groups in my hood, but don't nobody drop
Plus the block is hot an' this dope game cold
Through rain, sleet or snow, birds gotta get sold

Birds get sold, I stand an' watch the game unfold
Thing gets low, I told my connect right in the snow
They exchanged the dough, leave the scene wit no clue
4 words you gotta remember, 'Don't break the rules'

Use your tools, it's kinda like you move, you loose
If you don't fuck wit me, I ain't fuckin' wit you
Check the game 'til you see my weapon aim
Nigga, I ain't a rookie I'm a veteran, mayne

1, never let a nigga know yo business
2, always start what you finish
3, stay on yo note, don't slip
4, be careful 'cause these streets are a trip

5, always keep a glock in yo whip
6, real niggaz stick to the script
7, don't slang crack where you stay
8, just don't do it, okay?

Hustle for yo whip, stack Benjamins
Buy a cookie cutter, whip it, ship it, then I'm in the wind
Back to home base, I'm on a paper chase
I'm not a case catcher, so I can't catch a case

Money on my mind an' how am I gonna get it
I dress like I'm broke, but I'm really runnin' the city
Bricks turn into crumbs, gallons turn into ones
Drugs, violence, distributin' narcotics usin' guns

Money, cash, hoes, swangin' glass folds
Get the dough, pay the bills, man, that's all I know
Hustlers never sleep an' sleepers never hustle
Down on the interstate with a brick in my muffler

Keep it on a low 'cause niggas be snitchin'
They'll do anythin', so they won't see prison
Man, you never know, yo brother could be a snitch
A month later, now you got Undercovers shakin' yo piss

I'm off the block, somebody better call the cops
I'm haulin' rocks, somebody better call the doc
I'm shippin' an' handlin', when I'm not chicken dismantlin'
The family don't feed me, I feed the family

1, never let a nigga know yo business
2, always start what you finish
3, stay on yo note, don't slip
4, be careful 'cause these streets are a trip

5, always keep a glock in yo whip
6, real niggaz stick to the script

Lil' Flip
Represent
7-1-3

Now when you see me in the Lamborghini speeding, bumpin Screw
I know you see my license plate, ""Lil' Flip number two""
I use to skip summer school, hit the block and move work
That was enough to buy some shoes, pants, and a new shirt
Now I'm shinin like Puff, wearin diamonds like Puff
We got everybody else music sounding like US
So hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been bumpin Screw down here for a while!
And when you see me at the mall, Just me and my dawg
I'm shoppin with them, Cause I ain't trickin for a broad
I do shows and rock crowds, And then I get paid
Summer time, I'm on dubs, Winter time, I'm on blades
My whole click livin laid, man we all got Vets
My crib so big, I ain't even see my room yet
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been buyin six-figure homes for a while!
Now when you see me in the Vibe, Murder Dog and The Source
And the XXL, standing next to a Porsche
I get paid with my voice, so I pimp these beats
I hate commercial rap, so I pimp these streets
You don't work you don't eat, that's a known fact
I just don't rap, nigga I know how to act
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been fuckin with magazines for a while!

[Chourus x1]
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
The type of Rappers y'all never goin be!
We makin money y'all never goin see!
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
Houston, Texas nigga!

Now when you see me with Tigga, On BET
Or 106 and Park, with AJ and Free
Or MTV, come take a look at my house
And after that, come take a look at my mouth
Yea I represent the South, like Pastor Troy
And I'm still Fresh and Clean, like Andre and Big Boi
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been talkin shit on TV for a while!
Now when you see me with a sweet, blowing smoke out my nose
9 times outta 10, I'm probably blowin Hydro
So don't blow my high, just leave me alone!
Cause I get high like Cheech and Chong
Call me 'Afroman' when my hair ain't braided
I got 20 tatoo's but I'm still educated
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been smokin high-time weed for a while!
And when you see my at the club, I gotta get my floss on
Techno, my ring shinnin, and I got my cross on
I gotta brand new phone, Cause I'ma rich nigga
And when people call, you can see they picture
I'm still Lil'Flipper, but my money got taller
And my Benz got wider, and your hundred got smaller
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been acting bad, drivin cars for a while!
When you see me Big Pimpin, like UGK
I'm choppin on blades, candy-paint, Jog Grey
I'm sittin on Twenty's, but I'm twenty-one
I'm ridin with an AK, you still got a be	-be	 Gun
So you need to Back, Back, and gimme 50 feet
Cause you ain't sellin records like Sucka-Free
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been ridin around with straps for a while!

Lil' Flip,"I come in the club everybody standin' on the corner
But me some weed, speed, or some marijuana
You can get it right here or get it right there
But when the laws pull up get away from 'round there
Niggas thinkin' that the nigga changin
Just 'cause a nigga platinum be hanging
I still got the same niggas that I'm with
If a nigga owe me money we gon'shoot up his shit
I use to sell work I use to sell pints
But now I'm doing shit I gotta million in the bank
I done made a lot of moves and payed a lot of dues
Nigga if you fuck with me, you might make the news
Now niggas get on T.V then forget they partnas
The ones that keep it real come sharp with the choppas
The one who drank and lean in they house
Them lil niggas be the one who represent the south uh

[Chorus:]
I want the money
I don't give a fuck about the fame
No matter how rich I get Lil' Flip will never change
I want the money
I don't give a fuck about the fame
I do this shit so I can have some pocket change

Now every time I come back somebody went to jail
But they taught us don't go to school and fail
I didn't go to college but its money in my wallet
And I just bought a Jag '0 mileage
And I keep a clip ya know I'm strapped
And you was hatin' on me nigga you might get slapped
Ya telephone tap'ed got the (?)matter of fact
It don't look good for you to be standing on blocks
Nigga what about the cops rollin through looking
And everybody know that you sellin and cookin
So get yo mind right nigga stay out the streets
You seen what I did, now I play with these beats

[Chorus:]

I'm like a hundred-dollar bill I'm hard change
And now its funny everybody ain't acting the same
Rule number one never tell these rats learn ya business
Rule two never ever burn by bridges
I had niggas that was hatin' now they in my face
Way before ""buy the car, by the house"", ""diamondsNyaface""
Now they see me in the streets I want to do a song
Nigga yous a hoe go back to yo home!
'Cause you ain't selling records don't get mad
'Cause you see me ballin' hard in a dropped Jag
When you see me at the source chunk up the duece
'Cause I represent the Cloverland jumpin' out my Coupe
I still be the same nigga on the scene
I'm still gone be the only freestyle king

[Chorus:]",Forget the Fame
Lil' Flip,"[Talking]
For the hoe ass niggas

[Lil' Flip]
They call me Thunder Cat, cause I got so many hoes
They call me cookie man, cause I sold so many o's
Did a lot of shows, made a lot of cash
Slid out the Benz, jumped in a jag
Jumped out the Jag, then I hopped in a Hummer
Guess what I drop, underground this summer
But get ready, for the shit about to hit the air
And bitch you ain't smoking endo, so I don't care

[Chorus]

[Lil Ron]
Say Flip, look at all these hoes
Some are girls, but its niggas also
I'm tired of getting attention, when walking in places
Niggas is hating, I'm fin to hurt they faces
Change the paces, winning the races
Money I'm making, cookies a nigga baking
Feeling my status, above average
Lil Ron be ready for all that static

[Lil' Flip]
We got automatics, nigga we still thuggin'
Nigga we still hustlin', all the hoes still loving
The way that we flowing, the cars that we driving
The way that we hustle, that's the way we surviving
Going to shows, going to clubs
Riding on Blaze, riding on Dubs
We from the south, we country as hell
why'all smoking that brown weed, we got that funky smell
The dro and the do-do, the blueberry endo
Riding on low-lows (Flip there go the po-pos)

Step out, let me see your license

If the laws pull you over, he a hoe
She a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe
If she want child support, she a hoe

If he fucked up your car, he a hoe
She a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe
If she tear up your Bentley she a hoe

[Redd]
I ain't never been the type, to be in love with a hoe
Instead I'm trying to leave, out the club with a hoe
A basket case, I spit in a bastard's face
Walk in, crash the party, and trash the place
Fuck it I tried to tell em, some niggas wouldn't like it
Too bad, you should of seen it coming like a psychic
Then its, back to the Benz that's sitting on chrome men
Waving at the hoes, yelling aiight then

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
Ki's from over seas, for me that's just some cain

Coming down, gripping grain up on the do'
On the flo man you slow, and not knowing that she's a hoe

You might see me in the benzo
Sitting on Lorenzos, blowing on some endo
It's five o'clock so I'ma drop my top, and let down my window
I'm candy paint with DVD's and PlayStation 2
I got a mic with a crown on top that say R.I.P. DJ Screw
But I'ma hold it down like it's no cigo'
Make this screw shit coast to coast
I can't be stopped like a locomotive, M P see H P eighty rolling
My paper folding like laundromats, S P S black Cadillacs
E S 1's 'cause cataracts, Gucci suit with the hat to match

Like Fat Pat I'm on chrome, my Prime Co. on roam
Sold out shows at the Astro Dome, y'all ain't know my money long
Y'all money gone 'cause we changed the game
And came with tighter flows
I wear expensive clothes got plenty hoes, 'cause nigga that's all I know
Like shopping sprees and credit cards, two ways and cellulars
Smoking blunts and pulling broads, everyday I'm switching cars
But I'm a superstar like Denzel, but I ain't gone win a Grammy
I sold a hundred thousand now I see why niggas can't stand me

Chain and charm with two my chain
Project corner with too much weight
Sleep day time and work at night, making cash is my life
Sipping Sprite and breaking mics, winning money, shaking dice
Hitting licks and shaking vikes, you want three chickens pay the price
Bubble light on foreign wheels, iced out grill'll make me chill
Peanut butter in my Seville, buy a pint and pop a sill

Buy a pint and I'll pop a sill, and my blaze chop like a south-mill
Y'all hatas mad 'cause we in a Jag
And that Iceberg got us dressed to kill
How you feel 'cause I'm fired up, pour me up another cup
It's S you see and Swisha House, and them big faces we fold up
Lil' Ron make you hold up while I take a trip with Lil' Flip
Blow'd get you wide up and it'll make your ass run off a cliff
Kenoe got the track throwed, we making hatas hate us bad

Lil' Flip," 

huh huh
I had to do somethin like dis
ya know
huh I shoulda listened
I shoulda listened

[Lil' Flip - Verse 1]
I shoulda listened, when ya said boy go and get a job
I shoulda listened, cause you gotta sell dope or rob
I shoulda listened, when you told me I need to go to college
but right now I'm tryin to money in my wallet
I shoulda listened, when you said boy make good grades
but instead I was worryin about dem new j's
I shoulda listened, when you said boy don't get no tattoos
now it's 2 years later and now I got 22
I shoulda listened, when you said keep playin basketball
but I was makin mo money standin in the hall
I shoulda listened, when you said I need to be in the church
but that's hard ""why"" cause everyday I gotta concert
I shoulda listened, when you said I need to watch my friends
cause yesterday my partner got jacked fo' his Benz
I shoulda listened, when you said don't stand on the corner
cause all black folks do is smoke marijuana

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I shoulda listened, when yo told me don't do that I did it any way
I shoulda listened, when yo told me don't hustle but I gotta get paid

[Lil' Flip - Verse 2]
I shoulda listened, when you said quit standin on the block
cause all that do is make it easy fo the cops
I shoulda listened, when you said it don't matta what car you drive
long as you pay yo bills long as you survive
I shoulda listened, when you said don't be hangin at the club
cause people get drunk and want to shoot the club up 
I shoulda listened, when you said you can't please everybody
right now I'm findin out I don't need everybody
I shoulda listened, when you said don't brind dem niggaz to ya house
cause when you ain't there they'll try to break in ya house
I shoulda listened, when you told me you read what ya so
so everybody I meet I can't treat'em like a hoe
I shoulda listened, when ya told me do somethin wit my time
so I picked up the pen and paper and now I'm writtin ryhmes
I shoulda listened, when you said forget the money put God first
so that's the way I gotta end my verse

[Chorus] - repeat to fade",I Shoulda Listened
Lil' Flip," 

[Lil' Flip]
Uh, take a look in my eyes, tell me what you see
A nigga who was young, grew up to be a G
I started off playin basketball for my coach
He started hatin so I took a differint approach
I'ma rap, fuck sweatin, and I'ma do somthin
(like what) that a nigga won't be regrettin
Could I ride? (no)
Could I steal? (no)
Could I jack? (no)
Should I kill? (no)
Nah, I gotta get my shit together
Cause a nigga need a house and big furniture with the leather
I pick up the pen, I pick up the pace
And I used to be broke I couldn't even pick up my face
And now, listen to the shit a nigga be doin
While you nigga's thinkin that a nigga's career be ruined
From smokin, and drinkin
Drinkin, and smokin
And I'ma try and go platinum while you thinkin and hopin
Wishin and lookin, trying to do what I do
And if ya fuck with me, ill shoot or ill sue
And how you want to' handle business, I can get it like that
And sellin work on the block, I used to get it like that
But I had to back back, and open up my eyes
When you runnin in these streets, you might get a surprise
Your friend could be a foe, your girl could be a hoe
And everybody you think got your back, you don't know
Doop been here before a nigga got rich
So Doop right here when I ridin in my 6
My nigga Cease make beats for me everyday
And guess what he don't never ask to get payed
My nigga Red keep it real, Hump got my back
When I didn't have a car, Hump bought a Lac
Now Hump bought a Jag, and I'm in it
Runnin through these hoes but my name ain't Emitt
Uh

[Chorus: Lil' Flip]
It's a fact - everybody smiling ain't your friend
Everybody with a grin contemplating on you man
It's a fact - you reap what you sow, better watch what you do
Cause you'll do it to somebody that'll do it to  you
It's a fact - your best friend will turn his back on ya
Pull a gat on ya, even rat on ya
It's a fact - that most niggaz act like hoes
It's a fact - that most niggaz act like hoes

[Lil' Flip]
Now who can you trust, who can you depend on?
When you all broke need money to lend on
When you tryin'a ball and your money been gone
When you tryn'a put the down payment on 10 homes
Will your nigga ride for you? Will your nigga bust?
Will a nigga come and get your ass out them cuffs?
Will your nigga take you to the mall and buy some clothes?
Will your nigga ever put you first before them hoes?
Will your nigga buy you drank and smoke up the weed?
Ride for your ass when niggaz shootin down your street
Come to your funeral and tell a fuckin story
Think about them nuts that we took with no glory
That category, the list
The rappin the hoes, the hoes and the shows
It comes and it goes
De Da De Da De Da

[Flip talking]
Straight up nigga, that's how I feel
Know what I'm sayin'?
Everybody needs to be ballin nigga
If you got chain nigga, your nigga need to have a chain
If you gotta' cut nigga, your nigga need a cut
If you gotta' hundred in your pocket nigga
your nigga need at least have fifty, know what I'm sayin?
niggaz that get in the rap
forget about them niggaz who helped 'em nigga
Keep it real nigga
So that's why I don't want to fuck with you new niggaz man
I ain't shootin marbles with you niggaz
But y'all cool

[Lil' Flip]
If it ain't Suckafree don't fuck wit me
Cause I know you got your eyes on my luxury
If you ain't Suckafree don't fuck with me
Cause I know you got your eyes on my luxury

[Chorus]",It's a Fact

But everybody tryna ride blades
Everybody want to ride candy paint

I came along way I went from Cutless to Benz
From Benz to Jag on twenty-three inch rims
From crack to macs from broke to sacks
From water guns, to bee-bees, from bee-bees to gats
From stamps to tatoos from home to school
Even though I made straight A's I still broke the rules
I came along way I went from no shows, to mo'shows
I went from Duck Head, to Girbaud, and Polo
They all said (""Flip you need to stop rapping"")
And now I'm rockin' 2 chains they say please stop cappin'
And I'm like what happened?I thought we was cool
But I gotta strong line so I'm like fuck you!

I'm all weed scented cause I blow like Snoop
And people think I'm flippin' birds
Cause I'm rollin' in a Coupe
And I'm smellin' like Juice wit 20 rocks on my tooth
Y'all doing the Harlem Shake we raise da roof
I sprayed the Coupe with ten coats of red
And just because blades are choppin' everybody dead
And I'm like the Exorcist cause I gotta turn a head
And we can't go on a date girl if you in the (red)
Cause I'll hit you in the head wit a mothafuckin' pillow
I'm a stay Sucka Free like my homie Big Mello (R.I.P)

I ain't ashamed of where I'm from baby I'm from the hood
And if you ask me how I'm doin' ""I'm a say I'm doin' good""
And I wish you would pull out a gat and try to jack
Cause I'm a do you like a egg nigga you gettin' cracked
I ain't ashamed of where I'm from baby I'm from the hood

All how ass nigga can't fuck with us
Fuck y'all watch out for my nigga Redd
Doing a show soon down in Nashville
In the studio that album coming soon",Look at Me Now [*]
Lil' Flip,"In elementary I used crayons, even chalk
I learned to count money before I could read and talk
And my mama told me son, you need to shine
I couldn't stand at the back, I had to lead the line
I use to make good grades, but I talked in class
In middle school I was late when I walked in class
I the teacher ran a aron, I taught the class
And what I didn't know, I was about to ask
And just because I played ball, I got easy grades
And when I turned 13, I got even fades
Everybody wearing Air Macs, Ree's and J's
But all my parents cared about, was be	's and A's
In high school, I picked up my pen and pad
I had dreams, of pulling up in a Benz or Jag
I had to get it on my own, I couldn't depend on dad
I had to grow up too fast, but then I'm glad
Because the stuff I know now, I wouldn't believe it
The main goals that I set, I wouldn't achieve it
I'd probably be locked up, or running the streets
I'd probably wouldn't have platinum, in front of my teeth
I'd probably still be mocking, trying to earn a dollar
I'd probably be in the hood selling sherm or powder
But instead, I'm making bread legal dough
Going to church and staying away from these evil hoes

You only got one life,  you better do what you can
'Cause when you turn thirteen, you are a man
And I can't be broke so I'ma rock the crowd
It's up to me, I gotta make my mama proud

You only got one life,  you better do what you can
'Cause when you turn thirteen, you are a man
And I can't be broke so I'ma rock the crowd
It's up to me, I gotta make my mama proud

There's a place called heaven and a place called hell
There's a place called freedom and a place called jail
And if you go to jail, they gone treat you bad
Take your commissary, and beat you bad
So I'm staying out of trouble, I'm chasing my dream
I know you see your little boy on t.v. screens
I'm blowing up, your little boy making it happen
I'm not selling dope mama, I'm making it rapping
So when you go to sleep at night, you know I'm safe
Cause in Houston everyday somebody catching a case
Like yesterday, my partner went to jail
And he ain't coming home until he fifty seven
He nineteen, so you do the math
I got smart, man, I choose to rap
So when I grow up, my kids can have a good life
That's all I wrote, y'all have good night

You only got one life,  you better do what you can
'Cause when you turn thirteen, you are a man
And I can't be broke so I'ma rock the crowd

Lil' Flip, Bizzy Bone
(First Eazy, Houston Texas
Then Pac, then Biggie
And now it's Big Pun
Now DJ Screw, Aaliyah)

(Chorus: Repeat 2X)
And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died

You still my nigga, my nigga, my niggas
I met Screw in 9-4 at a Fat Pat show
Back when Club Unique, use to be stadium bowl
I walked up to his car with a cassette in my hand
Then I freestyled for him 'cause this could be my only chance
Me and my partner Jason, we started doing mix tapes
We both smiled cause we knew this could be our big break
Then Screw wrote his number down and said hit him next week
Get your list together, and pick all your beats
Well time went by and my best friend died
Rest in peace Jason dog I wish your ass was alive
A couple months later, my second cousin passed
So that made me sit down and realize what I had
I dropped ""Diamonds In Yo Face"" and ""Buy The Car, Buy The House""
And Screw saw me at a show and said boy you went off
Two hours later, I was making tapes at his house
And didn't nobody go to sleep until the mics went off

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

I'm still on earth, and everything ter-rific
Pour me a spot, so we can reunite and kick it
People don't understand life, but one day you'll get it
But for now you better enjoy your one way ticket
And Screw, I want to thank you for the help you gave me
We had a relationship like Lil Wayne and Baby
The day you gave me the plack saying Screwed Up Click
The Freestyle King forever is Lit-tle Flip
You let me rip, the mic while you was scratching and mixing
I wasn't trying to run shit I just played my position
We stood in the kitchen smoking, laughing and sipping
Getting high, me and you eating a basket of chicken
Before we shot fool you said Flip come get a ass whipping
I ain't gone lie, Screw could shoot with one hand without missing
I'm on a mission, I'm trying to Screw up the world
Lil' Flip gone hold it down baby that's my word

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

Now the last verse, I ain't even got to curse
I'm use to seeing your Impala not you riding in a hearse
You set a trend, that'll never be forgotten
Just imagine Batman if he didn't have Robin
But I learned a lot, and I'm glad I'm in a click
And please believe, I still drop underground hits
I got your name tatted on me with a crown on top
You probably DJ'ing up there for Biggie Smalls and Pac


[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga",R.I.P. Screw
Lil' Flip,"Well, I smoke and lean tryna get high
On Cloud 9 tryna reach they sky
We call it dro', ya'll call it lye
All I need is a sweet to get me by

I'm super fly like Missy
Drink Moette until I'm pissy
I pulled up in a Bentley
Hoes asking, ""Who is it?"", It's F L I P

Blowing that light green
No sticks, no seeds 300 dollars for an O-Z
And you know me stay blowed puffing and passing
You split it, dump it, lick it then stuff it wit hashing

Da roof, da roof, da roof is on fire
We don't need matches real smokers use lighters
Da roof, da roof, da roof is on fire
We don't need matches real smokers use lighters

Smoke all day that's what I do
When I think about my nigga Screw
I break bread with my crew
I smoke green, purple, even blue

I don't know about you but I love to smoke
Play Grand Theft and crack a joke
Or go to the club and snatch a hoe
That's the way it go when ya ballin' hoe

We smoke dro' to get higher
I got 20's on my tires, I got tensions in my wires
'Cause Haddy's got that fire
And when I retire, I'm a still be smoking hay
Like or mail man and Drey
([Unverified])

So if you wanna smoke something just holla at ya boy
'Cause I got cotton candy, tarantula and fat boy
We can roll a sack boy and get so high
But when it's time to hit the club, I need Visine for my eyes

You want to F-L-I-P with S-E
L-I-F-E, Flip with Seville tonight - [2x]

[Lil' Flip]
You ain't got to stereotype me because I'm a rapper
Cause after every show I be on another chapter
Not running to them hoes, but I'm running to my do'
Cause when I make money I don't shine, I just glow
If I don't work, then I don't eat
So I'm not tricking cause I'm looking for the treats
And if you play it right girl we could take it far
How bout walking in the park, rolling in my Jaguar

[Chorus: Seville]
You know you got me hypnotized up, sliding them thighs up 
Get ready to slide up, open you wide up tonight
You know you got me hypnotized up, sliding them thighs up 
Get ready to slide up, open you wide up tonight

[Lil' Flip]
I wonder if I broke both arms would you right a flow for me
If a girl scratched my car would, you fight a hoe for me
Go out of town and go get the dough for me
If I can't buy weed, would you grow for me
If I go to jail will you come and get me out
If a nigga got tickets, would you go and set it off
I don't know but I'ma find out, that's what I want to know
Cause I'm looking for a girl, I'm not looking for a hoe
Everyday I got a show, but I don't fuck around
And a nigga making money as soon as I touch the town
I'm a million dollar star, with a million dollar car
We could get in the jacuzzi and blow a cigar
With some hash in it, six car garage with some Jags in it
Nigga got a trunk, and I got ten bags in it
Went to buy some Gucci and some Prada
And niggas know I'm a leader Lil' Flip will never follow, holla

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
I was lying, about taking a walk in the park
But girl I got some weed, where's the lighter let's spark
I'll tell you bout me, you tell me about you
And if you play it right I might start calling you boo
Got to cook for a nigga, write a hook for a nigga
If you say the law's coming, then look for a nigga
Cause a nigga need a gal, who's a ride or die chick
Excuse my french, I need a ride or die bitch

[Seville]
All I want to do is come, inside 
Girl tonight I want to make you feel alright
Ooh baby girl you feel so tight tonight
I like, I like, I like

I'm Lil' Flip, I'm back on the scene, freestyle king
Brand new piece, same byzentine
I'm still sippin lean, I'm still watchin ""Scream""
I love wearin platinum, but my favorite color's green
I'm hoppin out Ferraris, my house is three stories
I'm still independent cause Jive couldn't afford me
The meetings were boring, for real I was snoring
The VP was fine, yeah she made me kinda horny
But that's another story, let's get back to the topic
Right now me and Hump negotiatin to buy the Rockets
We might buy the Comets - name it, I done it
If you see it, and want it, buy it, own it
This is for my homies, Pat and DJ Screw (Screw)
R.I.P. dawg cause I really miss you
Boy I'ma stay true, until the day I fall
East coast and West coast, this is how we ball

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I'm thinkin - designer clothes and fashion shows
I'm thinkin - all my albums goin platinum and gold
I'm thinkin - Jaguars and a Bentley Rolls
I'm thinkin - bein rich before I'm 24
I'm feelin - wood grain all in my tinted truck
I'm fillin - all my teeth up with princess cuts
I'm fillin - jugs up, no mo empty cups
I'm feelin - like I'm worth 10 million bucks
And I know - I wear a watch, yo it was made from a game
And I know - my rims chop like the blades on a plane
And I know - yo baby mama still givin me brain
And I know - that ain't platinum, that's a silvery chain
And I make - nothin but hits when I step in the booth
And I make - rainbows from the sun reflect on my tooth
And I make - DVD's light up in my coupe
I think I feel I know I make money, how bout you?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I'm swangin, about to rip the kizzerp, sippin on my syzzerp
If you buy first from me then you just bought a dizzert
Swangas on my whizzeel, platinum in my grizzeel
Me and Doby D stay blowin on some kizzeel

Southside of H-town show me how you fizzeel
Now you see we ball, now you see we rich
I represent the legendary Screwed Up Click
I wreck I-45, I wreck 2 Screw tapes
I'm 3 wheelin, poppin trunk, goin down Fuqua
So move out of my way cause I'm ridin double are

And try to bust and when you think we ain't for playa hating
We ain't scared, and just because we
Serious, mysterious and curious

You niggas acting like hoes, wearing eachother clothes
Bragging about platinum, nigga that's white gold
Fake niggas talk, and real niggas hush
Fake niggas run, and real niggas bust
why'all got me fucked up, I been a street nigga
And when it's cold outside, I bring my heat nigga
Don't beef with me nigga, cause I get down and dirty
I make a call at one o'clock, you gone by one-thirty
Nigga I ain't scared I pack, infrareds
My enemies like batteries, half of em dead
You heard what I said, I'm down with trigga play
Cause all you see in convicts and killas, where I stay
I know Hump, got my front and Redd, got my back
I know Bizzy, got a tech and I'm coming with a mac
So start riding your wheel, we coming with the steal
And it's a fact, that most niggas mouth get em killed

We ain't scared, believe me we got a lot to say
And if you see me in the club with a smile on my face
That don't mean shit cause I got a nine on my waist
So you can play Superman and get your ass paralyzed
Cause when it comes to my guns, they all super-sized
You better recognize we ain't Sucka Free for nothing
So when I say I'ma get you, you know I ain't bluffing
Cause niggas turn into hoes when you pull a gun out
And if I pull a gun out, I'm trying to knock a lung off
Now who the boss, nigga you already know
I got a team of headbusters, where ever I go
And if you got beef let me know I'm ready for war
I got a semi-automatic that'll machete your car
And next time you talk down, I'ma teach you a lesson
So call mama, and tell her she gone need her a reverend, what

Some of these niggas is dinosaurs abducted like flying saucers
Niggas don't think like that, lick it down, on my alters
The most of my grave suite, model mama, put em up now

Tupac to Bob Marely, my six the holley Halle Berry touching my braids
They ain't giving justice's name killing em black bald and all

Pick up your Mac 10 quickly and bring the pain
One in the brain, one in the body it's an everyday thang

Lil' Flip,"Hi, this is the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
Today we're interviewing Lil' Flip (what's up man)
So Lil' Flip tell me, how long have you been rapping
(man I've been rapping ever since)...

[Lil' Flip]
1995, I was in junior high
I saw a lot of shit, so I was glad to be alive
A lot of people died, but a lot of people here
And when I turned 15, my vision got clear

It's time to be a man, time to make a plan
It's cool to make a hundred, but it's best to make a grand
My Granny got sick, and then they found cancer
We got to pay the doctors, but God got the answer

The surgery went good, my Granny doing well
My baby on the way so I can't go to jail
And to my niggas on the block, stop selling rocks
'Cause I'm a tell the truth you can't outsmart the cops

You see what I did, I only drop hits
Chopping up game, why'all chopping up bricks
And some niggas snitch, cause they can't take the heat
How we gone go buy a system when the system got his beat

[Young Redd]
Hey, I'm from the home of the Astros, home of the Rockets
Born to rap yo, with a microphone in my pocket
Always thought I was grown, you couldn't tell me nothing
I would talk shit if you tried to tell me something

But I regret that, I had some minor setbacks
Old people thought my future would be jet black
All my years growing up, I thought life was a game
You can't make it real far, thinking life is a game

Yeah we lost a couple of friends, I almost lost my brother
I don't know what would of happened if we lost eachother
Everyday is something new, I just take it in stride
You only got one life, so enjoy the ride

Sometimes I was paid, sometimes I was broke
Me and Gray started hustling but my mama didn't know
But it's cool, cause now I'm into this music
The man gave us a gift and we loving to use it

And if you look real close you'll see
That you can only be you, and I can be me
'Cause can't nobody ever live my life but me
But you will never see what I see like me huh me

[Chorus: x 2]
And you don't know what I've been through
So you shouldn't judge me
And you don't know what I will and I won't do
So you shouldn't judge me

[Lil Ron]
It's getting harder now I just don't understand
Why the people in the world disgrace the black man
All that I could say, is pray and let it be
Little right and try your best not to end up like me

See I was the nigga that slang dope and steal cars
Glad I stopped before it led behind bars
Heart aches and scars, help me feel my way
Understand today I got a decision to make

Now do I want to live right or continue going wrong
I'm never at home this music keep a nigga gone
But this is what gets me, who are you to judge
'Cause I'm young and black, people still hold a grudge

Just a nudge right now'd push me over the end
When I was 14 I lost a very close friend
And ever since then my life ain't been the same
That's the biggest reason why I had to make a change

[Lil' Flip]
Never judge a book by it's cover, a man by his wealth
And if you already on your feet why don't you help somebody else
This what I was taught, so that's what I live by
'Cause you can't take none of this shit with you when you die

So everyday I try, to keep my head high
But these bird ass niggas always jump fly
Should I take em out the game, naw I'ma use my brain
I'm a kill em with kindness, and blow up my name

I came from nothing, and now I got a little change
A nigga happy now but I went through some pain
And everyday it rain, there's gone be some sunshine
I never thought I could put my whole life in one rhyme

[Chorus: x 2",What I Been Through

Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

[Al-D]
Gripping on grain, while the 15's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[K-Rino]
Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]

Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter
Down South, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

Sexy ladies, goin' crazy, cause the beat's like whoa whoa whoa

[Lil' Kim]
Fresh out the federal building
To Bentley Coupes with the convertible ceilings
It's the black widow, call me Miss White
I done been through it all, shootouts and fistfights

Crooklyn bitch, you go wrong I get right
Back with a classic, now gimme six mics
Can't reach me on the phone, then send a bitch a kite
Man I do's it in heels or a pair of crisp Nikes

Stand behind Martin Luther King, but I'm more like Malcolm X
Guerillas beatin on they chest, get it right on Malcolm X
Just keep the peace, cause if cowards show me disrespect
My niggaz put his soul to rest and I don't wanna see you stressed

Champagne at my campaign, Kim for mayor
Told you I'm the same bitch from the escalator
And I ain't trippin off you rats and investigators
Get your envelopes, time to address the haters

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Me and my team, we tryin' to own casinos
So we can all cop dreams like Pacino's
Come through in the oh-six Benz-itos
The feds tryin' to shut us down like Nino

We keep it goin man, we keep it goin' man
Won't stop, can't gotta keep it goin' man
See I do it for the fans, they'll never understand
While they goin' off course, me I'm stickin' to the plan

Feel the movement, it's a whole new crew
Fuck Junior M.A.F.I.A., that chapter is through
Them faggots done did somethin' that they can't undo
Whoever ridin' with 'em they can get one too

Could a copped to a one to three do
Still took it to trial, even though I blew
Crooklyn style, that's how we do it
I'll gangsters and ain't got to prove it

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Now a party ain't a party 'til the Queen come through
You know where I go, man the team come too
Pull up in the Phantom or the V-1-2
Lil' Kim's that girl, even got her own shoe

In the club with my clique though, glass full of Crist-al
In the jail jumpsuit, still a bad bitch though
Rose from the ghetto it was hard from the get go
Then I showed the hood the world ain't just made for rich folk

Get ya little dance up, BK stand up
Straight to the dance floor, everybody hands up
Throw it up, get down, fellas hold your pants up
Ladies throw it right back, tell that nigga man up

[Chorus]",Whoa
Lil' Flip,"You are now rockin' wit The Symphony

Yes sir
It's ya boy Fliperachi the number one fly boy (yeah)
I'm the building wit my girl Mya (fo' sho)
You know we doin' a song for the ladies, they want records too, you know
So if you want to come kick it wit some real pimp, a real man, a young boss
Girl money don't run out
Let me holla if you down wit Clover G's (fo' sho)

[Chorus]
I know that you'd take care of me, baby please (that's right, that's right)
No baby is not jealousy, jealousy

The first day we met, I was in my vet
I just left Warner Brothers pickin' up my check (ha ha)
I pulled up in Wing Stop just to get me a bike
Rubber cush on my blunt so I'm high as a kite
Red monkeys wit a crist twelve hundred to pop
And when you walk by I couldn't do nothin' but watch
Cause I know you wit a cat who ain't treatin' you right
And if you wanna be happy you should leave him right now
I got a ten o'clock flight on my G-5 girl
Let me upgrade you, no more Levi's girl
I'm a show you finer thangs you can cruise the world
And when we come back you gon' have bluest purse
Yes sir

[Chorus]

I ain't a pimp no more, that was '99 (99)
Cause when it came to the bread I had to get mine
Top down when I'm roll up the Vegas Strip
Four pound on my hip in case a nigga trip
A hundred dollar chips, let's gamble ma (let's go)
And if the crowd get thick let's scramble ma (let's go)
No gal can cook shrimp better than ma (ha ha)
I had a gal ain't know what berretta or nine
After this, I'm a drop ""Ahead of My Time""
The true thangs that I love is my bread and my dyme
They be like ""Flip man you got a lazy flow""
That's when I say ""oh well, I make crazy dough""
Chuch chuch

[Chorus]

You always say the things to make me stay
He then told me that you would change your ways
You always got the best from me
I gave 'em to you faithfully
I'm flippin' now I gotta get away

So come and roll wit a fly boy
You can be my fly girl
Just you and I girl
The kid ballin' like Jim Jones (ballin')
Cause I made about 8 million ring tones (ballin')
I'm a certified mack in the streets
How many rappers got ice on the back (but they not too many)
I do it big like that rapper from ?
While you exit home put your ring out (ha ha)
And we on private jets sippin' real wine
I was in the projects watchin' feds crime
But now I'm doin' projects gettin' paid now (yeah)
There go the paparazzi go and put your head down (cheese, cheese)

[Verse One]
Ah shit, why'all done fucked up and let me in this bitch
I'm just your average hood nigga with dreams of gettin' rich (But you don't hear me)
My crib big like a football field (football field)
You might fuck around and think I signed a football deal (But you don't hear me)
I take 15 minutes to drop a track (yeah)
I take half a minute to load my gat (But you don't hear me)
I make 'em gloss all across the globe
I'm a pimp, I got your hoe takin' off her clothes (But you don't hear me)
A franchise like a Houston Rocket (Houston Rocket)
Every eight months is when I usually drop it (But you don't hear me)
I got the streets on lock, I like my beats with knock
You know my heat stay cocked, niggaaaaa

[Verse Two]
Look, I'm a Christal nigga and you a red-winer
You just an opening act, but I'm the headliner (But you don't hear me)
I'm 'bout to ship 3 mill' off top
You got your deal off your man, I got my deal off props (But you don't hear me)
I'm connected like dub and Mach-10 with ice cubes in my watch
And dubs on the black Benz (But you don't hear me)
I'm getting' paid 'cause I do all the work
It's rainy days if we don't move all our work, we go bizirk (But you don't hear me)
I'm on the block fam, in the cream drop Lam
Mostly our cats with deals, why'all ain't hot man (But you don't hear me)
I'm 'bout to do it again, you 'bout to lose it again
It's show and tell motherfucker, I'm a prove it again

[Chorus: x 4]

The game over, 'cause shit about to change over
It's 'bout time 'cause hip-hop need a make over (But you don't hear me)
If most producers want to charge too much
But around my way that's how you get fucked up (But you don't hear me)
You might think we all beats and rhymes
But way before this rap shit, nigga, the streets was mine (But you don't hear me)
I got that hot shit, that ""Thug Life"" 'Pac shit
That get hot shit, that B.I.G. ""Ready to Die"" shit

kiss the ring 'cause now I'm on some dumb shit

and I don't know about you but I ain't hurtin'

I'm stepping out with Air Max with the regular laces

Shorty I will flip this stuff until the task force came
Tried to rearrange the game, tried to bang, I suck at slanging

New slang I had to switch it up, wrap a pimp cursing on the track

The mack will leave you on your back, strap will leave you with
 a gap
Stop smiling! - glances you see visions of the past
You see niggaz with masks, up in cars with no tags
When we balling! - I'm from the apartments, started with all of
 it
Different day same clip, so close I can't miss
Tity, Flip, Ludacris, got bricks, roosters, chicks
Snatching bread then we dip, it's South Side - represent!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now the clique is called D.T.P. so get your crew right
We peer pressure fools, even +Dudley+ don't +Do-Right+
So go on your city, it's a South rebellion
We putting ""foots"" in your asses, how we speak Australian?
I'm trained in the art of whoop ass, check my accolades
Got a knife and I'm giving out free after shaves
Plus a new acting gig, take a look at the CLIP!
It's called one up in the chamber and four on the HIP!
I snatch your girls in the club and use them as throat throttles

Got glocks for your stocks and that thing for your chain
And uh, mutual guns for your mutual funds main!

Lil' Flip,"I thank god everyday 
For paving the way 
Cause he made me what I am today 
A young entrepreneur with amazing talent 
In order 2 be	 the best you must take the challenge
I'm trying 2 be	 number 1 cause number 2 don't matter 
People trying 2 pull you down when you climb the ladder
Hate 2 see you up but they love it when you down 
That's why I'm always quiet when I come around
cause talk is cheap that's why I rap 
I'm getting NBA money with no salary cap 
Mama it feels good to put money in your mailbox
This for my niggas locked up in the cell blocks

[Chorus 2x]
Cause the sun don't shine 
That's why I spit these rhymes
To ease my mind
For real I got to get away 

In life you go through drama and pain 
And when someone close dies it'll give you a migraine
And a whole lot of stress, a whole lot of tears
The days turn into nights, the nights turn into years
I'm not happy here, I'm on another atmosphere 
I got to get away just to get my mind clear 
That's why I smoke so much it relieves my stress
Just imagine everyday I got to wear my vest 
I got to watch my back 
Cause niggas hiding the jack
When you see these moving you like fuck you feel that 
To all my niggas in jail you better keep your head up 
To my niggas in the hood you better keep your bread up 

[Chorus 2x]
Cause the sun don't shine 
That's why I spit these rhymes
To ease my mind
For real I got to get away 

If I died today I have lived my life
And if I could do it again Id do it twice
No more moving white or shooting dice
Or creeping late night trying to screw your wife
Cause I'm a changed man with the heart of a lion 
Even if I was a midget id be fighting a giant 
Ill never give up I'm from the home of the braves
I'm still ballin like pac from the cradle to the grave

Tryna get off they G-pack, I'm from the ??
Haters ain't never stop me yet

It's $5.00 a pop in the hood for some cigarettes
Where I'm from niggaz'll pop up where you rest
Where I'm from it's too much for a man to digest
Where I'm from niggaz lose sleep and get no rest

Where I'm from we aim shoot at ya neck (where I'm from)

Where I'm from I run with a pack
Of killers and ex con's that'll run in ya drought
Them three bricks right there they come with them rats

I'm the same young nigga dumpin the gat
I'm the same young nigga that'll jump out the 'Lac

This sixteen bars of my brain, I show my scars through my pain
I write my bars on the plane, I bring my boys on the plane
There's nothing like it, I swear
Can't no other rappers compare
Cause I can spit it or write it
Just admit it, you like it
I'm the hottest around
Niggaz know how I get down
But this ain't Making The Band
I'm tired of shaking your hand
I got the piece to the puzzle, I'm on the streets when I hustle
I got the heat with the muzzle, Okay (Okay)
You think you know it all, but I proove to show it all
When I move, you get one shot, hope you don't blow it, dog
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
You just a lukewarm, bookworm nigga and believe me, I can read you
I'm tired of snakes and rats, I'm moving forward, you pacing back
While I'm in N.Y. collaborating, blazing tracks
You gotta face the fact, I got the only platinum plaque
I did it well, even when I'm gone, my shit'll sell

Straight from the projects, I'm still cased up with charges

[Z-Ro:]
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus
My only love was for extras, and overs
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas

[Hook: x2]
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads

[P.O.P.:]
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so

[Hook x2]

[Bun B:]
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B

I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word, it's just you and me

But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

Lil' Flip,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful
Every man want to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done?  it's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand man universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!
You can't hold god's people back that long
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You just lost one

This for the block, there's no place like show business
Hell naw nigga, I'm serious

Take this muh'fuckin' rap money
And bring it back to the block nigga
Haha, fo' real, so if you gettin yo money

You know, I'm just worried about me now
Got all the fuck boys from around me, hey fuck you niggas
Hey, now let's get it

[Chorus]
After I do my concert, I bring that money to the block
And nigga I don't half, cause I want the whole block
Now whip it, now whip it, now whip it, now whip it
Now get it, whip it, ship it, and flip it

[Verse 1]
Ay I told you muh'fuckers I'ma bounce back
With three million in cash, potna count that
If I write you a check, nigga you can cash that
And when I'm in Europe, I use my flatstack
The black car get used fo' times a day
My rims skinny, but my pockets overweight
Go get yo tubes tied, cause you a bitch boy
800 grand, and now you think you rich boy
You better step it up, my paper been straight
And by the way my new chick go to Penn Stae
I paid for her car, I paid for her books
Okay I'm lyin, but don't that shit go with the hook
I got money to blow, I oughta be ashamed
I'm playin with some change, I want Travolta plane
He got a couple of 'em, we always fuck with rubbers
This ain't O.G. kush, I like to call it Bubble

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ay fuck boy, I'm the James Toney of rap
Cause niggas hate me, but I still got it like that
A brand new 'Vette, I'm a ladies man
Plus my Bretlin cost me 80 grand
Ay, money ain't a thang, you know where I hang
And besides music, you know what I slang
And you know what I claim, It's Clover Geez up
And don't you hate it when yo potna smoke, all yo weed up?
I had to roll my sleeves up (why?), cause of my bracelet
And we ain't goin nowhere, so just face it
I lace weed with the syrup cause it burn slow
I make G's with my words cause it earn dough
Who woulda known Lil' Flip 'll scan five mil'
And then be forced to take a break for two years
But the block got love for the God
So you know it ain't shit for me to get a nigga robbed

[Verse 1:]
I got a brand new 'Mac I hope this bitch don't jam
I had to bulletproof the Lam, I learned that from Cam
You want a thang got em yams go straight to Money Gram
I'm from the hood, so you know I'm down wit any money scam
Black glocks, white glocks spit like sheet rock
You know a drank on me, this concert gon' stop
A lot of cops at the scene tryin' to shut shit down
You was a nobody, but now you famous now
I be out in Chi-town wit some real OG's
Matter of fact one of them had dinner wit me
You gotta play by the rules when you on these streets
You lil' niggas tryin' to mimic what you see on beef
You betta

[Hook:]
Bustaclip [repeatedly w/ Lil' Flip ad libs]
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
You don't wanna beef wit meee

[Verse 2:]
I know some Long Beach Crips (fo' reeeall?)
I know some Englewood Bloods (bloods)
And you can ask ??? fans I got Cali love (love)
I got a strap waitin' for me everytime I land
Just to send you a message, I'll clap your man
Now he under white sheets like the Klu Klux Klan
You lil' boys shouldn't beef wit a grown ass man
I got stripes in the hood, I put in work fo' real
And mentioning me, will get you put in dirt fo' real
How much that gramma yay, bitch you carry weigh
Cause I'm on this Alize and I carry cake
I came back to the streets I had to let y'all know
And by the way my new deal worth 8.4
So I'mma

[Hook:]
I'm strapped nigga
I'm strapped nigga
I'm strapped nigga, what about you?

[Verse 3:]
This for my Nap-town niggas all my G-town killas
The ones wit the blow and them 18 wheelers
Cross the state lines wit it on them waist line cocked
Cross lope and you know it's goin' doowwnnn (like Yung Joc)
40 cal, 50 cal, what you workin' wit nigga?
I'm in a Maserati what you swervin' in nigga?
And when I'm out in Cleveland, I'm fuckin' wit X
It's been 'bout 5 years he still holdin' my tech
I be in the gun range like everyday
You betta pray no drama ever come my way
I'm in the studio now wit a gun on my hip
And I'm tired talkin' 'bout the beef wit me and
You betta

[Lil' Flip: Talkin']
This some shit for the street baby
We bust a clip everyday

When I feel like it nigga
Track And Productions on the muthafuckin' track
Full Effeck is the muthafuckin' future
Cross them niggas, I shoot you nigga
Any nigga, who got a gun and a chain nigga
And that dough, that's a true d-boy
Can't be a dope boy without a gun and a chain
Make sure you got them extra clips nigga
But on the real nigga, don't hate on a nigga when you see me pull up on that Maserati
I'm done wit the muthafuckin' Maybach
Fuck that shit nigga, I'm on some drop top flashy ""Flash Gordon"" type shit
Biatch, BUSTACLIP!
",Bustaclip
Lil' Flip,"[Chorus]
Tell me why I can't see where I'm goin(No)
When everybody else see's,where I'm comin from
And I don't know why I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around-and find my way home

When you listen to my music do you feel my shit
Look I don't need punchlines cause I live my shit
A lot of cats selling they soul for radio play
That's why we need mo' rappers like Common and Kayne
Niggas scared to be broke so they fake it,to make it
If my album went gold I'd still be the greatest
Back in the days I would get caught for trulency
But now I'm puttin' money back in my community
I took my homies out the hood now they got jobs
Cause it's more to life then dodgin' cop cars
I played the block hard,now I play the pop charts
Now I'm gettin' dumb money,cause I got smart

[Chorus]

Ayo I never seen a man cry,till I seen a man die
So when you talk to me look me in my damn eyes
Cause I been through it all and my scars prove it
Cause when it come to that paper homie I'm a do it
I just rhyme part time you better know it
These lines comin' from my mind so I never wrote it
Keep my nine by my spine so I never show it
Yeah I'm addicted to pine but I never grow it
And the reason I got signed cause I'm a poet
Half of my niggas doin' time but I'm focused
That's why I'm stayin' on my grind if you haven't noticed
That old Cadillac transformed to a Lotus

[Chorus]

When ya new album drop everybody ya friend
Niggas actin' like they down but I know they pretend
I use to scrap up money for studio time
I'm like Jay Z homie I remember my rhymes
Ain't nobody help me out when my cash was low
Bills comin' too fast so I had to blow
And I walked by faith,not by sight
Cause I know G-O-D will guide me right
I take the bitter with the sweet,I know you feel my pain
Why we gotta get harassed when we board the plane
I ain't tryna preach to you but I hope you relate
Even at a dead end you gotta find yo' way (Okay,Okay)

[Chorus]

I wanna dedicate this track here to my grandparents
Ya know they stuck with me through thick and thin
Ya knah' I'm sayin' since day one,without my family
Ya know I ain't got no back bone man
So I dedicate this to you and pray to God you goin' find a way, holla back",Find My Way

Drinking beer, shooting dice at school
When most niggas had a nine to five shit
On the block, we making nine to five grand
Each day, yeah, we got cheap yay (holla)

The hood hot like a crock pot
Dope fiends cutting yards for a twenty piece of crack rock
Around my way, ain't nobody watching Matlock
We tryin' to hot wire cars and break pad locks
Turn soft to hard, drop it in Glad locks
And drive flashy cars, and get mad props
And still I won't change
Last week they caught my partner with a block of 'caine
And can't no amount of money stop the pain
They gave him thirty-five years 
His momma went insane

Leaving home wearing pants
Then change into a skirt

[Hook w/ Lil' Flip adlibs]

[Verse 3 - Lil' Flip]
I told niggas I show niggas, I'm the best
I'm the shit in New York, but I'm a God on the West (holla!)
I must confess, 'The Source' own me two more mics (hey I need two more mics)
I took my ringtone money and bought two more bikes
I took my liquor money (yeah)
And bought another crib (yeah)
I got three maids (yeah)
That is that fuckin' game
Go ask Corn Row (ask him)
We do it big right? (right)
If I ain't front row, I ain't watchin' the fight (fuck it)
I be in Street Port wit my nigga Bayday ??
I be in airports wit my fuckin' AK (shut up!)
4-7 to 11, 1-8-7 on a cop
I know you prayin' that I flop, niggaaa!

",I Get Money
Lil' Flip,"I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

Many nights you waited up but I never called back
And every time I had a show I would tell you to fall back
I know you think I got chicks in every state
I know my lifestyle fast but I'ma pump my breaks

At the beginning everythang was cool
I used to leave the studio and pick you up from school
You was there when I had to eat Ramon noodles
If you ain't careful stress is what the game'll do ya

I got the world on my shoulders
That's why I lace my girl with a Clover
I know you worried 'cause I stay in the streets, ma
But don't worry 'cause I roll thirty deep, ma, I'm good

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

At first it was restaurants then the movies
Now you typing crazy messages in my two-way
But it's time though I meet a million hoes
But they ain't like you 'cause they ain't got pretty toes

You know thugs never let their feelings show
But anytime you wanna talk just let me know
'Cause I got your back, we a perfect match
It's me and you against the world, who's stopping that?

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

I like to see you with no make-up on
I like to see you with a Jacob on, now do your thang, girl
If you wanna get to know me just holla, girl
Have you ever rode in a drop top Impala, girl?

I could turn a good girl into a bad girl
I got you rocking black ice, no more black pearls
I can't lie, I want your body in the worst way
I fly to Cali in the morning, I'll be back Thursday

",I Just Wanna Tell U
Lil' Flip,"Oh, oh, oh, ha, ha
You know what this is right? This the real hip hop
None of that watered down shit you used to
Rest in peace Big L, rest in peace Big Pun
Rest in peace Left Eye and rest in peace Aaliyah

It was all a dream, the fancy limousines had me on a paper chase
Back befo' Snoop Dogg beat his murder case
I used to jam Run D.M.C
Monie Love, MC Lyte, and Biz Markie

When LL was bad with that gold rope phone
Back when niggas used beepers, now we got mobile phones
Me and my homies used to battle at the park
We had to be back on our street by the time it got dark

We used to wear cross colors now we love Guess
""6 minutes your on"" like Dougie E. Fresh
I'm capable, I'm makin? dough like Puffy did
But this ain't happen overnight, trust me kid

Now e'rybody wanna spit 16
And live the glamorous life on the T.V. screen
But it ain't that easy, y'all rappers cheesy
I can't leave rap alone my fans need me

This the real hip hop
(Ay, you know we miss you 'Pac and Biggie)
This the real hip hop
(Ay, when I'm on stage my niggas rockin? with me)

This the real hip hop
(Ay, this time around I need five mics)
This the real hip hop
(?Cause my whole album ain't about ice)

Huh, back in the days, cool Herc was DJin?
But nowadays e'rybody instant replayin?
Ain't nobody scratchin? now
?Cause e'rybody goin platinum now

I'm a Nigga with a attitude like Cube and them
I got fame when I start fuckin? with Screw and them
Freestylin? on tapes for eight minutes straight
Pick a beat, rap to it, get another out the crate

Thanks to hip hop I got a whole lot of cake
I'm like these rappers actin? like they move a whole lot of weight
But wait, in my state I'm considered the great
And I refuse to pay for radio play

Rest in peace Justo, we gon? miss you dog
I know Jam Master Jay and Screw with you dog
They'll never be a DJ better than y'all
And by the way, rest in peace 'Pac and Biggie Smalls, yeah

This the real hip hop
(Ay, you know we miss you 'Pac and Biggie)
This the real hip hop
(Ay, when I'm on stage my niggas rockin? with me)

This the real hip hop
(Ay, this time around I need five mics)
This the real hip hop
(?Cause my whole album ain't about ice)

This the real hip hop

Lil' Flip,"Yeah-yeah-yeah, ay let's win a Grammy with this one
Let's go woo-woo, this for all the single mothers out there
Coming straight from your boy Fliperaci, the number one fly boy
I done took y'all to the club, I done took y'all to the streets
Fin to make you think, pay attention let's go

When we was kids, we wasn't worried about the bills
It was all about the ice cream, and rolling down hills
Look boy meets girl, the next day he wanna kiss
He make it to third base, but the condom wouldn't fit
And guess who bust in, the lil' girl's daddy
And you know black folks, he beat the lil' girl's ass
Now her stepmom mad, she like send her back
Cause I don't want my real daughter, growing up like that
I tired to tell you last year, when you bought that phone
And you don't know what she doing, when we ain't at home
In these days, the kids looking older now
So a grown man, might tap you on the shoulder now

This about a lil' mama too, if pop was here
I know it's hard to raise a child, and maintain a career
This a message, to all the single mothers in the world
(Don't be wasting all your time)
And if a coward get you pregnant, and he don't wanna help
Don't get stressed out, you can do it by yourself
Cause you a strong woman girl, enjoy your life
And no matter what they say, keep your head to the sky

Now it's eight years later, ery'body seventeen
But everything changed, since Kim left the scene
Now her laid back man, moving crackular
You want a ki, you gotta meet him at the back of the store
But guess who saw who, at the club that night
After exchanging phone numbers, somebody started a fight
Now ery'body running, so Kim ran with him
That's when she said you a playa, why you ain't leaving with them
That's when he said I want you, I been waiting for you
What you say we get a room, just me and you
After too much liquor, one thang led into another
But you know where he messed up, he told her he loved her

This about a lil' mama too, if pop was here
I know it's hard to raise a child, and maintain a career
This a message, to all the single mothers in the world

And if a coward get you pregnant, and he don't wanna help
Don't get stressed out, you can do it by yourself
Cause you a strong woman girl, enjoy your life
And no matter what they say, keep your head to the sky

Now it's two months later, that nigga disappeared
Meanwhile Kim at home, trying to wipe away her tears
Befo' she gave it up, he use to call daily
Another month passed by, now she going crazy
She popping up at clubs, she even keyed his car
That's when she got the phone call, bitch you went too far
Oh now you calling back, cause your car got scratched
You said you loved me, I can't believe I fell for that
Damn, I shoulda known you was a pig anyway
Look my stomach been hurting, and my friend kinda late
Wait, I took a test at least three or four times
But you know what cowards say, it ain't mine

And I know you tired, of hearing that man
A real man take responsibility, for his seeds
This for every single mother, whether you white or black
It don't matter, you know I'm saying
Everybody can't be born rich, you know I'm saying
I come from the hood, I made something out of nothing
You know I'm saying, everytime I do a concert
It's females in the front row, after the show
They like sign my autograph, so I can get back home
My kids gotta go to school, you know I'm saying
So if you taking care of your child, by your damn self
Keep doing your damn thang, if Fantasia can do the shit
Anybody can do it, you dig what I'm saying
Straight up, holla back",Single Mother
Lil' Flip,"Sorry, lil' mama, I gotta go
Not tryna' hit and run ya but I got another show

Give me them digits and a later date, I'll fuck with you some more

Meanwhile rollin' on chrome, every lil' mama
I run into wanna take me home
Tryna' give 'em all a fair share because they all want this bone
So don't get mad at me if my cell phone is on roam
I'm just tryna' get some dome

Yeah, now if you rollin' with me come now
I'm a gangsta I'll never put my gun down
I can't drive, girl, 'cause I'm high
I see ya belly ring plus you got a butterfly

Twenty eights when I roll out
Ten clear coats on my gold drop
What's yo name? Where you from, girl?
I got a presidential suite, you can come, girl

I got Cris by the case load
What the hell, ya ,baby, daddy in my face for?
Now I'm reachin' for my waist so
We got chicks in every state, woah

Sorry, lil' mama, I gotta go
Not tryna' hit and run ya but I got another show

Oh, she heard of rider gang, she wanna ride a gangsta
Ride with a gangsta, I'm a type of gangsta

It ain't 'bout the fame, she just diggin' my nature
It ain't 'bout the change, she said, ?I want the paper?
I'm feelin' ya style and ya classy ways
I want my child in ya stomach but not havin' my baby

Anyway I'm a one night stand man
And after this night I'm a dump you like a trash can
Like I set you on fire I can put you out
I was ya gas can and I can be ya water spout

So don't get mad at me if my cell phone is on roam

Yeah, I gotta Sprint and a T Mobile and a Nextel phone
And all three of 'em ringin' from bad ass bitches that wanna bone
Take one or two calls, take one to the telly and take one home
Cuttin' corners barely missin' the curb, tryin' not to break her bone

I'm sittin' on choppa eighty-threes and fresh ass meat
A nigga tried to jack me for 'em so I opened up his chest last week
I'm rude as a mothafucker but I get nice when I receive head
Might fall off for a minute but I get back right when I receive bread

Talk up on somethin' short and thick, go straight to the bed with it
But on the low, low 'cause someones always watchin' like a Fed visit
Crucify the coochie then cut a couple of corners
Cruisin' with me in the Bentley soon as I borrow ya

Sorry, lil' mama, I gotta go
Not tryna' hit and run ya but I got another show
It's already check out time plus my plane leaves at four
Give me them digits and a later date, I'll fuck with you some more

Meanwhile rollin' on chrome, every lil' mama
I run into wanna take me home
Tryna' give 'em all a fair share because they all want this bone
So don't get mad at me if my cell phone is on roam

Cause we get e'rybody high and leave the club drunk
Poppin' bottles, coppin' tiles, puttin' rims on it
I got mo' paper than you, I put my gems on it
How many rappers walk around rockin' three clovers
A German car but I got a Portuguese chauffeur
No penny loafers, I ain't Mike But I'm Bad nigga
And for that paper I'll get up in yo ass nigga
You too commercial, I'll hurt you and let that nine squirt you

I buy that shit you never knew existed
I hit the road and get paid, you come back home evicted, we stay ballin'

I only wear t-shirts, so fuck Prada
I used to have to win battles rhymin' on my turf
But now I'm walkin' around with diamonds in my shirt
Wrist glitted, car kitted, I'm so gutter
Even when it's Winter time I got fo' hustlers
But when you get rich that's when the snakes come
I had to figure out the real niggas from the fake ones
This rap shit got a nigga goin' overseas
But from Houston to Zurich we all smokin' weed
Them Clover Geez makin' moves while y'all standin' still
Nigga my fuckin' swimmin' pool cost a quarter mil'
Cause I'm a big mack, ridin in my big 'Lac
Like 3-57 with a little kick back
We miss you 2Pac, we miss you Biggie Smalls
Until we meet again, me and Yuk' gon ball, oh boy,oh boy

All my potnas got loot too, yeah
(Hell yeah we got loot too man, what you think?)
Said I'd rather ball with you
(You know we ballin' man, rose gold and platinum, what?)
And we flippin' new Benz Coupes, yeah

And we ridin' on 22's

Geah, geah, Yukmouth I'm Godzilla, ridin' with Lil' Flippa
Y'all rappers buyin' adapters we ridin' on real spinners
With goons and gorillas we ridin' with real killers
Cancun and the Villa, we playin' with real scrilla, nigga
I'm still ballin', flossin' and shot callin
Yuk' and Lil' Flip goin' show you who boss hoggin'
Y'all stompin' artist, all of my rocks flawless
Still get the whole club jumpin' like hydraulics
I spit the hottest flows, overseas rockin' shows
Still keep a flock of hoes at Roscoe's and Pappadeux
Rose gold and black diamonds is Rocky Road
Still aim, lock, and load, they'll kill you for some stop-n-go's
I rep the Westcoast, Flip represent the South
Shine with the down payment for a house in my mouth
I rock chains like Slick Rick in '82
Bentley Coupe navy blue,and still ball for DJ Screw

To check on my fam and buy my love bro throwbacks
I came a long way, it ain't my fault you went the wrong way
And listen up I'm grown nigga, I don't play
I got show money (yeah), plus liquor money (yeah)
After I get off stage I got picture money
These rap cats ain't stickin' to the G-code
You thing you fly cause you got a few free-throws
I know squares that cook O's, you damn right
And if you want it, you gotta pay the damn price
I do this for the dope boys with them A-K's
I'm a fly yellow nigga like Kay-Kay

Ay, you ain't gotta be fake I know y'all don't like me
Cause when I got shot up, y'all ain't right me
You got a chip on your shoulder, I got a clip in my holster
The difference between us, is I'm focused
Nowadays e'rybody wanna talk about me
But you know you can't mention the South without me
Record labels came, and record labels went
Pay attention to your checks, watch the money you spend
Your kids dirty, but you ride around in a Benz
Everyday at Pappadeux, trickin' ya ends
It ain't the color of our skin, that hold us back
It's a fact, niggas don't know how to act
A few niggas get paid e'rybody want a piece
Shit start goin' wrong e'rybody wanna leave
Record sales low e'rybody wanna beef
(No matter where I go) I keep it H double O-D

[Chorus: x2]

Ay, all my niggas makin' forty-five hunnid a week
We overseas blowin' trees, yeah it's somethin' to see
You'll never hear me say ""I don't need the hood""
All my niggas gettin' fat cause I feed the hood
It ain't my fault y'all niggas don't leave the hood
I did everything y'all ain't believe I could
Huh, you not ahead of me, I got longevity
I'm tryin' to leave my lil' boy, a legacy
I got the recipe, you wanna make a hit
You not impressin' me, talkin' bout bricks
I made it out the hood, and I'm still thuggin'
Accepted by Hollywood, and I'm still hustlin'
And that's a goddamn shame right?
Oh well, I'm tryin' to get my change right
And you'll survive, if you play the game right
I fly G-5's I ain't gotta change flights

At 15, I was makin' movies
Drinkin' beer, shootin' dice at school
When most niggas had a 9 to 5 shit
On the block, we makin' 9 to 5 grand

Each day, yeah, we got cheap yay
My niggas on lock, they called me on 3 way
The hood hot like a crock pot
Dope fiends cuttin' yards for a 20 piece of crack rock

Around my way ain't nobody watchin' 'Matlock'
We tryna hot wire cars and break padlocks
Turn soft to hard, drop it in Glad Locks
And drive flashy cars and get mad props

And still I won't change
Last week, they caught my patna with a block of caine
And can't no amount of money stop the pain
They gave him 35 years, his momma went insane, damn

But it's on TV everyday like they don't know that route
And lil' girls bein' fast, bein' grown, tryna flirt
Leavin' home wearin' pants, then change into a skirt

I live in the ghetto, I stay in the ghetto
Run up wrong, I'm sprayin' that metal
'Coz ain't shit sweet around my way
All I know is one thing, how to get paid

Because of me, they respect H-town
Look, I was here when y'all weren't around
The first week you did a 'Aight'
But then that shit went down

Why everybody tryna bring me down?
Because of me, they respect H-town
Look, I was here when y'all weren't around

Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

Don't you know, that I love you so
Don't you know, that I love you so, baby

Don't you know, I love you so

Deep inside I go, baby scream fo' mo'

Let you run the show, a queen you will be
Satin sheets, pat lace, Victoria's Secret
And I know your body need it gotta make your mind believe it
All above, all the love, on my purpose is defeated

I guess that Lil' Keke has the key to the do'
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so

You a driver for a car, I'll make you a star
As I floss Jaguar, to wherever you are
Long distance in the distance on my cellular
And no way's too far for my private jet
I'm on a flight, hold tight, keep it nice and wet
Please don't get upset, the fun just begun
want to want a job done, will you make me a son?
Will you make me a daughter?  Do I need to pump harder?
Turn the temperature up on the bed so we can heat 'em warmer
A heart of a villain, a thug-like nigga gets harder gets liver
More deeper to the river
You shiver you shake, ice cream and candy
I wonder how it feel when your water breaks
No mistakes allowed at the rodeo show
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so, uh

As I gaze in your eyes, it's not a surprise
That I'm the perfect size bumpin' between your thighs
Just time to realize, don't need a disguise
I'm a star on the rise, only out for the price
Dig deep into your soul, then get caught in the rapture
Yo' mind I'ma capture, night before morning after
First chapter Illuminati, beamas & benzes
7-day vacations, all-paid expenses
I'm a playa fo' life, thanks to this rap
I can floss, I can flap, with my salary cap
H-Town's on the map, and nothing is negative
I'm the owner of the firm, I make you an executive
Cause just then you will see that you do want to be
With Lil' Keke in the land of free
Do you want to, are you gonna?  Let's sit in the sauna
And laugh our life away while we blow marijuana
It's goin' DOWN

on that one right there

Blaze up the indo, light the chocolate tye
Sittin' on South Race screens, ballin' out the sky
Hoes diss that ass cause they want to buy me Ralph Lauren
Cause big 'o 19's look lovely on the foreign
I ain't borrowing, the baddest, the V-12 is the baddest
A rhymin' afterattics gave me superstar status
Longers get my list, haters got me pissed
I used to sell rocks, now they all on my wrist
Feel this before yourself, step and get in this
The playa, the pimp, young thug and a menace
Pretendness is endless, and crank up confusion
Yo sweet cal is used in knockin' out Houston

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town
It's goin' down, and they can't really see
Screwed-Up Click for life, this is Lil' to Keke

Two, is ballin' in the mix
And hit me on the beep if you need thirtysix
Quickly, we're the grands of high rexis
I'll make you mighty reckless to run up on the Lexus
It's still this game from a Southern gangbanger
No anger to a stranger, but it's one up in the chamber
Of the blared straight glock cause haters come in flocks
It don't face born and raised on the 8100 block of Herschelwood
And the point is understood
We keep it all good in this crack-controlled hood
It ain't too late to set it straight, real players don't hate
Push weight and keep fate and the money that I make I'ma break
500 mean gold, tapes sold, story told, from the North to South Pole
21 years old, want to bone, won't drown
Just another pimp comin' out that H-Town

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town
It's goin' down, and they can't really see
Southside representin' and this is Lil' to Keke

First three, who it be, L-i-l K-e
That's me, I'm a g, from the southside of the T
You and me, baby, let's get a room for the hour
Get high as a tower, bust a nut and hit the showers
You gone with the wind, after while it's on again
This time bring a friend, a couple corners we gone bend
Let's pretend that this sin, ain't even been committed
Once I split it then I hit it, you in love, go'on admit it
It's goin' down, yeah I'm talking to you
H-Town, smoked out jammin' Screw
Tell your crew it's '97, it ain't no refusin'
We got 'em to the bottom now they all lovin' Houston

It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
All these playas comin' up out that H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know we bout to climb
All these ballers representin' that damn H-Town
It's goin' down, and you know it's goin' down
Throw your hands in the air for that H-Town
It's goin' down, and they can't really see

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Lil' Keke,"We had fights and arguments and all the above
I guess that's the life that comes with true love
Sixteen, probably being too fly
But it's a trip girl look how ten years went by
On the passenger side when I drove my first car
With no, a.c. just praying to be a star
We skipped school, and move around on the double
Go to the crib do it like a married couple
You a hot girl, and I wanna be your T
We both learned the hard way, that's how shit be
And a lot of drama, and I ain't gone lie, it's cheap
But at the end of the day girl you still my boo
It wasn't ever bout the money or the late night grind
Cause a nigga went broke, and did it three more times
From the lame game, to the fortune and fame
Your heat still the same, ain't a damn thang changed, c'mon

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

When I left girl, I was coming back to get you
It was picture perfect, but I could paint a perfect picture
I've been hard broke, but it's all in your mind
I use to think about my daddy saying look in time
Cause the media, the public you know how they do it
We use to block em out the way because we so use to it
I don't know everything, but I'm a swear I do
Cause I be damned if another nigga run through you

I use to lace you up, I got you right and tight
Niggas fly as a jet, so don't take that flight
I ain't the one, Lil' Keke the Don, I bar none
Everything done changed since the birth of my son
I'm a different man, whether you see it or not
It's gone be hard for another dude to take my spot
I get my cash baby, because you know it's a must
But the money ain't a thang, that ain't nothing on us, c'mon

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

Ain't nothing in the world could take the place of you
You your daddy's best man, and you just turned two
I love the way you high five and jab like defeat
Get dressed and grab your hat cause you rolling with me
You turn the music up soon as we get in the truck
And when I turn it down to talk to you turn it right back up
When we jump out, you want the first thing you see
And I can't really say nothing shit you just like me
You my heart, you my soul, you my pride and joy
You my nigga, you my ace, you my baby boy
You throw your dukes up homie like you ready to fight
With something new everyday, boy you flying your kite
And you stay motivated, so I keep on strutting
And I swear on my life, I wouldn't trade you for nothing
You the best thang happened, couldn't see it no better
Having anything you want, you my dog forever, c'mon

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

(Verse Two: Lil' Keke)
Lets get ya mind right cause I'm on another page

and you said ya really love him ain't nothin wrong wit dat
so what's the deal? with the sad thing, the mad thing?
everytime you see a nigga you talkin bout a change
you needa chill, relax, and be cool up on da real
keep ya head focused so you know what it is
but you been down for a minute tho you ain't da average ho
ain't no need to lie its gon' be hard to let you go
lets take it slow and not to fast girl this is thug world
chocolate, and vanilla that's a hell of a swirl
holdin hands up on the beach you use to love that shit
shoppin sprees in New york you know we stayed in a mink
you doin 9-to 5, you know I do it live
and when you layin down and sick that's when I come beside
this ain't no perfect match and it might not happen
just to give it to you straight I'm in love wit rappin
that's alright though I'm tryna get mo
I made my way up to the front, and out the back do'

You know I'm dubbed out, on every ride that I drive
Let me take a moment, to introduce myself
Cause baby girl I see you want it, and I could tell you on it
It's the millennium, I'm trying to light up the stage
And I be taking it to the max, because I want to stay paid
You know the album is hot, I'm in the spots you not
And if I pull a gun to shoot, then best believe you shot
Cause I'm a soldier a vet, with no time to sweat
From the store to the deck, and checking on internet
I be going off, girl you ain't heard about Lil' Keke
From the Dirty South, he got a bad mouth
It ain't no thang mayn, a bunch of haters in the world
Say it's a damn shame, but I just maintain no game
Get your cash and mash, on your plan
Cause the G in my life, stands for gangsta my man

[Hook - 2x]
I'm a G, it ain't no telling what you cats might see

And I be getting my money first, cause that's me

Bringing down the rap draft, cause I'm a first round pick
And from the booth to the stage, man I love that shit

You know the Southside, quick to represent for they folk
You know the Eastside, they putting it down for the cheddar
And the Westside, you know they down for whatever
This another chapter, of the life after
Selling dope on the block, but now a paid rapper
I'm not a high capper, but I do get plex
Am I living like a baller, then the answer is yes
Listen up nigga, I ain't tripping when I tell you I'm about my scrilla
And I ain't tripping, when I tell you I'm a mad killa, but I'm a O.G
And when I'm gunning niggaz running, cause they know me
You better show me, cause all that chatter don't just matter
Nigga homie, cause you gon owe me
Cause this the damn song, you playing games with my family
You get stepped on, so nigga get gone

Puffing on Afghan, and not hydro
What the deal, I'm working my wheel and showing skills
Sipping hen on the rocks, floss in the drought
I'm ripping up my chest, cause I'm choking on the best
Smoking endo nothing less, oh yes I confess
Guess what's next, I'm squashing the plex, I'm in the Lex
Bought your girl a new dress, just to give me some sex
Cause I'm ripping up the mic, and I dress so fly
Some people they wonder why, that I stay so high
Cause I'm a O.G., I know you know me
You got some drank up in the glass, go on po' me
We getting gone baby, cause we got it that way
And we gone fire something up, with no time to play
And its me you see, on the call at three
Grab your sack out the car, come and smoke with me

Money coast to coast fa sho, its understood
Can't nobody stop this thang, that we do
And the world slowed up baby, thanks to Screw
We some trend setters, focus on the chedda
Paying dues in the game, its gots to get better
Watch the smoke just erupt, let the roof back
When we roll in the trunk
Roll em up fat, and squash the chit chat
Three piece suit, with matching dob hat
I'ma get throwed, and let the game be
Twist one playa, the smoke is on me

[Chorus: Shima]
[Lil' Keke]
I feel like ecstasy, when you take control of me
Cause we rolling strolling hard, and you know its holding me
Getting high, just like the stars in the sky
Floating on cloud nine, when I pass you by
Cause we ride and slide, until the sun come up
And if you got something to do, then you shit out of luck
Cause this the episode, we just waiting to explode
And breaking the microphone, cause my game is cold
Go hard in the paint, when I bump the dank
Its gonna be a little bit better, when I mix the drank
Let's get it cracking, pimping and macking with no jacking
Keep the smoke going, and keep the cash stacking
For real, we smoke the best and feel right
Purple crushed, blue berry and a dash of flight
Its going down, and it ain't for free
Everybody in the place, come and smoke with me

From 10's to 24's, we goin' crawl tonight
Shot call tonight, you rolling with the Boss Hoggs
Everything free or V.I.P., with the Outlaws

And tell the valet dude, to buck you right by my slab
And get what you can grab, from Grey Goose to Bacardi

Bunch of dime pieces in thongs, all on the dance flo'

What happened at the Hogg palace, stays at the palace
I got spots in every hot spot, from L.A. to Dallas
You can't miss me, it's my party you can't diss me

Everywhere we go, for real it's going down

With Heinekens for the chaser 
Police'll never chase us 
We too fly for that 
Process the fingerprinted 
We too fucked for that 
I be, flirtin for certain 
Wearing short skirts and 
But ain't no shit certain 
See, that's the difference between me and other bitches 
They fuck to get they riches 
I fuck to bust a nut 
Lil Kim not a slut 
I gotta reputation to look out for 
Plus my boss is a outlaw 

Uh, these mothafuckas think they tough guys 
Mothafuckas better hold hands stepping on ass
Foggot ass mothafuckas 
Really ain' t no true players 

Death comes the shit that oppose the clique 
Dick-riders get off the dick 
'cause Larceny got guns for why'all 
And if I get bagged my lawyers got tons of ones for y'all 
Catching cases, niggas pull they macs out 
Niggas getting mad 'cause I dug they backs out 
Then I blacks out 
Start shooting kids, cribs suspicious 
Making my escape jumping bridges 
Malicious, sometimes the danger taste delicious 
Rule number three don't take love from no bitches 
You know what makes me much stronger than you 
I can take pain much longer than you 
So what you gonna do when I run up in that ass, creep

Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude
Or we tastin' like food when we get in the mood
Listen girlfriend we don't mean to be rude
But anything I touch come straight to the rear

In the M.A.F.I.A.'s Land ya'll
Where loyalty is everything 
The M.A.F.I.A. forgives but never forgets
Let me tell you

In the MAFIA's land where there's one boss and one clan
Yes mans they surround us like steaks in pans
All 'em wanna be the man right hands wash the left hands
Loyalty's priority in this fam
Where life's initiated ain't no givin' it back
Once you in it like Bennet you'll soon be lieutenant
Like me the Don Juan Miss Yvonne
the sweat-a the money gett-a 
Copin mad cheddar
Stevie's all Wondering how I got in this position
One day Frank was fishin' for competition expidition
Number one, his name is Barry Madanno
Push the phat Milano '96 mission cost ya barizano
I lay gently in the Bently through binoculars he seemed popular
Givincci socks Cartier coolats
H-class rocks and charms like Bohemians
Sick like lukemians, receding hairlines
Watch how genuine his gold mine decline
When Frank pops the wine, I cocks the nine
Niggas peeped it from behind and slipped their clips in quick
One chick named Nick thought she was the shit 
Tried to play Big Poppa, don't worry 
Minutes before I dropped her the blow! blow! blow!
Like a parol-e the bitch violated
So how you like it coffins or creameted

There ain't a day in my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back and won't cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
But now it's just me and my niggas, whah
There ain't a day in my life that rolls by

But now it's just me and my niggas, whah

Street murders, thug parasites
We official no fake gators
Coppin' fire arms with dug missles
We leavin scar tissue
That nigga Barry still aggy about that slut
Mob nigga what! threw the gang sign up
The nigga chuckles, just slip the loot
On my belt buckles and cracked his middle nuckles
Damn how could a deal for a couple mill
Result to such violence 
And throw our whole shit off balance
Yet still, they pat me down from all angles
Trapped inside this devil's triangle 
Like Bo I had the Jangles
And movin' slow to slide up on these Mexicans
One cross eyed and hunchbacked
The other must be mixed with black
The third nigga had missin' teeth and tatto tear drops
Long hair, chest  for like a bag of rocks
Before this chops 
I grabbed the keys to locks, the jewels and the rocks
The cream in the box, etc. etc. etc. and it don't stop
I got away with everything, the cash and the stash

There ain't a day in my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back and won't cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
But now it's just me and my niggas, whah
There ain't a day in my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back and won't cry

But now it's just me and my niggas, whah

So now I'm titled mission acomplished
My man was astonished
He looked as if there was a foul aroma in the air
Stinkin! I know what this nigga thinkin'
Damn she's too little, too pretty, too quiet
The bitch is hired, mob's wife for life
Diamond heist with Trife, contracts on your life
We increase the price, uuhh
So guess who the bitch is, but for now I be the mistress

There ain't a day in my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back and won't cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
But now it's just me and my niggas, whah
There ain't a day in my life that rolls by

Lil' Kim,"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny Rimmy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind
It felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
Used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep,I took the keys to the jeep
Tell him ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanel's, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' tha mike
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
the motherfucker never ate my pussy

[Chorus:
I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue you
Had a weedspot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't cap
I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he want to get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four stroke creep
I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin.""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double plat
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones
I give you ten G's nigga if you leave me alone, screamin'

[Chorus:]

The moral of the story is this
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

[Chorus:]",Not Tonight
Lil' Kim,"Yeah, uh, fuck that yo I want some pussy tonight 
I think I want to fuck my bitch Goldie and shit 
Only because she got some money for me and shit 
I think about fucking her 

And go fuck my other bitch that live in fucking big houses 
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do but check it 
How you spell cash? See's and some hash 
At last a nigga kicking game full blast 

How you want it, diamonds or dime-elles 
Jansport book bags and bags from Chanel 
And Seebeeaki, smelling up my Kawasaki 
Jawns by Versace all them joints by Jockey 

Clock me workin real hard for a nickel 
He drive a tricycle and his pants too little 
And his shoes too little 
Won't you get with the clique with the big ass dicks 

That make sure your kicks fit 
The real shit, true, balla pack steel shit 
The nigga with, the movie and the mill shit 
Mass appeal get me in the clubs for free 

So all you got to do for me is just 
Make your way to my king sized bed 
And lie on my pillows and my Gucci bed spread 
Keep the pussy out the other man's bed 
Just gimme some head, gimme some head 

[Chorus]
If you ain't suckin' no dick we don't need it, we don't need it 
If you ain't lickin' no clits, we don't want it, we don't want it 
If you ain't drinkin' no nut, we don't need it, we don't need it 
If you ain't lickin' no butts, we don't want it, we don't want it 

Some bitches do and some bitches don't 
Ride a dick until he brush it I know I won't 
Niggas cum too fast for me 
A waste of a good dick if you ask me 

I like a nigga like to put his back in it 
If it's a weave fuck around and pull a track in it 
All I get, few strokes that's it 
This bomb ass shit's got your cigarettes lit 

Who me, forced to use plan be masturbate, play with the pussy 
This nigga here bust off snorin' 
He straight, I knew this date would be borin'
I want to wake him up to do his duty 

Nigga use that tongue, click the booty, click the booty 
You want to steal the pussy like a thief 
Now I'm kissing lips without the teeth 
So I could bust a nut or two come clean like Jeru 
Goodnight to you too boo 

[Chorus]

Nine out of ten women, want to spit, on the skin of Blake Carrington 
But I need much more to get raw, dick to jaw, dick to jaw 
You drinkin' babies, don't want to hear baby strictly (yes boo) 
Well if he cum up on your chest slow 

If not then your not down with me

Uh, uh, check it

Yo I be buyin em V's, so all my girls be eyein Cease
Comin backstage, dyin to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin wit bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

While you tryin to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude
Or we tastin like food when we get in the mood
Listen girlfriend we don't mean to be rude
But anything I touch come straight to the rear
I take chickenheads like the Playmate Of The Year
Cause when I first met her, she had the Lex and the 'tegra
Game real good, sex was even better
I got it for the cheddar once I hit it in the sack
Cause I'm Cease a.k.a. Long Dick from the back

Especially when I know yo' man is fee-ble 
It's Cease Degenaro, you know how we do
My game is tight, we do the same every night

You messin with city kings with glissy rings
That's gonna show you good time pretty thing
Cause you was spotted, in the club lookin exotic
by somebody, short, dark and chocolate

.. My Aunt Dot
left a glock and some blood on my sheets
Told me clean the shit up, then she hit the streets
Even though I'm her niece, she copped me a piece
Wack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the silencer
What? She don't know I like my guns pretty?
Like my boy Castor Troy with the twin-glizzies
I heard a knock at the door {*knock knock knock knock knock*}
To my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes
Who are you?

[Lil' Shanice]
Whattup? I'm Shanice, don't remember me?

[Lil' Kim]
She called me by my government name, Kimberly
Who sent you?

[Lil' Shanice]
My mom sent me; her name is Dottie
She packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie

[Lil' Kim]
Hmmph, she was cute; and mad fly
She had the Prada knapsack, with the hat to match
Bavari hiking boots, with the mink bubblegoose
and I could see she was admiring my Minski suit
Then she handed me the note

[Lil' Shanice]
Here - read this

[Lil' Kim]
I just stared her up and down
cause I couldn't believe this - then I opened it
It said, ""Bitches is out to get you;
your so-called friends, put a bomb in your Benz.
I'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends.
They know where you live, so evacuate the crib.
And oh, the little girl, that's your cousin Shanice.
Since I can't be with her, I need you to babysit her.
Besides; she looks up to you - you're her idol -
and tomorrow is her first violin recital, 
and she would be more than happy if you could take her.
Peace, my number's on the back of the paper, hit me later.""
Damn.. what went wrong? 
Can't we all just get along, and make hit songs? 
Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
If this was a show, why'all hoes would get ""gonged""
Cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on
What the fuck you waitin for? see'mon, let's get it on
What? What's takin you so long? I got plans for the future
to bring back your head like Medusa

Chorus: Lil' Kim (repeat 2X)
Girls be actin stink, and mad funny
why'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts.. (I'm killin why'all)

[Lil' Kim]
Uhhh, we in the Range in this fucked up weather
It's snowin and I'm tryin to put the whole shit together
How Laverne, she always wanted to be like me
and dress like me, and look like me
and Nicole, it's like she lived in my house
Askin me for money, day in - day out
And last but not least the grimiest one Tayesha
She planned it all, come to find out her name is Keisha
see'mon Shanice I'm takin you to my house in L. Conn.
(I want to go with you!) Uhh, be quiet, and we'll get along fine

[Lil' Shanice]
see'mon please, I want to be just like you
600 Mercedes, and 380's in my doll babies
Crazy baguettes in my barettes; and,
H-class rocks inside my baby G shop
Fuck Barney and Lambchops; I don't love them hoes!
But anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
Diamonds on my toes, X-and-O's
Versace hottie in designer clothes
Scoop Lil' Nique and Jus, then take 'em to Toys'are'Us
Make em spend they cheese then kick 'em out and take the bus
I'm the S-the-H-the-A-the-N-the-I-the-see-the-E
but all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee
What what? I like the green, know what I mean?
Ever seen The Professional? (uh-huh) Well I come cleaner

[Lil' Kim]
You know what? I like you; little big person
but rule number one - no cursin
Anyway, what you know about that?
You too young for that, when I was your age
I woulda got hung for that
Then I picked up the phone, to call my Aunt Dot
so she could fill me in a little more about the plot
Hmm.. nine-one-seven, eight-five-eight, two-one-two-two
""Hello?"" Yo, what's the deal?
Why these bitches buggin out; 
I mean, what's this all about?
""See it's sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
They don't want you to win no more
Soul Train they don't want you to attend no more
And I guess that's why, they ain't your friends no more
The other day, when I was comin out the grocery store
I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door""
For real? ""Yup, then I choked the bitch out
At least one to the heart, tied up her hands and feet
Through her in my backseat,
then I dumped her on a dead-end street
The other two? Yeah they still linger
But don't you lift a finger, I'ma get 'em
so just pray I come home
and when we hang up, get rid of your phone""
Whoo! When Aunt Dot comes, oh brother
It's like five Bloody Mary's, one after another
Hmmph, she have you stressed, no wearin white, no sex
And when she get vexed, you guess what happens next
Cause them other two girls, that's still on the menu
is the reason why the story is to be continued..

Chorus",Aunt Dot
Lil' Kim,"I gets right to the point - no time to play around
When it comes to this cheddar - lay a nigga down
Bust shots at his Rover if he dare come back around
Pay me on time or I gots to take mine
At first I seem friendly; but that's just in me
I warn you - when I blow, it gets a little windy
You make me want to fight you, I ain't nothin like you
Y'all ""Paper Thin,"" my shit recycled
They call me Lil' Kim, a.k.a. Cover Girl
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another fuckin world
Niggaz buy me glass slippers and diamond fingernails
And aww, shit, I got it all in this bitch

[Chorus: (x2)]
Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at?  Where the stash at?
Nigga pass that!
We rollin in tinted Nav's
TV's in the dash, see we love the cash

To all my bitches in the strip club - shakin they ass
(I ain't mad, do your thing mami!) Get that cash!
And all my hustlin niggaz still out on the ave.
Fightin over blocks and who got the best rocks
And ""Goodness gracious,"" the struggle never stops
The things we all do to keep our pockets filled with knots
People fuck to my music - they say it's pornographic
My Billboards is nice; one day gon' be a classic
I fuck with dudes, with ""Members Only"" jackets
That sleep on brass beds, with money for a mattress
""Gettin' Money"" bitch, and I roll with dimes
Take pictures with our nines on the cover of New York Times
Tattoos down our spine with the the picture of a dime
Cuttin niggaz short like inmates for phone time
Everything I get is - custom made
Niggaz, want to get laid; I gotta get paid

Yo Check them out Yo yo yo
When it's murder on my mind, I do it all the time
Got tombstone flow, wit a casket rhyme
Your gats is plastic, I got platinum nines
With gold shells Banger Vegas tap yah spine
I'm the type to spazz out and take back what's mine
Rep for my hood niggas slinging crack and dimes
Half is mine
So you know it's half my time
In the pen or the box
With my man on the ox
We gon do it like we did it on the block
Let's roll
Like wit 60's 30's
forty niggas with me
Rep yah hood
Rep yah block
Rep yah city
This is me talkin, without the Remy in me
I kick it from the heart, that's why niggas feel me
Show ya'll the true meaning why Banger act willie
Cause I start to spazz and smack a bitch silly
They call Leo Ganza wit the twin nine millis
Yeah niggas

My thirty-two bullets got all yah names on it
Hit them in the brain, niggas slaying
Layinh dormant
Iced out grenade, with the big chains on it
New Years blimp With B.I.G. name on it
Iceburg sweaters with Kim name on it
Cease-A-Le Tee with big blood stain on it
Every time I sign a check, I sign a thug name on it
Niggas got rhymes but they flow's so boring
No stage shows, so forget about touring
Mad at my team cause my niggas stay scoring
All you gotta do is make a false move and it's warning
My guns bust
Niggas get wet when it's pourin
Rain down long like Kim gettin dressed in the morning
Five star general, spit a uzi at yah coffin
Run up in yah crib without a search warrant

So I'm about to get on some Left Eye shit
And start burnin' down niggaz cribs

When we met, I can't front, I was all in your shit
Even though I was a bitch playin' hard to get
'Cause see I never felt this way in my life
It didn't take long before you made me your wife
Shoppin' sprees and puttin' money in my pockets
Pictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets
And my girls, knew you wasn't no good
They told me bout them broads you was fuckin' in the hood
You said I was a diamond, and you was like a pearl
So daddy how could you do this to your baby girl?
Memories, is all it brings when I look at my rings
And ""Heartbreaker"" is the song I sing (c'mon, c'mon)

Breakfast in Paris, dinner in Milan
Sex on the beach, yeah we had it goin' on
Then one day you hid my birth control pills
Said the way I sucked your dick it had you head over heels
When you got rich I helped you run your company
For eleven years, and now you want to dump me?
And just to think, I was about to have a baby for you
And then some bitch you was fuckin' said she was havin' one too?
You wrong!  Nigga dead wrong, you know the song
""Don't know what you've got til it's gone""
After the fight, the other night, and we both went to jail
I burnt all your clothes up, I was ""Waiting to Exhale""

[Chorus]

Now I'm back to my old ways, like in the old days
Flirtin', not givin' a fuck, what?
Got you lookin' in the mirror sayin', ""Damn!""
Sick thinkin' 'bout the next man fuckin this tight pussy
Niggaz want me, even though they got a honey
If I'ma be number two, they givin' me some hush money
Ask Whitney, I learned how to break a heart from you
'Cause when a woman's fed up, it ain't nuttin' you can do
I'm that Bitch, don't you ever forget
Witchu when you rich or when you ain't have shit

The wounds heal slow, you just don't know
At times, I don't know what to say
And all I do is pray, day to day
But still, I feel my strength might die
Like right now, I'm tryin' hard not to cry
Even when I close my eyes, I still see it
Damn, I just don't believe it
The bad times I buried, like the cemetery
Unworthy people playin' beneficiaries
A lotta people eatin' off of one man's death
Don't you worry B.I., I'ma ride to my last breath
You killas, caused a lotta devastation
You have no idea what you did to this nation
I fuckin' hate you, excuse my frustration
But just when I'm about to quit, God tells me to just

Frank White, the man with the money and the fame
Passed away, now bitches wanna claim his name
I been with my nigga before he came in the game
No one's, no V's, we used to take the train
Just us and the Mafia goin' out to parties
I guess back then we was real nobodies
But he was my nigga, and I was his bitch
I rolled hard with him, how could I forget him
Had beef with yo wife that ain't patched up
But still got love for your kids
Even wrote 'em in my will
And I'ma make sure the fam keep a decent meal
No matter what I got to do, or who I got to kill
Shit is real, baby, there ain't no appeal
If I'm fucked up, imagine how Mrs. Wallace feels
Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
So to my ladies, don't think I haven't walked in yo shoes
Or thought this was only happenin' to you, righ'
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on this boo
Cuz trust me, I know exactly what you're going through

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better

So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
Depressed, stressed, don't know who's my real friends
One thing's for sure, I can count on my mens
D-Roc, Money, L, Lil' Cease, and PD
My whole B.I. family, remind me of you
We miss you so much, I love you so much
Never thought life without you would be so rough
But I know we gon make it
We ain't happy, but we fakin'
And to New York, thanks for the support
And all our real fans, I'm shoutin' out the whole land
This is somethin' young kids just won't understand
How they took away this beautiful man
Who shared so many memories
I could go on and on, but a song can only be so long
It's been hard, but I told God that I put up a fight
So here's a Long Kiss Goodnight, Frank White

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better

I've been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell I even f*** with different races
A white dude - his name was John
He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm, uh
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan my nigga from Down South
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony he was Italian (Uh-huh)
And he didn't give a f*** (Uh-huh)
That's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the morning
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi, used to be a Deacon
But now he be sucking me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big as* dick and a hurricane tongue

(Sisqo:)
So, how many licks does it take till you get to the centre of the?
('Cause I've got to know)
How many licks does it take till you get to the centre of the?

This verse goes out to my niggaz in jail
Beatin' they d*cks to the double-X-L; Magazine (uhh)
You like how I look in the aqua green? Get your Vaseline
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby...ohh...yes ohh!
Jailer...open up...cell, block, eight
All right nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen; get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster
Niggaz do anything for a Lil' Kim poster
Eses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs
Up North in the hole, they all want to know

(Sisqo:)
How many licks does it take till you get to the centre of the?
(Tell me, ha)
How many licks does it take till you get to the centre of the?

(Lil' Kim:)
If you drivin' in the street, hold on to your seat
Niggaz, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
(Shoom!) That's me the Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street - gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hundred on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 A.M. I'm on the way to club
After three bottles I'll be ready to f***
Some niggaz even put me on their grocery lists
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolates
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavours
High-class taste niggaz got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

Take it from me

Are taking over for the new millennium
Ow!

What the hell do you want from me?
I'm just trying to be all that I can be

How dare you accuse me and my family of fucking clones!
Leave us alone!
Me and Puff is like Janet and Mike
You make us want to scream, know what I mean
Yeah, yeah
I know y'all rather see us dead
No more platinum plaques certified lead
We got to many chips for y'all
Queen Bee, Queen Bee make hits for y'all
Take a breath, inhale, exhale till there's no more left
In the name of the father, son, and daughter
Here comes the new world order
You can't stop it
Mother Earth this my universe

Will the court please rise?
Judge Funk Doctor Spock residing

[Prosecutor]
Your honor Lil' Kim is a threat to society
She has shown a blatant disregard for the law
And has killed six fine law enforcement agents in the line of duty
For the vicious acts
She should be punished to the fullest extent of the law

[Lil' Kim]
Pardon me your honor
May I address the bench?
They try-na assassinate me like they did to Larry Flynt
* Coughs
Excuse my persona
I may be hardcore but I'm not Jeffrey Dalmer
Ever since I killed ?em
I ain't been in trouble since
It wasn't my fault I acted out of self-defense
He killed my best friend
(Who's him?)
I mean them
They was all dressed in blue and they want me dead too
They had real grenade bombs inside of their palms
And a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms
See them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm
I was getting my ass licked by this cat named Tom
(Stop!)
I heard three guns cocked that's when Tom dropped
They sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top
(Oh she's lying!)
Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor
Fingerprints all on the door
Need I say more?
Pulled out the remote can and shot blows after blow
Ploom! Queen off her toes
They fell down like dominoes
I think it was the Matrix, I mean it was the Matrix
What was I do?
Sit back and just take this?
Yo I tell you now
If I lose this debate
Like in Dead Presidents
I'm going out like Lorenz Tate
See I ain't gon be stupid
I'm gon take all why'all to the shift
I should be able to say what I want
What the fuck I plead the fifth
(Now Kim, Kim)
Fuck that Cee-lo
I got to save the world
The first female king and they mad cause I'm a girl

[Cee-lo]
Uh with all due respect your honor
Excuse my client's temperament
Who has had social intelligence?
With so much innocence we have to implement
She was slightly out of place
But if you grant us a grain of your grace
I'll assure you it's only stress due to the severity of the case
Imagine for a minute, yourself in the same shoes
The same sense of survival and the same nothing to lose
Your children, your lovely wife
I mean look at her
The only thing she's guilty of is having no choice in the matter

[Kim]
Lord I cry, I cry
From the things that I've seen
That I've seen
And Lord I cry, I cry
From the things I've seen, ooh
If you only knew the things I've been through
Oh yeah
You'd know why
You'd know why I cry, I cry, I cry

[Redman]
Order! Order! Order!
Order! Order! Order!
Order in the courts, I'm examining her thoughts
And the notes on why you started slaughtering the fort
The men dressed in blue they were undercover cops
Hungry to see another black motherfucker shot
They ran up in your spot and no one gave the orders
Even Tom was tapped with a mic and a tape recorder
(He was in on it too!)
Yeah
(I should've known)
Yeah
(Objection your honor)
Yo objection overruled
I know the news they tried to pay the grand jury
To give you life sentence with parole up in thirty
Now that's dirty, surveillance and you debate
Fuck Will! Now you're the new Enemy of the State
Angela Bobbett's cake compared to you
And Junior Mafia that clique ain't scared to move
So they took precautions
Grenades from all force and
Professional marksman with four fours of war hymn
But you stopped, dropped, rolled and duck
Shot back other bitches would've folded up
Now that's my kind of bitch
I know I'm the judge
But I love that bitch
And I'm coming with her
Creme of crop and me I'mma hold her down
Resign with A-K's so we blowing the trial

This chick running around with this stink ass gap
And them fake ass raps having panic attacks
You ain't a star and your record company know that
How you make all this money you just fart and blow it?

I'm a business woman now so I'm not concerned
I'd bet on Lil' Cease before you and your firm
If this was back in the days I would've been snatched you
I'm getting money now, them bitches in the hood they can have you

All I could think about is how he killed my man Smiles
Cut his head off, masacre style
Yeah, Syrus did it
Syrus the virus they call him
When I finish with 'em, please, his name is Swiss cheese
My main focus is his right-hand man Mousey
Sheisty and two-sided, confession, dick ridin'
And his boys, they seem to be all on his dick
I mean the whole situation is really makin' me sick
And when Sysrus got up and dipped off to the bathroom
We started suckin' niggas up like the vacuum
Bullets flyin' non-stoppin', bodies droppin'
Puff yell (Bloody!), that's the cops then
My trigger finger startin' itchin'
That's when Syrus came spittin' from the kitchen
The next second, he missed me
Listen, it's soundin' like the 4th of July
Like a solar eclipse is lit right in the sky
I can't believe this guy, he won't fall over
Holes in his body the size of cup-holders
One more shot, he's over, shit Puff I'm empty

But I'ma hold my breath 'til he falls to his death
But he was helpess, his little kid beat off in his pelvis

        Is this Lil' Kim?
[Kim]   Who's this?
[Girl]  Don't worry 'bout all that
        I found your number in my man's pocket
[Kim]   Well shit bitch!
        Give it to him then!
        No wonder the mothafucka hasn't call me yet!
        Look at your fuckin' groupie ass
        Stealin' numbers and shit
[Girl]  Wha? Fuckin' bitch!
        I'mma see your ass at the mothafuckin' concert

Does she do it like me?
Does she work that body?
Throw that ass like pu-pump-pump-pu-pump that hottie
Do she handle it like she got a deep throat?
I mean suck that cock 'til she start to choke
Does she like to have sex high off the X?
Try it with me and tell me who's the best
Does she like to wear thongs that you can eat?
Do she fuck your brains out 'til you fall asleep?

(Chorus)
Bet you she don't fuck you
Like you know I fuck you
And I bet you she will never do, oh
All the things I'll do for you

Is she drop-dead fine?
Does she like it from behind?
Is she fly?
Do she got a style like mine?
Does she slurp it, rub it, jerk it, ride it?
Tell you how you feel when you inside it
You love me, and I know she know
'cause everytime I come around, she be like ""let's go""
Girls know not to leave they man around me
When I get my hands on him 
he puttin weddin bands on me
(Chorus)

I'm the queen of Rap, there is none higher
Did she tell you that?
The bitch is a liar
People spend doe to see me spit fire
And niggas give they life to be with me for one night
I let you come in me, while you stick it in the booty
Lick the nut off, then stick it back in the coot, see
I bet you she don't even know how to kiss
And I bet you ain't never been fucked like this

(Chorus) x2

And I bet ya, and I bet ya baby
And I bet ya she don't fuck you
And I bet ya, bet ya, bet ya baby
And I bet ya she don't fuck you
No, baby

Your career is on the rocks again
Yeah, I'm back on top, what?
You forgot Queen Bitch, W-W-W-dot-com

The Lord is the light of my salvation
Thou shall fear when He calls
So when you MC's come to eat up my flesh and blood
Ya'll all will stumble and fall (ha ha!)
Still that's not all, bitches have the gaul
To be writin' my rhymes, said B.I.G. write my rhymes

Keep my jewels frozen like they've been in the freezer
Haters - if that don't please ya, I don't need ya
Even Mom Dukes live in an igloo
Bought my whole crew businesses for Christmas
Yeah, I see ya'll!
Colorful minks and things
Polars on ya shoulders, about a half in ya rings
Once, got to switch my pitch up
Pin-stripped suits with gauders with vests
Black pearls around the neck
Come on, ya'll chicks can't be serious
How's the weather down there my dear, I'm just curious
Been the sex symbol since Jack B. Nimble
You can never be me, you can only resemble
Copped the presidential suites for weeks, ya'll just a day out
One ass picture in a magazine, I gets a layout
My nigga gone now, so who writin' my rhymes?
No disrespect, ya'll bitches on them publishing checks

[Mario]
Stop wastin' all of your time
Doin' all that rappin', cuttin' or writin'
Don't know that she's the Queen
Why can't you see?
Ya'll should just believe
Everyone's trying to tell you

[Lil' Kim]
If I talk freaky - then that's my business
If I dress freaky - then that's my business
Got folks praticin' how to spit like this
Sexy see-E-O makin' hits like this
HUH?! I know you pissed, but take some advice from me
In five years, you'll be as nice as me
But right now, nah, ya'll ain't ready
I'm a single black female and this goes out to Heddy

Lil' Kim,"Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

To all my motherfuckin' gettin' money hoes
Used to sellin clothes
And all my ghetto bitches in the projects
Coming through like bulldozers
No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch
One that get up in a nigga's ass quicker than an enema
Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never coming home
Kim got him in a zone beating they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbing their tits
What? I'm loving this shit
Queen Bitch!
What bitch you know can thug it like this?
Imagine if I was dude and hittin' cats from the back
With no strings attached
Yeah nigga, picture that!
I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us
No Doubt! Ay yo, yo
Come here so I can bust in ya mouth

No, no, no, no
All I wanna do is get my pussy sucked (Nigga!)
Count a million bucks in the back of an armor truck
While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y.
The BX, the chron-chron
And the list goes on and on
(On and on and on)
Like Erykah Badu
Once he drink the Remi down
Ooh I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him
I said what came to mind like niggas be doing
Yeah baby, I love you long time
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya
I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face

I'mma keep it real
For the dough I might kill
I'm try-na see my face on a hundred dollar bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said 'Whoa! Who's the other guy?'
Hope you know you paying extra for this fuckin' third eye
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth
'Fool, Give me my money!'
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars
Niggas ain't shit but they still can trick
All they can do for me is suck my clit
I'm jumpin' up and up after I cum
Thinkin' they gon' get some pussy but they gets none

(Ay yo, come on here bitch)

I'd like to introduce to you, my bitch

Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap
I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats
Trying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down
I cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah
You broke hoes need to throw in the towel
Life's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel
Who me? That's none of your concern
Like ashes in the urn, more money to burn
Damn my ass is firm, stay away from germs
Pussy flawless, get wetter than worms
If you only knew like Aaliyah
How your man be hawking me and stalking me
When he fucking you he see me
Every crack valve or record he sell I get a piecey
Easy, believe me, my words is credible
Ask Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable
Don't let the QB get a hold of your guy
Sex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die

Your so called vendetta was light like birds' feathers
Even with an umbrella, you can't stop my hurricane
I moved on to bigger and better things
Y'all still making minimum wage
First on stage, like the ever I glade
Leave you amazed
And keep the fifth by the rib cage
All you jealous ass holes is rebellious ass holes
Still trying to recoup from the first album ass holes
You's a gangster, prove it
Wanna shoot me, do it
That's word than Jerry McGuire
I'll set that ass on fire
That's how you work with barbed wire
Carve my name in your face
Pour gas-o-line on you and drop you at the gas station
Y'all chicks ain't blind, I shine like polyeurotheme
Cocoa butter crème
That's the gleam of drugs baby like codeine
Low self esteem, eh-eh, the flows excellent
Your's is satisfactory return them to the factory
I mean practically, the shit is whack to me
Mama bear, finally out of hibernating
Here to tell you chicks to stop tailgating

Often tipsy, cabin in Poughkeepsie
I've been in this shit since Biz hit the, one-two
Nothing left to do
Move it in there, cathedral ceilings
Don't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings
P Diddy introduced me to the business side
Fired me a few mill and a couple of oil spills
That's how we do it, you chicks is no thrill
Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels
Still on tricycles, riding bicycles
Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts
On the countdown, don't make me laugh
Got my own company, I'm chief of the staff
They say we twins then I'm the better half
I'm nasty worse than Howard Stern
This court is adjourned
And now it's your turn bitch

Better off givin' it up, I'm rippin' it up
Spendin' money, livin' it up, not giving a fuck

Hotter than toast, Runnin' the coast
Makin' niggas catch the Holy Ghost
I'm realer than most, wha

What part of the game was this?

Said the world gon' end in 2000 (that's crazy)
I'm the only thing to fear

Get the fans, we the ones to talk
We die real on the streets
So watch where you walk

And you can find me, usually
Talkin' dirty to a cat thugged out
Or even kinda nerdy
Lil' Kim, Lil' Cease and JM

Taking over like a plague on a town
All why'all can do is pray and watch it go down
Like when the ball drop
My fam's all I got, we keep it gangsta

Comin' for why'all, comin' for why'all

Well, if you told me, you were drowning
I would not a lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am

Well I was there and I saw what you did
Saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment

If gettin money is a crime, then I confess
Ain't about money? I could care less
When you see us comin know it's time to collect
Niggaz be like, ""Here come the IRS!""
Kick down doors, shoot through walls
Queen Bee's a movement, fight for the cause

Live guitars, nigga fuck cars

Look out the window, and reach for the stars

Please stop worryin about what I got
What the fuck y'all know about the Yonker Rock
When I'm cookin, keep your hands out my pot
Them boys ain't bad and ain't no bitch greater
Stop tryin to use me as a respirator
I'm the same bitch on the escalator
And I still ain't got no time for you fuckin haters
I might start my day at Piarage'

I'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps
Like the sand in the hour glass you out of your time
Tried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?
Even be at number two, your chances is slim
Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes but I never forget
It's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
I'm gettin money, don't think I just be lettin shit slide
I'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta
Rock this Hollyhood thang y'all need to let me style ya
Come back, to the light ma, I started the shit
How soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit
So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as I'm around, you gon' bow down

The Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin
The Blue Hypnotic Martini Mimosa sippin
Y'all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her can get it whenever
Huh, I got a army y'all can't harm me
If the show was on the other foot you probably try to starve me
Don't get your life tooken I know I got you shooken

I can't take these diamonds with me when I day
I can't build that pretty white house in the sky
I know you wishin that you wrote this song
But these same words comin from you, would be a joke
You better off takin heed from your boy Jada
I know you, hate dyin - but you gon' die a hater
I got a vision, I think for the future baby pah
why'all nearsighted, lotta why'all, can't see that far
Rocks like the street light - baby watch 'em glow
Red yellow and green - don't know whether to stop or go
I'm a chameleon, I got many styles of rhymes
Like a bottle of fine wine I just get better with time
From ""Hardcore"" to ""Notorious"" you studied my flow
And still..

[Chorus] + Governor ad libs
[Lil' Kim]
Whether ya, slingin the rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Or just a fiend for this Queen Bitch of hip-hop
Kimmie bag dudes from the barbershop to the car show
The industry, down to Wall Street
They ask:

[Governor]
What is she like, what does she need?
What is her type, I want to give it to her, tell her please
Be my girl, I'll give her anything
Whatever her heart desires, in this whole world

[Lil' Kim]
Just cause you ain't a millionaire don't mean you can't compete
You ain't gotta be filthy rich, but you can't be cheap
I like a man that can stand on his own two feet
Got a strong business mind, straight out the streets
He gotta have security, power and wealth
Cause I can do bad by my God damn self
And if you spiritual, got a good heart and can make me laugh
And can fuck..

[Chorus Two: Shelene Thomas] + (Governor)
You can get with Queen Bee.. (y'all can get with Queen Bee)
Queen Bee.. (yeah, ye yeah) Queen Bee! (awww)
Take you to ecstasy (she gon' take why'all to ecstasy)
Ecstasy.. (do it to 'em Queen Bee) Ecstasy!
(Yeah.. it's yo' time baby, it's yo' time girl!)

[Lil' Kim]
Ain't nuttin gon' change, my name, gon' get bigger
It's in the cards for Lil' Kim to get richer, and richer
So like it or not, I am who I am
When I die hold my body in the Brooklyn Museum
Now take it to the bridge

[Full Force] + (Lil' Kim)
Baye-ya-da, da, da-da-dahhhhh

This is it, crossin' me was ya biggest mistake
And was it enough that I split 20% of what I make?
Was it enough that I cut niggas half of what I bake?
Ain't enough that I almost lost all my bread
Bailin niggas out, keepin' a roof over our head
Enough is enough I wash my hands I'm done wit it
I ain't playin wit you motherfuckers come wit it

No more franks for this ma, now it's lobster and conck
To my kids in the hood, this one's for you
(Grown folks and grandmas can shake they bum bum too)
So come on (Come on) Come on

[Chorus]",Shake Ya Bum Bum
Lil' Kim,"[Scratched]
Fuckin', fuckin'
Fuckin', fuckin'
Fuckin', fuckin'
Fuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy

[Verse"" 1 Lil' Kim]
Ms. White, that bitch with a thousand looks
Come through with a thousand crooks
I just know what it takes to get this money like Blow
Catch a body, get a face lift, disappear like Pablo
Ya'll niggas think I won't jump in the heap
Well let's dance, you lames are finished
I serve all ya'll cowards like a game of tennis
Act like you want some of this and I'll give you the business
You see the yellow and black, you know what it's about
Wrinkled assed niggas gets ironed, to straighten you out
I got thugs in the east, thugs in the south
That'll stick with the AIDS needle and piss in your mouth
I kept 'em on a leash and now it's time to let 'em out
Better pray to Jehovah, the game is over
Don't ever, ever, ever, ever underestimate
Lil' Kim the postergirl at 718
Ride outta town with my nigga, holdin' his weight
After it's cooked, chopped in eights the size of plates
You bitches ain't been through shit, you just minors
What you know about stuffin' half a bricks in your vagina
It's the dick licker, it's the baby sipper
Ain't a bitch alive can make a nigga cum quicker
Baby girl's pussy get wetter than a shower cap
Got my mans back like a Jansport napsack
And Queen Bee gon' bring you nothin' but heat
Homicide is lookin' for me for killin' these beats
You in the wrong department, this the upperclass section
You hoes is startin' to irritate me like a yeast infection
Good heavens, somebody get the Monostat 7
And hit me why don'tcha, hit me why don'tcha
The boss lady, I hold it down for my badies
Rappers better run and hide 'cause here comes the Beehive

[Verse 2: Reeks]
It's your boy, Money Cash, I get love in the streets
Breathin' dro colored Benz's with dutch colored seats
Lay in the crib on Tuesdays, duckin' the sweep
Nigga jump off, then get pumped off your feet
I'm like Rostein, low key and brilliant with numbers
I'm tryna blow sticky in Brazil with the Hummer
If you spittin' and I'm grippin' this tech
Then that's 32 shots, our throwback's like Mitchell and Ness
Man, I'm a project nigga, still piss on the steps
And keep the brim on my fitted a little twist to the left
I play the block, fifth in my sweats, reppin' my set
It's Rossie from the pharmacy, get it correct 

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
[scratched]
The Beehive
Fuckin', fuckin'
Fuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy
Fuckin' with the Tef-Teflon bitch
Beehive
Fuckin' with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy
Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out
The Beehive

[Verse 3: Bunky S.A.]
Yo, it's Bunky S to the A, and my guns ain't warm
Beatin' niggas close to death with my house slippers on
You ain't a thug cocksucka, you a coward to front
Fuck your project, your building got flowers in front
Every chick I roll with, OZ in the cunt
I was OT in Mass, pushin' flower for months
Sprinklin' gun powder, oughta put a haze on my blunt
I spit a hundred and fifty bars when I'm blazin' 'em out
'Cause I can do that with razor blades stuck in my mouth
Forget a hotel, I'm fuckin' shorty right on the couch
Any rap shit I ever barked on, to hot to handle
And my rims bigger than lower Manhattan manholes
Listen up for 2003 tan rover
Stash box hold guns like Afgan soldiers
Wanna murda 16, well we the niggas you call
Queen Bee and Gotti Kids, muthafuck all ya'll

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Vee]
Uh, yo Vee The Kid, that's the name I earned in the streets
'Cause my bars so hot, it be burnin' the beats
Melt my pen, I have slugs meltin' your chin
When I throw you over the bridge, they helpin' you swim
And you better wear a metal hat when you rappin' on stage
Or have my bullets like e-mail, packin' your waves
Or snatch your face off like I'm Nicolas Cage
And it could be five of ya'll, puttin' eight in your grave
'Cause niggas think they hard, but they softer than bread
When them shells hit your throat, you be coughin' up lead
The next step is to off you, dead
I'ma cut your fuckin' head off and have Kim auction your head (Beehive)
See the kid don't rap for love, I rap for cheques
Even if I know you, I demand respect
And if I put you in the body bag, your man is next
The Advakid and Queen Bee gon' leave the game in a mess (Beehive)

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Goldie]
It's young Goldie, the Advakid, put you to rest
I ride around with two 38's tucked in my sweats
A pump in trunk and a nine under the seat
Enough ammo to blow the earth from under your feet (Beehive)
And we got cake for killas like Hyde and Jeckyl
Snippers put red dots on your face like freckles
Don't make me have to reach for the lead
You'll think the bullets was rain drops how they all hit your head
I'm that slim kid that they say is probably hot
She only with me 'cause of what she think I probably got
Am I gon' be with her for long, probably not
Unless you're cute and suck a dick like a lollipop
Niggas talk about guns and they just bust caps
Niggas talk aboit ki's whey they just flip packs
When it come to my money, suggest you gimmie that
'Cause you know bullets fly in pairs like Petey Pab
(Beehive)

[Chorus]

Now putcha hands around your mouth and holler out
The Beehive",Tha Beehive
Lil' Kim,"Yo I just don't understand
Lately, it seems like I don't know
It just seems like it seems like
Everybody wants

My style, my life, my blood
My shoes, my clothes, my gear
My watch, my rings, my chain
My cars, my money, my home
My body, my sweat, my tears
My power, my fame, my strength
My shit, my this, my that
Bitches, please!

[Chorus]
If you don't stop;
Someone's gonna find yo' ass dead (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food (this is a warning)
Someone's puttin' tags on your toes (this is a warning)
Someone better pray for you (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna get yo' keys (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house (this is a warning)
And put the } straight in your, mouth
This is a woman's, threat (this is a woman's)

Have you ever heard the story, about the M.A.F.I.A. tip
See Big Poppa was shot, a long long long long time ago
And when he was killed, he left me with the throne
And now it seems like, everyone wants my blood

[Chorus]

Don't stop, no no
You'll be sorry
Keep doin it, you'll see
You'll be cryin
I know, whatchu doin
'Cause I'm watchin
Hohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh
Ohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh

Lil' Kim,"Swizz Beatz (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
I introduce to you (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
The Queen Bee (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
She hold the crown in this game (Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?)
Ladies and Gentleman

It's the worlds famous, Lil' Kim, Queen Bee
I am who I am, you just can't change me
No matter what you do, you can't take the hood out me
People been around me for years, don't know shit about me
Dedicated, like Muslims makin' selat
People steady try to make me into somethin' I'm not
That's why I had to cut the grass, so I could see the snakes
Copped the house on the hill so I could see the lakes
What you thought? I'm a girl, couldn't make it alone
Time to turn the heat up and get back in the zone
One day my hairs orange, the next day it's green
The trendsetter's back on your TV screen

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

About five feet even, kinda small in the waist
Rap's sex symbol, real pretty in the face
So what I got even bigger titties than the lakes
Still a sophisticated lady with millions in the safe
Switch up flows like I switch up my clothes
More than Wilt Chamberlain switched up his hoes
I'm a profectionist, gotta stay on my toes
Anything goes when you play with the pro's
I got everybody rappin' about jewelry and cars
Lil' Kim give you a platinum sixteen bars
I'm the real thing, ya'll kareokee stars
This is who I am

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)

No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

I'd rather be dead and rich than broke and livin'
Without rap, I probably woulda been sellin' dope in prison
With some Vera Wang khakis and Nolteychucks
Suckin' the warden's dick in the back of the bus
But God made me what I am today
So I say things ya'll afraid to say
Just 'cause you got a head start that don't make you strongest
He who burns last, burns the longest
Fuck what they say about me
Fact is I'm the legacy of B.I.G.
The Queen of New York, let's get this straight
I'm about to be elected mayor of 718

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)

Here come a bitch with the fly puss', and a nigga with the fly

In the Mickey and Mallory mode, rollin through the streets on
24's
On krunk screamin, ""Die bitch!""
Bout to shut yo' shit down, anybody that opposes to payin us a
fee false
If the straps don't bleed y'all
We put stitches in yo' motherf**kin dome like a league brawl
(Come and roll with this)
Take a journey to the realm of the truth when I bust this
It's the Duke and the Duchess
Leavin haters 'buked and on crutches
Niggaz you cannot touch this
It's a new collaboration of Thug Luv
between the Thug Queen and the Thug Lord
More power than a drug lord
Meant to be because we love each other the way we love war
Gotta rider bet hug yours, cause I'm full of ambition
and ammunition and a 50 like I smoked a sticky stack of hash
Ain't no missin on no critical condition
Murderin is the mission and we can bust a itchy atcha ass
Feel the flow when I drop it
Don't when to stop it, I'm goin pockets and layin bodies down
Feel adrenaline from me and Kim and them
We got it sewed from Brooklyn to Chi-Town
See the artillery, we don't fuck around with silly games, plenty
thangs
Nigga plus I got an illy aim, stick 'em up, steal his chain
Then I spill his brain, then I feel his pain
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Queen, we gon' take over the world
Whatchu know about Thug Luv?

You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler
Gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches
Won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler
Gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches
Won'tcha come and ride with us

It's the T-W-I-S to the T-A, K to the motherf**kin I-M
Bout to shut yo' shit down 
Other albums come out ain't NOBODY gon' buy them
Now who gon' deny them? I'm scared of myself, don't nobody want to
try Kim

(now whassup - y'all better come roll with us)
Who's you Mister? It's Lil' Kim and Twista (and we about this)
For those who doubt this, the game is ours (we gon' run you up
out this)
What a wonderful feeling when you're stealin a million
But the billion jackpot's what I aim for
Get your hands in the air, put 'em up, keep 'em high
Don't want no problems - JUST GIMME WHAT I CAME FOR!
Pull up on your block, eight straight Hummers
Bout to have it locked, eight straight summers
Bank account hold eight straight numbers
Ain't no room for you whack newcomers
We the people's choice because we kick that
nasty ""Hardcore"" shit that you want to hear
Can't fuck with us, hands down we win best murder rap of the
year
Pounds to the misters, hugs for the miss
Bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss
All my bitches pop that thing like this
All my niggaz wave that bling on the wrist
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Duke, we gon' take over the world
Whatchu know about Thug Luv?

Kim is yo' flow hot?
Like a gun shot
Twist' is yo' flow cold?
Well I think so
Kim do you got dranks

Twist' do you got smokes
Well I got 'dro, now baby we can roll

Won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler
Gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches
Won'tcha come and ride with us

Do it like a gangsta, creepin like a murderer
Strapped while I roll on chrome
Lookin for the ones we at war with
When we see 'em we gon' aim for your dome

Hear me Ma we can run this Earth together, come up worse than
ever
Havin big dreams while we back up this work together
Let's set up shop on the block now, takin over yo' tip
Even if we gotta slang dubs
Go to war because I love blood, with a Queen by my side
Whatchu know about Thug Luv?

Do it like a hustler, Lil' Kim and Twista
Might as well ride with us
Male groupies, girl groupies
They're all gon' side with us
Whatcha gon' do, it's the Duke and the Duchess
You need to give it up
We gon' take over the world
Whatchu know about Thug Luv?

Think it's 'bout time that I heat y'all up
Y'all easy bake oven chicks, eat y'all up
Like a ex pill I'm a keep y'all up
And y'all ain't stop me from burn, y'all just don't learn

She at it again

She in it to win
(What's the word?)
She back and she's staying'
(What's the word?)
The bitch ain't playin'

And just when y'all thought y'all had the victory
The one point game I fucked around and hit a three
Swish, all fuckin' net
It's the fourth quarter you're pourin' down sweat

Rap's M.V.P. don't you ever forget
Since you came in this game are there any regrets?
And y'all, dukes are lame don't let 'em back in
What? You ain't heard? Keep at it again

Yo, it's cold at the camp but I'm in it till it's over
Notorious soldier thought I told ya
Niggas is pissin' me off right now
But like that dance, I'm a shake 'em off right now

Who's hot and who's not what's rap and what's not
Whatever nigga I take your spot and your spot
Move work from your block to your block
The neighborhood better keep they fuckin' door locked

Beanie told y'all but I got proof
I speak the truth, every time I step in the booth
Uh, pretty things is all that I mean
Better listen to the words that she sings

And now I could see why y'all all on me
You need a hot remix you could call on me
Niggas do dirty work the shit fall on me
But I could hold that weight and still bake that cake

We get it on in Brooklawn no lie
Bed Stuy holla back B.I. till I die
We get it on in Brooklawn no lie
Bed Stuy holla back B.I. till I die

Get money always but I ain't givin' up rap
Come on now, y'all should know me better than that
I mean, this is somethin' I'm a veteran at
Buy me out, you need more cheddar than that

Who's hot and who's not, what's rap and what's not
Whatever nigga I take your spot and your spot
Move work from your block to your block
The neighborhood better keep they fuckin' door locked

I'm the shit I'm the bread winner
Who's the bitch I'm the big spinner
I give 'em a taste they just want more
Word on the street is I'm who they waitin' for

(What's the word?)
She goin' for delf
(What's the word?)
She 'bout to reinvent herself
(What's the word?)
She reppin' the hood
(Yo what's the word?)
Yeah, the bitch look good

I'm the shit I'm the bread winner
Who's the bitch I'm the big spinner

She done fucked up now
(Shut up, bitch)
Why she get her nosed fixed, why she got bigger tits
Man, get off my girl's shit
(Shut up, bitch)

Everybody talkin', all these haters hawkin'
Paparazzi stalkin' takin' pictures while I'm walkin'
Damn, can't a bitch breathe, gimmie room please
I'm in the paper e'ry day if I piss or sneeze

I used to ride in a rental Lebaron
Now you can catch me in the SLR Mercedes McLaren
Gotta put the doors up, haters pick ya jaws up
I'm in the Trump International, thirty floors up

You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'

Used to talk about the way I wore my clothes
Now every chick look like Lil' Kim in they videos
Now don't come around here with that Wendy Williams shit
Get yo facts straight or shut up, bitch

I hate that people starin' 'cause this chick stay appearin'
In somethin' made with German engineerin' [Incomprehensible]
Homes with French doors and heated marble floors
Whores heated 'cause Momma back and hotter than before

Big bank, hold rank like the late Frank
I does what you can't, I'm everythin' that you ain't
I'm La Bella Don, the biggest bitch in the biz
So don't hate me, nigga, it is what it is

You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'

I just keep climbing up the ladder, y'all never stop my swagger
All this petty chitter-chatter only make my packets fatter
Some peoples jobs just to talk about Lil' Kim
Let's face it, I'm a way of life for all of them

Tabloid magazines rate worst and best dressed
They got some nerve when the ones who do the ratings look a mess
Star Jones don't like me, she cheap and I like the best
Damn, it must feel good to Payless

You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'

You know niggaz hate to see another nigga eat
Quick to put another niggaz business in the street
I wish they'd shut the fuck up, damn good grief
You know your mouth's a cage for your tongue
If you just close your teeth

I heard she mad rich, I heard she dead broke
I heard she sniffin' coke

Haha, I know it's killin' you bitches, I know it's killin' you
She's back, oh my God
You had a voodoo doll and everything, worthless bitch
You just knew, 'Don't let her come back Jesus
Please don't let her come back'

But she's back bitches
Haha, okay look, just, on the count of three
Stop focusing on her and think about you for a second
Now ain't that depressing, ain't it depressin'
See, that's why don't nobody talk about you

Ain't nothin' to talk about
Get yourself a hobby, bitch, learn how to make a quilt or sumin'
Ha, is it really that you hate you?
That's what it is ain't it, just punch yourself in the mouth then, bitch

Every word I utter, I feel strictly gutter
That's why I touch more green than Tiger's putter
So you mad motherfuckers mutter what you wanna
I ain't worried 'bout none of ya, and I'll say it in front of ya
I hear the snakes hiss, talkin' reckless
Thought I'd let it go, and I wouldn't stress it
Haters in the street - y'all worse than the press is
And they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace
I guess things just ain't the same for gangsters
How a snitch nigga make a record called ""Wankstas""
Everything these haters do just to degrade ya
Only made me strong; I say thanks for the favor
Now the D.A. wanna give me time in the feds
I'm from Brooklyn: I could do that time on my head
Come down with my weave straight sittin' on bread
At the gate, gettin' picked up in a new Coupe Phantom

See, I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, my nigga need bail
It's been a couple weeks, and he been sittin' in a cell
The only way to reach him through phone calls and mail
Balloons stuffed with lah up in the cho-cha
Now my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high
He used to keep my fly: he had the six, I had the five
So you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy
At age fourteen I was puttin' in work
At age sixteen I was movin' that work
Gettin' paid for drivin' state to state
Smugglin' weight, prayin' I don't bump into Jake
I traveled through a few places with the burners
In the suitcases; thank God for Big
Damn right, I love the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive, and it's all...

Cowards huff and puff but won't blow shit down
I come through like two airplanes in midtown
Nigga, my get back's the get down
Hit the big nigga first and make the rest sit down
They all talk loud; when they see you, they quiet down
Faggots violated; I wish they'd try now
Just watch how they bitch up, story start to switch up
Punks gettin' left off right where I pick up
Picture in Vogue, Spring/Summer issue
Shoot game official like a ref with a whistle
You know when I do it, I'm doin' it monumental
Leave you speechless, kinda like an instrumental
They ask me if I know what true happiness is
Do I ever feel regret for all the things I did?
Hell no, I love the life I live

Lil' Kim,"Due to the fact that there are some people
Like the lady over there that said she was
Who thinks I'm dirty
I really couldn't give a shit
Cause ya'll by my records
Them same ones that be talkin' 'bout I'm dirty
Be buyin' my shit and hidin' it

Why all di dutty nigga them sit around and judge me
All them a chat bout, don't even budge me cause
Mi no owe nobody no explanation
I convert it over to di almighty one
When dis bad gyal come out
We just run them in di morgue and them can't come out
Some a di gyal 'em need to just shut them mouth
Some a di dutty niggas need to just shut them

Lil' Kim stay hot
Pull up with my nigga in the eighty four yacht
Man this hatin' don't stop
Real recognize real you studio gangsters kill me
I know my vets in the game got to feel me
Cause from the gate I down the door
Like Eddy Murphy I gave it to you raw
Two-piece bikini, Fendi mink draggin' on the floor
Kim been the first lady since I dropped Hard Core
A lot of these hoes livin' vicariously through me
Steada doin' them, they'd rather do me
Watchin' them is like a Broadway play
Sittin' next to the Queen 
Is the closest they'll ever get to Brooklyn
Why ya'll frontin' you know who the best be
I'm the reason why the game so sexy
The originator, the trend creator
Bitch, you dun know you haffa respect me

I know what you think, she's such a fuckin' lady
Yes I am, that's right, I was raised that way

Now if a mon want it, make 'I'm pay down pon it
Mon want it, make 'I'm pay it down
Now if a mon want it, make 'I'm pay down pon it
Mon want it, make 'I'm pay it down

No money no love, sisters, no money no ugh
So don't preach to me 'bout singing
All I want is mah self respect
You see your words don't mean a thing
Show me a man, who never sin yet, uh-uh

The feds pinched me for shootin'
But instead they indicted me for my fuckin' music
This jealous motherfucker and this prosecutin' dyke bitch
Probably go home, listen to How Many Licks
Stay away from 5-0, that's that hiphop cop
These cheese eatin' rodents really got the game caught
You see when you on top, niggas want what you got
Even though they idolize you, they still criticize you

So don't preach to me bout singing , I, I am just a woman
You've got your feelings I got mine, I'm only human
And I gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I've gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I'm tryin' to go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I, gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on

That's just between me and mi God
And if mi waan fi shot out and gwaan like mi bad
That's just up to me

Mon want it, make 'I'm pay it down
Now if a man want it, make 'I'm pay down pon it

Hey throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin' yours
If the rims on his ride ain't as big as yours
You gettin' money what'chu hatin on my niggaz for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and get to gettin' yours
Throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin' yours
If that other bitch's ass ain't as big as yours
You gettin' money what'chu hatin on my bitches for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and get to gettin' yours

Boss lady pull up in the back of the Maybach
Chaffeur behind the wheel, feet up, leaned back
Readin' the newspaper, honeygirl put a hurtin' on 'em
Haters like a bad act, I just close the curtain on 'em
Play all day on the Siruis, radio
Satellite TV, who do it like me?
In designer outfits, while sellin' the tag
Yves Saint Laurent boots, Yves Saint Laurent bag
Keep the Pokeman in case a big bitch think I'm ass
Eatin' through her stomach like a gastric, bypass
Bitch you better buy a pass and you better have the cash
When you in my town you got to see me to buy a pass
Number one rule, think B.I.G.
50 grand for the girl to sit in V.I.P.
The spotlight is on me, I'm the one they wanna see
They give they money to Kim like I'm H.S.B.C.

Yeah, well it's young Dash to all those who don't know
The boy who stay hot when his jewels is so cold
Killer screwface and he cockin' that fo'-fo'
Wanna ice grill? Better holla at Paul Wall
Is all that called for? Whole crew do it up
Champagne, threw it up, 'til niggaz threw it up
Cruisin' up, tinted up, gotta be some star
Don't know what to call it, they say it's a truck car
You been with a chump pah; like Ashton
Was the first one to ""Punk"" y'all
Have yo' ass holy and resemblin Spongebob
Like an old album, you happen to come for us
You guys get dust off
It's the young boss, show you what the imp us for
Family and friends be the only ones missin' boy
Sayin' that you rich and all, tell me what'chu bitchin' for
Maybe cause I'm gettin' mine - well is you gettin' yours?

[Chorus]

You don't really want it with the nigga right in front of Tip
Have you duckin' on the shit, wanna let the burner spit
Get bucked bitch, give a fuck who you run and get
King of the South, Pimp Squad Clique runnin' shit
Bricks in the pipeline, sold in the nighttime
Take a lifetime to find a flow that's quite like mine
40 cal's and 45 glocks, I don't like nine
Mac-9 and automatic flatten niggaz lifeline
I'm already rich, use the rappin as a pastime
Grand Hustle bitch and I ain't settle for the last time
Other niggaz settle down cause I don't bag mine
You see me pull it I'ma blast, I don't flash mine
You niggaz livin' check to check but I don't cash mine
Deposit it and let it sit cause all the cash mine
Been goin easy on you rappers I'ma mash now
Niggaz throw your bottles in the air and put the glass down

Can you see me now? Am I clear to you?
On the red carpet in Mark Jacob's clothes
You see me fashion week, front row at all the shows
In your favorite fashion magazine they feature the Queen
On the cover of Don Divas, doin spreads with Eva
When we walk down the street, dudes call us the covergirls
We stand out when we next to them other girls
I don't bend easy, budge or break
Trust me, ju don't want it with the female Scarface
Your girl come through twirlin in droptop 'Rossa

You see I'm somethin you never seen befo'
I know you see me cause I'm somethin that you came to know, ohh

While you on your grind I'm on, beachfront property
Thirty-eight snub nose, keep the snitches off of me
Look the rest of your life, ain't gon' find a bitch as raw as me
Grateful's what you oughta be, I heard somewhere it cost to be
The boss and I paid it, floss with the greatest
Ball outrageous the broad is amazin
In the 6, grippin woodgrain lane changin
You coach flyin hoes need boss bitch trainin
I'm muy caliente, sizzlin hot flame
In private planes to Spain and you barely maintainin
You ain't talkin millions you ain't speakin my language
The Queen of the game and can't a damn thing change it

Y'all better stand up or sit down, cause I'ma be here
Pull up a beach chair and pop you a Becks beer
I'ma live it up, 'til I'm a hundred with gray hair
Glass house in Bel-Air that's, high up in the mountain

And the last breath leaves my lung, I'll be

But I stood there like what, the Bee don't budge

Words misconstrued and used against you

I had to say it, cause I'm that real with it
You shinin like a star, then you gotta deal with it
And dudes pick to take these groupies to bed
Better watch it 'fore they write a book about like Superhead
Fuck 'em and leave 'em then they after your paper
Put a hole in the condom and say that you raped her
See you can be a rapper, athlete or an actor
Believe me, these devils find a way to get at'cha
All it takes is some green and your face on the screen
Fuck it, just say I took one for the team

And watch for the snakes and the Jakes approachin
'Cause it could be the ones that you laugh and joke wit
The ones you smoke wit, and sold your coke wit
I set you up for the right piece of change
And have your brains on the dashboard of the Range
Too often, I seen a nigga layin in the coffin
All cause some shit was blown out of proportion
Everywhere you go you gotta move with caution
'Cause the rap game ain't much different than the crack game
It's the new hustle, gotta have brains and muscle
Get too much money and these haters wanna touch you
Now I can see why they all on me

But the niggaz in your crew you gotta watch them too

Champagne at my campaign, Kim for mayor
Told you I'm the same bitch from the escalator
And I ain't trippin off you rats and investigators
Get your envelopes, time to address the haters

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Me and my team, we tryin' to own casinos
So we can all cop dreams like Pacino's
Come through in the oh-six Benz-itos
The feds tryin' to shut us down like Nino

We keep it goin man, we keep it goin' man
Won't stop, can't gotta keep it goin' man
See I do it for the fans, they'll never understand
While they goin' off course, me I'm stickin' to the plan

Feel the movement, it's a whole new crew
Fuck Junior M.A.F.I.A., that chapter is through
Them faggots done did somethin' that they can't undo
Whoever ridin' with 'em they can get one too

Could a copped to a one to three do
Still took it to trial, even though I blew
Crooklyn style, that's how we do it
I'll gangsters and ain't got to prove it

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Now a party ain't a party 'til the Queen come through
You know where I go, man the team come too
Pull up in the Phantom or the V-1-2
Lil' Kim's that girl, even got her own shoe

In the club with my clique though, glass full of Crist-al
In the jail jumpsuit, still a bad bitch though
Rose from the ghetto it was hard from the get go
Then I showed the hood the world ain't just made for rich folk

Get ya little dance up, BK stand up
Straight to the dance floor, everybody hands up
Throw it up, get down, fellas hold your pants up
Ladies throw it right back, tell that nigga man up

[Chorus]",Whoa [Pull Club Mix]
Lil' Kim,"If peter piper pecked em, I betcha biggie bust em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically, I dust em, off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers, bitch with that platinum grammer
I am a diamond cluster hustler
Queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch 
Murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease free bitch
Check it, I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A. remember them?
Tell em when I used to mess with gentlemen
Straight up aposttles, now strictly niggaz that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better, Beretta inside of Beretta
Nobody do it better
Bet I wet cha like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eatin my pussy while I watch cartoons
Seat the loon, this rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggaz lives for one point five
While you struggle and strive we pick which Benz to drive
The M.A.F.I.A. you wanna be em
Most of y'all niggaz can't eat without per diem
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch

Uhh, who you lovin who you wanna be huggin
Roll with niggaz that be thuggin, buggin
In the tunnel in Eso's
Sippin espresso, Cappuchino wit Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moscino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
See-note after see-note, Frank Bo hold fifteen plus the caterer
You think you greater, uh
(You niggaz got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch)
Check my pitch, or send it persona
And I'll still stick your moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good ass shot
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sippin Ziffendales, up in Chippendales
Shop in Bloomingdales for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no broblems spittin cream with my team
Shit's straight like nine fifteen, why'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossin my rolex rich 
Shit, I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch

I'm on Myspace and it's type late
My baby got me number one on his top eight
It's computer love, we don't mind to hate
They just MySpace freaks tryna find a date

We up all night havin' cybersex
He chat, I chat though we never met
He said he wanna explore me like the Internet
It's like an orgasm every time he sent a text

He wanna download, he likes to download
Little Kim songs and put 'em on his ringtone
He even got my screen saver on his iPhone
I get more hits than a T inzone

We goin' back and forth, sendin' emails
He a thug so I hit 'em on his Gmail
His sense of humor got me writin' LOL
I sent pictures of myself straight to the cell

He wanna kiss my sexy lips and download me on his floppy disk
Little Kim is the only one on his mind
He wanna come through and put me on his hard drive

Three o'clock in the morning we be online
Others send friend requests but they get denied
He type I miss you
I type back to let him know the feeling's mutual

It's just Myspace love but it's beautiful
He love to watch my videos on YouTube
Hey, it's like everytime I log on I get so turned on
Computer love playin' in the back

The only one that have me up all night long
Feel like a fantasy, the chemistry is so strong

So when you gonna call me? When you gonna come through?
All I wanna do is download, when you gonna let me download?
Shawty up, shawty down low, when you gonna let me download?

And when I see you up close and personal so I can touch you
Ain't nuttin', I don't like you as an insomniac
I'm here now, grab me where my heart dropped at

I meant what I said when I typed that
Lil' mama scream my name if you like that
Ain't nothin' like computer love

How many of us really have one?

I never thought I'd be saying this
But I'll never bring my man around my friends again
Cause the main ones that be hatin' him
Be the same ones tryna get a piece of him
Oh yes they tell me this and they tell me that
I believe what they say
And then I question you
I figured out what they said behind your back
It was a front, just tryna get next to you

Those were the same girls
Who said I should leave you
Those were the same girls
Who said I don't need you
Those were the same girls
Who sat around and dissed you
Those were the same girls
Who said I should quit you
Those were the same girls
Who said you be schemin'
Those were the same girls
Who said they caught you slippin'
But baby now I get the picture
Those were the same girls
That wanted to get wit'cha, hey

I guess I really thought they were really close to me
Tell them everything about you and me
From the sex to the night you wouldn't come home and
To the fights we had in our relationship
I guess they was using it for their gain
Cause they dogged you out and I would do the same
I kept 'em close and my enemies far away
I had it twisted cause I used to hear them say

I could do better than you
I could do better than you
That's what they used to say
Everyday, all day
They was plotting to take you away baby
But now I don't love 'em
I don't trust 'em, I don't see 'em
I don't need 'em
You're what I need, please believe me
I let go of my so-called friends
But I remember when they used to tell me

My supposedly good friends
Who were constantly shady
Who hated all my men
Cause they wanted to be with them
They wanted to walk in my shoes
To see how he do me like he do
They talked about him then
They just wanted to be with him

I'm trying to make this dollar but only got 15 
Where the grass don't grow and birds don't sing 
Where the police be hollering bout my crew

Have me sitting on 20's 'fore I turn 16. 
Wouldn't trade it in for anything 
And I got nothing but love

I got love for these streets and the street got love for me
Gotta keep it gangsta every day 
Can't change what's inside a me so baby can take me out 
The streets but can't take the streets outa me 
I'm gon' still be gangsta (Gangsta) 'cause the streets go right for me.

I've got to say it
How many times?

How many letters would it take?
To make you understand
How many times?
Do I have to reason
With you, so you'll know that I mean it
All that I say
How many times?
Baby, how can I make you realize?

Make yourself invisible
But leave the car here

So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

I made the choice today
See one of us will be leaving
Right now I ain't gonna say

I know that was a lie

What's up with this girl?

Is visiting our house
Each day when I'm at work
I just can't believe you had the nerve
There'll be no more

No more kisses
We won't make it up
I'm tired of your shit
I've had enough
If I had three wishes
You'd see me close my eyes
Real tight I'd concentrate
Like 1-2-3 and

Ta da
Trying to make you disappear
Make ya pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong, the sound I'm waiting for
Your taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door

Vroom!
Won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible
But leave the car here
The pink slips in my name
So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

See one of us has got to go
It's gon' be you 'cause it's my condo
The two of us can't be up in here
So one of us is gonna make it clear

There's no laying 'round, no free rides
No playing around, that's a rule of mine
But you were cheating 'round
Trying to ride for free
If it worked, I'd dream of genie
I'd blink your ass away from me

No more kisses
We won't make it up
I'm tired of your shit
I've had enough
If I had three wishes
You'd see me close my eyes
Real tight I'd concentrate
Like 1-2-3 and

Ta da
Trying to make you disappear
Make ya pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong, the sound I'm waiting for
The taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door

Vroom!
Won't you please disappear?
It's funny but that's what I wanna hear
The pink slips in my name
So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

Ta da
Trying to make you disappear
Make ya pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
The sound I'm waiting for
The taxi's outside
And the driver's at the door

Won't you please disappear?
Make yourself invisible
But leave the car here
The pink slips in my name
So the Benz has gotta stay
Why you stuttering and trying to explain?

Ta da
Trying to make you disappear
Make ya pack your bags
Get the hell out of here
Ding-dong, the sound I'm waiting for

Lil' Mo,"Lying in my bed 
I hear the clock tick and think of you 
Caught up in circles 
Confusion is nothin' new 
Flashbacks, warm nights 
Almost left behind 
Suitcase of memories 
Time after time 

Sometimes, you'll picture me 
I'm walking too far ahead 
You're calling to me 
I can't hear what you've said 
Then you say go slow 
I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds 

[Chorus 1: x2]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting 
Time after time 

After my picture fades 
And darkness has turned to gray 
Watchin' through windows 
You're wondering if I'm okay 
Secrets stolen from deep inside (deep inside) 
The drum beats out of time 

[Chorus 1: x2]

You say go slow 
I fall behind,
The second hand unwinds 

[Chorus 1: x4]

If you're lost, if you fall 
You can look, I'll be waiting",Time After Time

Cause you make it feel like the first time, every time we make love
Then you explore my body babe, don't rush with every touch

Lil' Mo,"You changed me and the way I felt about men 
I was just so disgusted cause the one I loved I couldn't trust him
And you told me that if I never been hurt I would not know what happiness is 
And just how good it feels 

I was scared to give you all of me 
Cause my last love he left me helplessly
Like a bird with out his wings I was just sitting around

Yes I was so afraid
Going through the same thing again baby
I hate it to fall in love cause I have been through so many things I can't name 
Same type, same thing, same game 
But you showed me not to block my heart from every man that came walk up to me 
Cause you were the right one for me 

I was scared to give you all of me 
Cause my last love he left me helplessly
Like a bird with out his wings I was just sitting around

I never thought I would ever find love this 
I had no trust at all cause ever man but you had did me wrong 
Here's a wonderful thang 
Since I let go of my past loves 
I'm glad I gave you a chance to show me you're a good man 

I was scared to give you all of me

You out of line shorty, you bout' to piss me off

You calling me, stalking me, emailing me, telling me my man ain't being true
Said ya had rendezvous, you have the proof 
What the use of me losing my cool, losing my man 
My sanity, cause you miserable
But I trust my man and I love him to

He belongs to me so get over it 
Get over it, leave us be

We're happy , stop stressing me 
He belongs to me so get over it 

You must think your games are gon' ruin my house 
So, I don't trust my man and I'm kicking him out
You say he cares for you, and he's been there for you 
Can you hear your self, you sound like a fool
If what you saying is true, why you telling me 
To get under my skin, to get at me 
Girl you make me say ah ah ah ah ah 
Cause I'm to grown for this and I'ma tell you simple and plain

Lil' Mo,"Back in the day my momma used to tell me 
Girl you gotta stand for something 
Don't fall for nothing not even a piece of god loving
And she would always say 
Always be a leader, a giver, and not a receiver
A dreamer as well a believer
Never a loser, reach your dream 
Someone might try and sell me 
It feels so good to hear her tell me

It's your world baby girl, you can have anything 
Anything that you need, all your hearts desires
Just believe in your dreams, not as hard as it seams 
You can be anything cause it's your world 

Now that I'm grown, I teach these young girls a lesson
Good morals over power over pressure, don't set up for lesser 
Oh will people try and stress ya, thought they talk about they will respect you
Strive for perfection , and keep your head to the sky 
Even thought you want to be down never ever follow 
Always make them follow the leader 
Yo momma won't tell you but lil mo will 
It's your world baby girl, you can have anything 
Anything that you need, all your hearts desires
Just believe in your dreams, not as hard as it seams 
You can be anything cause it's your world

The sky is the limit 
All you can have and more 
As long as you reach for it it's yours

I shoulda known you was too good to be true

Oh

How could I been such a fool
To see something so visible
Guess I was blinded by the physical
And you kept me from being seen with you
Still I guess I couldn't see right through

We always met at a private place
My place or a secret rendezvous
When I asked where you live
You gave the same excuse
I never met your kids
Never been to your crib
Never met your family or friends

I'm convinced but I'm confused

That my perfect gentlemen
Cheated me better than any man

Couldn't better think of someone taking my place
I'd lose my mind, and my will to care
Probably wish that God would take me away from here
Life would be so unfair, I'd never be the same yeah

Oh babe, I don't know what in the world I would do
You'd never really leave me all alone

Probably lose my mind, lose my will to be alive

Never give him someone to turn to at night
Rule number 2
Never bring your man around your crew
Rule number 3
Never call him first let him call you
Rule number 4
Never let him know your every move
Rule number 5
Never tell him about your past
How many other lovers you've had
How many other lovers went bad
Make no exceptions

If you want to keep your man whipped
Follow my 10 commandments
And he'll keep coming back for more
And more and more

Rule number 7
Never move in unless he tell you
Rule number 8
Never tell your friends about your bedroom 
Rule number 9
Never let them know his shoe size
Rule number 10
Should have been rule number 1
'cause If you give in on the first night
Make sure you ride that thing
Scream his name
And he'll be yours for life
'cause you know your excited
(Cos you know your excited)
And you just can't fight it
And you wanna tell all your friends
But you've got to make sure loves intact
Because you want him to keep coming back 

[Chorus: x2] 

There's never no such thing as giving him to much
'cause if you want to wed with your man
You can never give enough
'cause you get excited
And wanna tell everybody
But you've got to make sure
Loves intact
Then it will help you bring him back

[Lil Kim] 
I've been in this thing for years
It made me an animal
Me and my girl
Mo wrote you'll a manual
Step by step booklet for you to keep
Your man in place 
And out the next girls' face
Rule number 1
Never give a dude money
Girl don't be a dummy
Let the homie stay bummy
'cause once he start,
He don't stop, 
That's it
And all he gonna do is spend it on the next chic
Rule number 2 
Before you give him some
It's your way
Shop in a new car
Now that what I call for play
Now don't get me wrong
Respect your man
But if dude gets out of line 
Then check your man
Rule number 3
Should have been rule number 1
Never go down
Till he licks you round
Your neck, your back, your puss and ass crack 
Rule number 4, 5 and 6
Very important lessons
Keep your man guessing
Never let him see you stressing
And if you love here's 7, 8, 9 and 10
Never ever ever mess with his friend
See if you follow these
You'll have mad red to breaka house on the beach
And mad trips to jaca
He'll be home at night cooking you a steaka
And he'll keep coming back for more
On the wake up 

[Chorus: x2] 

Understand If you want to keep your man
And you want to hold on to him
Keep your man whipped
Follow my 10 commandments
Ha
You got it
Ha
Keep coming back for more

More and more and more",Ten Commandments

You can say it, if you don't mean it 
You can buy it, if you don't need it 
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what's the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?

They say only fool's fall in love, but love was meant for all of us
So what we think we know we don't, cause you can never know enough
Do we think love is so material so physical, and sensual
Cause in the war it will destroy your soul, so one really knows 

It can make you laugh 
Make you cry
Make you tell the truth 
Make you tell a lie 
It could be your life 
Or it could be your death
Figure it out, it makes no sense

You can feel it, but you can't see it
You can't taste it, but you can hear it 
You can say it, if you don't mean it 
You can buy it, if you don't need it 
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what's the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?

We think love is perpetual, but the one who loves you will let you go
The pleasure that is imaginable, it will make you leave a happy home 
But all we take is love for serious, do we really know what it means to us
Cause if it wasn't for love we wouldn't be born, but no one really ever knows

Why it puts us together, it tears us apart
It can even mend it, or break your heart 
What we have for our self, what you say to your child 
But I still wonder why 

You can feel it, but you can't see it
You can't taste it, but you can hear it 
You can say it, if you don't mean it 
You can buy it, if you don't need it 
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what's the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?

Physical affection, emotions 
Feelings, honest
Wanting, opposites of desire 
Longing, needing
Craving, lusting
Baby you light my fire 
Graduation, kissing
Hugging, touching
Yearning, sexing 
Mother to her child
These are the thing that we really need 
When we talk about this thing called love 

You can feel it, but you can't see it
You can't taste it, but you can hear it 
You can say it, if you don't mean it 
You can buy it, if you don't need it 
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what's the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?

You can feel it, but you can't see it
You can't taste it, but you can hear it

It makes no sense, so what's the reason

Lil' Mo,"If you could blow up the world with the flick of a switch
Would you do it?
If you could make everybody poor just so you could be rich
Would you do it?
If you could watch everybody work while you just lay on your back
Would you do it?
If you could take all the love without giving any back
Would you do it?
And so we cannot know ourselves or what we'd really do

With all your power
With all your power
With all your power
What would you do?

If you could make your own money and then give it to everybody
Would you do it?
If you knew all the answers and could give it to the masses
Would you do it?
No no no no no no are you crazy?
It's a very dangerous thing to do exactly what you want
Because you cannot know yourself or what you'd really do

With all your power
With all your power
With all your power
What would you do?",Yeah Yeah Yeah
Lil' Mo,"Trying to think of us feels like
'Cause I don’t really know what it is
I don’t know just where to begin and
Tell you are sides to win
Think I’m gonna start right here

Just when I thought about giving up
When I was about to run on me
That’s when you pulled up to my heart
And said you wanna ride with me
And it was something about you that I see so different
Something so different, something that I never felt
Something that I never felt
But now it feels like I lost myself trying to find you
Feels like I’m living the life of you
And now it’s time to tell the truth

I love me, I love me, more than I love you
Yes I do, hey baby, yeah, yeah
I love me, somebody what I’m talking bout
More than I love you
Tweet you gotta tell me
Sing this song, sing this song

I’m tired of walking a thin line
And hitting walls of regret
It’s better that we call it quiz
Think we need to stop right there
Just when I thought about giving up
When I was about to run on me
That’s when you pulled up to my heart
And said you wanna come and ride with me
And sharing love with you seemed so innocent
Even heaven sent, everything I ever dreamed
It feels like I … myself, now I love you
It’s like I’m stretching…the truth
It’s time to turn

I love me, I love me, more than I love you
I love me, I love me, more than I love you
Yes I do, hey baby, yeah, yeah,

Be'Cause you’ve changed, I no longer give to you
Love remains here with me, here with me, here with me
And I made it through the pain and now 
I finally see, so clearly, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, I love me so much more than I love you
More than I love you,to love me more
I love me more than I love you
More than you, more than I love you
I know it may sound crazy,more than I love you
'Cause you’re a good man, just not good for me
It’ my apology, I gotta immediately
Don’t worry about the house, you can have it
Don’t worry about the cars, you can drive them
I’ll got get another one, because I got it",I Love Me
Lil' Mo,"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love har taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
The turn around and leave again

This love har taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love har taken it's toll on me

Lil' Ron,"[Talking]
That's a set back, you know I'm saying man
Lil' Red, way back in the motherfucking cut man
Nigga was like shit nigga, I was like what come on man

[Scarface]
Street lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
And moving slowly in silence, steady making sho' my hustle
Is air tight, these city streets is hectic gotta get it here
Tomorrow ain't a promise to me, so I don't live in fear
I work until I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, re-up and that's when I bleed it
The soldier could never see me, as being some'ing that's lesser
A nigga straight out the gutter, murdered without a question
Product of my surroundings, click it clack it and and down him
All they know is he missing, but niggaz ain't never found him
I'm sorry but still in yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a motherfucking killer, for realer this ain't a threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets, and my advice to you is live your life
And never when niggaz might, hit you under city lights
So get it right (never know)
You never know when niggaz might, hit you under city lights get it right

[Hook - 2x]
Lord forgive me, cause I know I ain't living right
Still I gotta make some'ing happen, under them street lights
But pay attention, let me show you what my life like
You can get your days cut short, under them street lights

[Yung Redd]
Them folks got me under the scope, cause I ain't living right
Still I ain't the one to provoke, dog you get it right
20 inch shoes when I cruise, under them city lights
Careful with the road I choose, cause you can lose your life
I'm praying and hoping, I never get caught in the moment
Shot from a glock, that's smoking from not scoping
When a nigga told me, you don't work you don't eat
So I'm slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet
And my pop, was a rolling stone
15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own
Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone
A long way from home, on this road I roam
Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us
Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa
Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference
So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil Ron]
Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic
Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted
That's tragic, happened right on my block
I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot
So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me
Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese
Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on
Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone
But hold on, trash talking ain't my game
Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range
Peep this it ain't a secret, them laws ain't right
They like to catch a late night, living the life
That's why I'm on top of my game, always thinking twice
Don't get it twisted, I still got a mean right
But most of the time, my nigga I'm on chill
It's real in the field, it's easy to get killed

When I fall in love
I'm falling in love 
Nothing in this world could take you away
'Cause when I fall in love

I'm falling in love
Baby don't you know I'm always here to stay
I'm always here to stay

Go ahead

Our days
I've got nothing else to say

Before you loose control
Take my body and my soul
I will give myself to you
So tell me that your love is true
Give me love I've never heard, don't turn your back

'Cause when I hold you close to me
I can't let go
I've fallen under your spell
I got to let you know

That when I hear your voice
I know I won't let go
My love is for real, so baby
Please don't go

[Chorus:] 

All of me, all of me for you
No time to waste, got things to do
Don't even deny the way we feel 
My heart is true, my love is real

Fall in love with me tonight

Momma told me there'd be days like this

Never question the woman's intuition 
My ambition is to give you what you miss 
Sweet love 
Take off your shoes  come and get your feet rubbed 
Us in the tub 
That'll be the shit 
Anybody that don't believe this can eat a dick 
I think we soul mates 
'Cause we got so much in common 
You make them hoes wait 
When you find the proper woman 
Then next to me 
Put your head on my chest 
Attraction stimulates me 
But it's not all about the sex 
I respect you got a mind 
And you self sufficient 
Opinonate yet know how to listen 
Now what's mine is yours 
If I'm ballin' you ballin' 
Tell that other nigga 
He can stop callin' 
Check this out

I want to be your man 

I want to be your man baby 
I'm talkin' about 
Providing you with all the lights, securities 
I mean, I think the first step is 
Going to pick out some rings 
What you like 
Baggets and pistol skirts 

Can't spend a life 
Without giving you my answer tonight 
Cause I gotta catch a early flight 
What you yellin' about 
The simple fact that I'm bailin' out 
I'm makin' moves 
My record sellin' out 
I need some affection 
Love can you teach me a lesson 
I might be sittin' fat down here in Texas 
But the thugs ain't mean 
So how deep is your love for me 
How real do you cut for me 
If the laws came and got me 
How long were you stuck with me 
If not long then don't fuck with me 
I want you down on my team 
And support 
When I'm tryin' to make my green 
It's for real 
I throws some karats in your ring 
I'll make it last forever 
'Cause you know 
I had that cash forever 
We can ball till pass together baby 
Where the love at

Yeah that nigga Lil' Troy

Puttin' down like a G yo 
That's how we get our groove on 

Recognize the mobb 
I bet you cold working star 
When they see the flowers that I'm sendin' to your job 
Read the cards 
Stick it in your purse 
Let's keep it rosy 
'Cause everybody so nosy 
So you can't believe what people say 
Misery, loves company tell them keep away 
It'll be okay 
If you trust in me to make it right 
Before I hit you I'll ?? 
That's on my baby's life 
Will you be my wife 
Please take this ring 
And a service to token 
To make you realize baby I ain't jokin' 
I'm coping 
But my adversaries got me ?? 
I need a god-feared woman 
Who understands my heart 
Leave your baggage from past relationships 
Out of the picture 
I put my old flames out I done changed 
All of my digits 
And that's real 

[Chorus] 

I want to be your man 
Sober 
Ain't really no need to question me 
????? 
For my loyalty or my commitment life 
You know my presence 
But you alone 
To let you know 
You don't want to mess with me 
You need to spend time with me 

I bring the heat 
You want to play 
It ain't a thing ?? 
You say you changed 
You look the same to me 
Eat and ball too much 
On the real, cause I done stall too much 
Girl I want you all too much 
Ain't no way in the world 
Me and you an ball too much 
Imagine having cabbage 
Straight lavish 
Friends wish they can have it 
'Cause I push a rolez, sip crystal glasses 
I'm all wet 
Don't listen to your friends about me cheatin' 
They don't' know that 
Your best friend want me 
Tell that hoe that 
For show that 
You know she want the kids 
You should have knew this 
True this 
Two real niggas left 
I'm one of the fewest 
Holla at me girl

But for now I'm gettin' new money like I told ya.

Reeds game full of ice lot of cars like Tonka
My swag is awesome, awesome and I run it like Boston
Flashy like Rondo, got a bash full of bad girls sittin’ in the condo
Twizzy half the head honcho shoutout CC ablejacks in da londo!
Six swags see the real whip past got the chicks wanna to ride me like Six Flags
G4, G5 switchbacks
