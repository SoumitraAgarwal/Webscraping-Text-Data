Marillion,"The rock-star trip. Some serious ship
White-knuckle journey blackened my
Eye & cut my lip
Better to be a doctor or a man who
Walks the earth
Hedonistic laughing boys
What's any of it worth?

Look at myself
Look at myself

Escaped to this car
Drove to a bar somewhere
The beautiful game
Such a thin line between love & hate

Look at myself
Look at myself

Mr Taurus ate a thesaurus
Made the girls cry & skipped straight
To the chorus
Mr Taurus had a great fall
All the King's horses were no good
At all
No good at all

Here's one I broke earlier
I broke earlier

Woke up in a spaceship of shimmer
Ing gold
Tutenkhamen sleeping
Should'a left him alone
Floating round in Orion
Arrow pointing to heaven
Between all the planets
Out in the cold

Everyone I love
Everyone I love
Everyone I love lives somewhere else
And I have time to look at myself
Look at myself
Look at myself

And I've seen enough
I've seen enough
Everyone I love lives somewhere else
Everyone I love lives somewhere else

Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else

Marillion,"A voice from the past
Entered my head today
Fresh & alive. Full of life, passion
And pain.
A voice now past.
A beautiful soul. Gone, gone, gone.

Speaking clearly - clearer than
The living
Talking perfect sense
Used to not being understood
While talking perfect sense to the
Next generation

Have we caught up yet?
Is it time?
I think it is.
Enough is enough
Enough is enough

A voice from the past
Entered my head today
Tiny child sighed in my ear.
Giving up breathing in
Over & out
Over & out
Taken by bad luck & the ill fortune
Of geography.

Common cold. Dirty water. HIV.
Common apathy. Common crime.
Perfect nonsense to the next
Generation

Dead yet alive
Dead yet alive
Gone but shouting anger
Gone but talking perfect sense

Have we caught up yet?
Is it time? Well I say it is. I say it is.
Deaf & dumbed-down
Enough is enough

Give me a smile. Hold out your hand.
I don't want your money
I don't want your land
Gimme a smile. Hold out your hand.
I don't want your money
I don't want your land
I want you to wake up & do
Something strange
I want you to listen
I want you to feel someone else's pain
Someone else's pain
Someone else's pain
Someone else's pain.

Marillion,"I've done everything that can be done to heal this wound
Left it on it's own for years

I've done everything that can be done to heal this wound
Left it on it's own for years
Couldn't touch it, didn't pick it, didn't get it wet
It didn't stop the bleeding

I bandaged it, I wrapped it, stitched it, tourniqueted it
I held it stiff & aching in the air
Held it there til I went beserk
Didn't sleep
It didn't work
Didn't stop it weeping

And the wound is your life
And your life took on a life of it's own
(Or so you foolishly thought)
And your life rolled on over me Bang-Bang like 56 train wheels
Every time I heard news of you

And the wound was in every lousy song on the radio

And the pain was like a tree-fern in the dark, damp, forgotten places
Darkness didn't stop her growing
New-born baby cells dividing..
Curled up tight unrolling day by day
Stretching up, stretching out
Forming the same identical shape
Clones. There ain't too much sadder than
Clones - relentlessly emerging from the hairy heart of the wound

And the fern is beautiful in it's own way
Uncurling in the dark
Beautiful with no one there to see it
As the would weeps & aches

(Now there's some sad things known to the man from the planet Marzipan)",The Wound
Marillion,"I gazed upon you from the bleachers
A creature so foreign to me
With the stars and the stripes wrapped around you
Well how could I know there was England below?
I gazed upon you and I wondered
Cheerleader with hair of red flame
But that was first glance, I saw only the dance
And the distance from New York to Yorkshire

Truth's always stranger than fiction
And here it's especially true
Here in the home of Miss USA
What's a wide-eyed English boy going to do?

I never knew much about baseball
But I was quick with the US cliché
The crowd gave a roar and I don't know what for
The Major League rules get me so confused

Truth's always stranger than fiction
The cheerleader showed me around
You with the heart of the USA
And me with the spite of a small English town

Central Park after dark, is safe these days
Depending on the game you play.

America, house of Blues
What do you know?
Gimme the news.

America, shock and awe.
Not any more.

Tell me what to do
Tell me what to do.",Especially True
Marillion,"I am the man from the planet Marzipan
Good to see you
My eyes are screwed up tight, unaccustomed to the light
And all my arms and all my legs are much too long
Much too long

My head is in a state, unaccustomed to the weight
I wear this mild expression, I'm an alien to aggression
Music only does me in my skins so thin

There's so much that I can't take in
There's so much that I can't take in
There's so much that I daren't take in

Can you feel through my skin to me?
Can you feel through my skin to me?

Throw a tarpaulin over me
I look like a rotary washing line
I am the face of 2069
I have trouble with my breathing
My net-curtain lungs
And the thoughtlessness of other people's careless tongues

The air's so thin
Oh my skin
The air's so thin
Oh my skin

I am the man from the planet Marzipan
My eyes are screwed up tight, unaccustomed to the light
I wear this mild expression, I'm an alien to aggression

The air's so thin
Oh my skin
Oh my skin..

I'm so close..
I'm so close to a breakdown
A constant crisis in the heart

What the hell is going on here?
Earth creatures. Amazing, beautiful and mad.
Monkeys trying to be stars
Monkeys carrying their Gods around
Lies and murder in the name of heaven
Seen it all before in the kindergartens of the Universe
It would be quaint if it wasn't so damned scary

I can't listen and I can't watch
I can see inside the machine
I can see the join! I can see the join.

Can you feel through my skin to me?
Can you see through my skin?
It's all here in my skin, you see
It's all here in my skin,
Here in my skin!

Time comes around, out of my hands
Small boats on the beach at the dead of night

Leave me running in the wheel

What is there to feel

And how do we now come to be
Afraid of sunlight

Were scared of sunlight

How do we now come to be
Afraid of sunlight
Tell me girl, why you and me

Been in pain for so long
I can't even say what hurts anymore
I will leave you alone, I will deny
I will leave you to bleed, I will leave you with your life

So how do we now come to be
Afraid of sunlight
Tell me girl, why you and me
Were scared of sunlight

All your spirit rack abuses
Come to haunt you back by day
All your byzantine excuses
Given time, give you away

So don't be surprised when daylight comes
To find that memory prick your thumbs
You'll tell them where to run to hide
I'm already dead, it's a matter of time
It's a matter of time

So how do we now come to be
Afraid of sunlight
Tell me if you're aware you an' me

Marillion,"How long can you stand
Tightening up
Avoiding the fight
Avoiding the truth
Tighten the smile
Tighten the lie
Will you get what you want
To be cursed with your dreams
I hope for your sake
Something gets in the way

How long can you stand
Living under the lens
The kiss of success
The ensuing, all consuming, mess

Message of love
They arrive everyday
People you touch
Wasting away
People you don't know
Give you no choice

And you're sick to your stomach
At the sound of your voice
And the shape of your face
And the sound of your name
They send you pictures of yourself
It's someone you don't know
And they call you a genius
Cause you're easier to sell
But the fire in your belly
That gave you the songs
Is suddenly gone
And you feel like a fake
Is that what you want?
I hope for your sake..
You've got what it takes
You've got what it takes
You've got what it takes

Marillion,"I'm the man of a thousand faces
A little piece of me in every part I take
I hold the tape for a thousand races
A different point of view in every speech I make
Cut me a piece of my divided soul
Cry me a river, call it rock and roll
Give me an attitude and watch me make it lie
Pass me a microphone
I need to testify

Well I speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak to the present in the past and future tense
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience

I'm the man of a thousand ages
You see my face in the stones of the Parthenon
You hear my song in the babble of Babylon
I'm the man of a thousand riches
Be my guest at the feast of Satyricon
You spend the money that my logo's printed on

Well I'll speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak to the present in the past and future tense
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience

I stole a fire but it burned up much too soon
I took a leap and I landed on the moon
Look at my life and it looks like CNN
You see something once
You know it's gonna come around again

Well I'll speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak to a woman with the fatal charm of a snake
Forgive like a giver and account for all I take
Yes, I speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak like a leader with the voice of power and command

Marillion,"He's seen too much of life
And there's no going back
The loneliness calls him
And the edge which must be sharpened
He's losing it. And he knows.
But there's a fighter in his mind and his body's tough
The years have been unkind but kind enough

The smell of the earth
It's his favourite smell
But he's somehow compelled to the stinging salt hell
To the place where he hurts and he's scared
And there's no one to tell
And no one who doesn't listen

""You can take all the boys and the girls in the world
And I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud
I've seen too much of life
So the sea is my wife and a sweet Ocean Cloud is a mistress I'm allowed
For now.""

""You can take all the boys and the girls in the world

For now.""

""Only me and the sea
We will do as we please.""

He remembers the day he was marched to the front
By the physical knuckle head teacher of games
'Look lads' he declared, ""This boy's a cream puff
No guts and no muscles
No spine and no stuffing""
The whole schoolroom sniggered
And silently thanked God it wasn't them..

But time is revenge. All the bullies grow weak
And must live with faithless women who despise them
I'll be in Barbados in a couple of weeks
With a rum on the table and yarns by the yard
A story to tell and a story to save
..unless she changes her mind
I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud
I've seen to much of life so the sea is my wife
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my boat tonight

The wind changed
I felt it run beneath my ear
Like silk drawn across my neck
A dream of your legs
Defying gravity in love

The medium wave
Brought signals here from far away
Your tender voice riding on the sea spray
Something in the air
For those who know the signs
Something in the air
A storm..

When I was alive
When I was alive
Don't wanna remember
When I was alive

Watch me watch me
Paint this picture

Watch me
Takin it Takin it Takin it Takin it....
Watch me. Watch me. God above..

Between two planets
In between the points of light
Between two distant shorelines
Here am I

Between two planets
In the black daylight of space
Between two heavenly bodies
The invisible man.

I want to be alone

Marillion,"Well, she tied me to the headboard with a surf leash
And her wet hair hugged her body like a long lost friend
And I really tried my best to get across to her
But nothing she would say could be defended

Well, her birthday suit, it was her only present
When I looked into her eyes, no history
And I told her eating people wasn't pleasant
But she laughed a snake eye laugh and walked away from me

And I watched her as she walked across the coals
I watched her as she walked across the coals
I watched her as she walked across the coals

To be reached, she was too far out there

She was singing, I was born in nineteen sixty weird

And the waves rolled in across the bay
And the fabulous brightly colored birds
Flew up out of the forest

And she said, ""Well, we're all heaven's
Beautiful children living together in paradise
Lie down my dear, you're going to enjoy this""

Marillion,"Did you cry when they dragged you home?
Put a lock on the door and the telephone
Was a runaway girl all they could see?

Have the nights and the days that you've come through
Made the right seem wrong and the false seem true
Was a runaway girl all they could see?
A teenage extra from the satellite TV

Runaway girl
Too bad, too bad
Runaway girl
Too wild, too wild

Were they deaf to the prayer behind your lies?
Maybe they didn't dare to ask you why
Was a runaway girl all they chose to see?

You're tryin' to make your mind up if you're better off

You pretend to wait for washing in some Laundromat
But you're damned if you'll give them the satisfaction of you going back
You'd freeze to death before you'd share a roof with them
And you'd starve before you'd let him get his hands on you again

Like the past in a present

And you can't have them back
Because the time for them has gone
And their time has gone with them

An echo of  the time they were wrapped in

Marillion,"And it was morning.
And I found myself mourning,
For a childhood that I thought had disappeared.
I looked

Out the window,
And I saw a magpie in the rainbow, the rain
Had gone
I'm not alone, I turned to the mirror,

I saw you, the child, that once loved.
The child before they
Broke his heart,
Our heart, the heart that I believed was

Lost.
Hey you, surprised? More than surprised,
To find the answers to the questions,
Were always in your

Own eyes.
Do you realize that you give it on back to her?
But that would only be retraced in all the problems that you ever knew,
So untrue.

For she's got to carry on with her life,
And you've got to carry on with yours.
So I see it's me, I can
Do anything

And still the child,
'Cause the only thing misplaced was direction
And I found
Direction.

There is no Childhood's End.
There is no Childhood's End.
'Cause you are my childhood
Friend.

'Cause' you are my childhood friend.
Oh lead me on.
Hey you, you've survived.
Now you've arrived,

To be reborn in the shadow of the
Magpie.
Now you realize, that you've got to get out of
Here.

You've found the leading light of destiny,
Burning in the ashes of your memory.
You want to change
The world.

You'd resigned yourself to die a broken rebel,
But that was looking backward.
Now you've found the
Light.

You, the child that once loved,
The child before they broke his heart.
The heart, the heart
That I believed was lost

So it's me I see, I can do
Anything.
I'm still the child.

Only thing misplaced was direction, and I found direction.

And I don't give a damn, for the fleet street aficionados

I don't want launderette anonymity
I want my hand prints in the concrete on Sunset Boulevard
A dummy in Tussauds, you'll see

Incommunicado, incommunicado
Incommunicado, incommunicado

I'm a marquee veteran a multi-media bonafide celebrity
I've got an allergy to Perrier, daylight responsibility
I'm a rooting tooting cowboy, a Peter Pan with street credibility
Always taking the point with the dawn patrol fraternity

Sometimes it seems like, I've been here before
When I hear, opportunity kicking in my door
Call it synchronicity, call it 'Deja Vu'
I just put my faith in destiny, is the way that I choose

But, I don't want to be a tin can tied
To the bumper of a wedding Limousine
Or currently residing in the where are they now file
A toupee on the cabaret scene
I wanna do adverts for American Express cards
Talk shows on prime time TV
A villa in France, my own cocktail bar
And that's where you're gonna find me

On a Sunday in Milwaukee in the rain
Tryin' to piece together conversations
Tryin' to find out where to lay the blame

But when it comes right down to it there's no use tryin' to pretend
For when it gets right down to it there's no one here that's left to blame
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me
We're just sugar mice in the rain

I heard Sinatra callin' me down through the floorboards
Where you pay a quarter for a partnership in rhyme
To the jukebox cryin' in the corner
While the waitress is countin' out the time

For when it gets right down to it there's no use tryin' to pretend
For when it gets right down to it there's no one really left to blame
Blame it on me, oh you can blame it on me
We're just sugar mice in the rain

'Cause I know what I feel, know what I want, I know what I am
Daddy took a rain check
'Cause I know what I want, know what I feel, I know what I need
Daddy took a rain check, your Daddy took a rain check
Ain't no one in here that's left to blame but me
Blame it on me, blame it on me

Well the toughest thing that I ever did was talk to the kids on the phone
When I heard them asking questions I knew that you were all alone
Can't you understand that the government left me out of work?
I just couldn't stand the looks on their faces sayin', 'What a jerk!'

So if you want my address it's number one at the end of the bar
Where I sit with the broken angels
Clutchin' at straws and nursin' our scars
Blame it on me, blame it on me

Marillion,"On promenades where drunks propose
To lonely arcade mannequins
Where ceremonies pause
At the jewelers shop display
Feigning casual silence
In strained romantic interludes
Till they commit themselves
To the muted journey home

And the pool player rests on another cue
Last nights hero picking up his dues
A honeymoon gambled on a ricochet
She's staring at the brochures at the holidays
Chalking up a name in your hometown
Standing all your mates to another round
Laughing at the world till the barman wipes away
The warm wet circles, the warm wet circles

I saw teenage girls like gaudy moths
A classrooms shabby butterflies
Flirt in the glow of stranded telephone boxes
Planning white lace weddings from smeared hearts
And token proclamations
Rolled from stolen lipsticks
Across the razored webs of glass

Sharing cigarettes with experience
With her giggling jealous confidantes
She faithfully traces his name
With quick bitten fingernails
Through the tears of condensation
That'll cry through the night
As the glancing headlights of the last bus
Kiss adolescence goodbye

In a warm wet circle
Like a mothers kiss on your first broken heart
A warm wet circle
Like a bullet hole in central park
A warm wet circle
And I'll always surrender
To the warm wet circles

She nervously undressed
In the dancing beams of the Fidra lighthouse
Giving it all away before it's too late
She'll let a lovers tongue move in, in a warm wet circle
Giving it all away, showing no shame
She'll take a mother's kiss
On her first broken heart, a warm wet circle
She'll realize that she played her part in a warm wet circle","Warm Wet Circles [7"" Version]"

The DJ resigned today they wouldn't let him have his say
Surface scratched where the needles play, Uzis on a street corner

Terror in Rue de St. Denis, murder on the periphery
Someone else in someone else's pocket
Christ knows I don't know how to stop it
Poppies at the cenotaph, the cynics can't afford to laugh
I heard in on the telegraph there's Uzis on a street corner

I'm uptight, can't sleep at night, I can't pretend everything's all right
My ideals, my sanity, they seem to be deserting me
But to stand up and fight I know we have six million reasons

They're burning down the synagogues, Uzis on a street corner
The heralds of the holocaust, Uzis on a street corner
The silence never louder than now, how quickly we forgot our vows
This resurrection we can't allow, Uzis on a street corner

Where swastikas are spat from aerosols

Trying to score but nobody's pushing
And everyone looks at everyone's faces
Searching for signs and praying for traces of a conscience in residence
Are we sitting on a barbed wire fence
Racing the clouds home, racing the clouds home

We place our faith in human rights
In the paper wars that tie the red tape tight
I know that I would rather be out of this conspiracy
In the gulags and internment camps frozen faces in nameless ranks
I know that they would rather be standing here besides me

I can feel the outside feeding on my inside
Leaves a growing darkness in it's place

I think I have become one of the lonely
Now that everybody talks to me
I feel I have become one of the empty

Hollow men can take you without even reaching out
Hollow men have got you long before you realise

The poison paralyses

I think I have become one of a pair of men

I look down upon myself and watch my movements
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised

Find us anywhere you look
Come and meet our friends
Stand us in our silly clothes
Put our batteries in
Line us up like fairground ducks
Watch us grin and grin
See the lies behind our eyes
See the will to win
We'll buy you and we'll sell you
But perhaps we'll save your skin

Falling towards something out of control
Unable to miss like the man in a tram

For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night

When you can't really function you're so full of fear

Marilyn Manson,"The ancient pharaohs were not too bright they say,
But they made one contribution that I live by to this day,
It's the food pyramid,
And its approved the USDA

Oh grains of the foundation,
So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll

Die!

Marilyn Manson,"Paranoid, sitting in a deep sweat
Thinking I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head 
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place with me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I've wasted
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a fuck
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

Lookin through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peepin tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I cut you""
Opened her legs and commenced the fucking
She begged me not to kill her so I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat and watched her shake till her eyes closed
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit
When they're fucking with a mind of a lunatic

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Dreaming of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in the circle 
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies being fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's going nuts
Boys used to die when I'm full fo that fry
I be ebbin when I'm high 
So I say 'fuck' and just let bullets fly
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with sucidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo get a grip
And bitch, better come equipped, ain't taking no shit 
Cause here comes a mind of a lunatic

My girl's getting skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standing there, she was screaming out
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on granny's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my 38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says Freeze, mutherfucker ! Bitch, suck my dick
(Mind of a lunatic)
I said, ""Die muthafucker !"" as I blasted 
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dying from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A ragin psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded 
Hunted for a way to get out - and I found it
Innocent bystanders watch me set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these mutherfuckers coming with me""
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up, in an asylum
Being treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought up in the mind of a lunatic

Janurary 5th 1969
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I shoulda been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behaviour
Fuck with me, and I'll slay your ass 
Beyond recognition, shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talking to borden
You'll never find a mutherfucker, so save your milk cartons
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, and crazy, don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushing up daisies
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

I ain't got it all, so don't fuck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your mutherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked 
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold of some E&J
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene

And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together; I will fill it alone

Weap my claws round your mouth tight

Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

Don't you? Don't you?

Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not, you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain

Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!

The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?

Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop

Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droppin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,

Marilyn McCoo,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Marilyn McCoo,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever

The best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends

I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love

You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin

Filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

With you I'll always have a friend

You for having faith in me",You Make Me Feel Brand New
Marilyn Michaels,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air.

September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you

Of slaves around you to hound you and swear

This one thing I know
When love goes wrong
A man takes flight
And women get uppity-oh

The moon don't shine
The tide don't ebb and flow
A clock won't strike
A match won't light

And day is dark as night
A man ain't fit to live with
And a woman's sorry sight

Nothing goes right
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes right
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes, nothing goes right

A man goes out, gets high as a kite
Love is something you just can't fight
You can't fight it, honey
You can't fight it
When love goes wrong, nothin'
No bows, honey, just cigat bars and off
Nothing goes right

Marilyn Monroe,"A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello

I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants,
I never get the chance, this is a fine romance!

A find romance, my friend this is
To lack half the thrills that a healthy crime has
We don't have half the thrills

I'll never fall again
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again

And so I'm through with love

I'll keep my feelings there
I've stocked my heart
With icy, frigid air
And I mean to care for no one
Because I'm through with love

Why did you lead me to think you could care?
You didn't need me, you had your share
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear
With deep emotion, devotion to you

Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me
It can never bring the thing that used to be
For I must have you or no one
And so I'm through with love

The way you're acting lately makes me doubt 
You is still my baby, baby 

Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

he's gone and made a change

Or is my baby still my baby true ",Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

After it brought my lover near

Marilyn Scott,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

J'suis un zèbre élevé au couscous, oui en moi y'a du m'boli
Bâtard vas-y dépanne un bon pt'cit coup
J'reste solidaire comme (?)
On va te faire courir même avec une arme factice
Aujourd'hui les meufs ont toutes le profil d'une actrice
J'suis pas le genre mec à céder à tes caprices

(Marin Monster)
Ce n'est que le début!

D'où je suis je vois les choses, dans le ciel je lévite
Se méprend pour son soss, pourtant rien que je l'évite
Dégage, devant nous tu t'effaces
On va te foutre à poil, décale
On t'as pris tout tes fans, miskine

J'ai l'beau, étrange, le flow qu'arrive à scier l'triangle de bermudes
J'vais tous vous faire disparaître pour X raisons, là ça devient rude
J'te vois et c'est pas idem, normal j'suis camouflé dans la brume
T'as l'habitude de t'faire lécher, tu roules du bout de la fac on t'fume
Tout ces pains autour de moi sont certifiés par Paul
La chance tu la vois pas venir, même en ayant une coupe une bol
Se faire niquer par une chatte, ça fait un mal de chien
Quand t'es seul rien qu'tu aboies, mais bizarrement là j'vois qu'tu miaules hein
Se prendre en photo, montrer son boule, est-ce vraiment l'objectif?
Dédipix à 14 ans, à poil, réunion collective
Moi c'que j'pense de toi, j'devrais le censurer
Même bloqué dans l'ascenseur, j'ferai pas la sangsue
Sincèrement j'te le dis, même sans sucer
J'ai de la fierté, oui j'en suis sûr, j't'aurais pas lâché en plein succès
Et merde, l'heure est grave fiston
Pour prier au premier rang à la mosquée, on y accède par pistons

D'où je suis je vois les choses, dans le ciel je lévite

Bonsoir, dehors, j'arrive dans l'game, j'ai déjà fait deux morts
Equipe, del-bor, swaggy-swaggé, non non, tex-vor
Pas besoin de textes gores, par ma voix j't'exhorte
Pas longtemps qu'on est dans l'game, pourtant rien qu'on met des scores
Double MC rime avec import export
C'est pas les fonds de vos caisses mais les fonds marins nous qu'on extorque
Ça jacte trop dans mon davo, autant que 600 pouls
Normal on devient gênant comme un kist dans le boule
Depuis x temps on maintient la distance sans résistance
Authentique et chavo comme l'été d'Istambul

Quand on kick il faut s'taire, on vient d'un milieu austère

Je ne t'épargnerai ap, mais si tu dis qu'on est ensemble
D'où j'viens ça kick sévère et c'est vrai tu t'es dis bon sang
Ça fait des années, des années que ces mecs font du bon son
Chaque morceau qu'on ai-f, la prod est laissé en sang
Fais pas la meuf alors que t'es roulé comme feuille de papier Canson
On s'en beurre d’t'a life, j'te dis que j'peux pas de ta saquer
Gifle dans ta gueule même avec le pied d'un sac
J'suis pas un arracheur qui est pris la mains dans le sac

Depuis tout petit j'mets des tarifs

Génération KFC, les p'tis ont la mentalité bolossé
Quand tu leur parles d'aller bosser ils te disent ""chut j'fume mon shit""
Oh shit j'en ai assez de ce monde insensé
Prends ça de la main droite, la gauche me sert à pointer du doigt tous les cailleras
Balances qui veulent niquer mon ter-ter sur cette Terre
MMC m'a pas encore blindé les poches de dollars mais m'a donné un esprit d'batard
Pour les fils et darons au shtar j'vous baise (?)

Cotoyer la fille du maire mais je ne suis pas son gendre
Des flows, des phases, des mélodies, poto y'a de quoi en vendre
Le but de l'objectif: niquer tout, vous surprendre
C'est Marin Monster, ne surtout pas confondre
On sort des fonds marins, pour une fois que ce n'est pas de l'ombre
Vendre des CDs et avoir plein de diamants sur ma montre
Le Game me donne la chiasse, j'ai qu'une envie c'est de vous pondre
(?) j'espère que tu pousses la fonte
Bedjik représente la tess', surtout ne nous fait pas honte
Tu fais grave le buzz, on parle de toi partout, te rends-tu compte?
Prends pas la grosse tête, sinon en 2 secondes on te monte
Laisse passer Drancy Nord sinon par la sortie on rentre
Mes rebeus sont pas sympa il t'en faudra peu pour qu'ils t'eventrent

I can hear myself fall, whenever you call my name 
You make me feel like dyin' now 

I never knew how much I longed for 
Someone quite like you 
You're what I've been waitin for all my life; it's true 
So hear me say 

I felt weak in the knees, when you said ""won't you please"" 
Take my hand cause I feel like dancin' 
I could feel my heart pound, overcome by the sound 
Of the music in your romancin' arms

De la fenêtre du salon

Etalé sur la plage
Le reste des marées

Et le baume au coeur éventré
où tu aimais te cacher
Ce baume au éventré
qui garde tes secrets
sur lequel t'a rayé
""amour éternité""
dans lequel tu m'as soufflé:
""les hommes ont le coeur...
en béton armé""

Et le blanc immaculé
de la chaux qui me dévore
et les traces laissées 
qui me rappelle que j'ai eu tort
Une année à cogner
contre ces murs
La façade a cédé je vois mieux maintenant

Je n'ai touché à rien
Je n'ai rien reconstruit
Je vais laissé de l'espace

Allongée dans l'herbe, j'oublie les jours, les semaines
Sans toi, sans un mur autour de moi, je regarde le ciel trouble

Cause 'round me life goes on and on and on and on 
But have one last cry 

One last cry 
Before I leave it all behind 
I've gotta put you out of my mind for the very last time 
Been living a lie 
I guess I'm down I guess I'm down I guess I'm down

Marina Kaye,"Like fire beneath the ice
An inevitable demise
Standing on the edge jumping into hurt
Time and time again I will never learn

And I should cut all the ties
Let it burn and walk away from you
There's beauty in suffering
When you love someone you're scared to lose

I know I'm dancing with the devil
Ain't no chance of heaven
Going straight to hell
I know I'm dancing with the devil
Darken up my heaven
Brighten up my hell

Hear the sirens in the air
Or the warnings signs were there
When I feel and touch it burns my skin
Echoing sublime and spreads within

And I should cut all the ties
Let it burn and walk away from you
This predator I let in knows my heart
There's nothing I can't do

I know I'm dancing with the devil
Ain't no chance of heaven
Going straight to hell
I know I'm dancing with the devil
Darken up my heaven
Brighten up my hell

This passion is a blasphemy
My second lung my enemy

I know I'm dancing with the devil
Darken up my heaven
Brighten up my hell

I oppose my pride my dignity
And this hold you got it smothers me
In my narrow boots on rocky ground
Is where my angels fly

I know I'm dancing with the devil
Ain't no chance of heaven
Going straight to hell
I know I'm dancing with the devil
Darken up my heaven
Brighten up my hell

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Uma Noite E 1/2

O meu louco querer
Não importa com quem você se deite
Que você se deleite seja com quem for
Apenas te peço que aceite

Ah! Mainha deixa o ciúme chegar
Deixa o ciúme passar e sigamos juntos
Ah! Neguinha deixa eu gostar de você
Pra lá do meu coração não me diga
Nunca não

Teu corpo combina com meu jeito
Nós dois fomos feitos muito pra nós dois
Não valem dramáticos efeitos
Mas o que está depois

Não vamos fuçar nossos defeitos
Cravar sobre o peito as unhas do rancor
Lutemos mas só pelo direito
Ao nosso estranho amor

O mundo está na minha mão
Coração, coragem, pra qualquer viagem, pra qualquer sermão
Não deixe as roupas que eu rasguei te encobrirem de razão
Se você pensa que eu não sei

O tanto o quanto eu te ensinei
Pois saiba que só mesmo o amor
Pra te cegar como cegou
O fato é que eu já constatei

Nem tudo é mão ou contramão

E o resto é pura ilusão

E violenta
Você gelou o meu olhar
Era num cruzamento
Fazia tempo,

Te pergunte, I o que que há?
Você me disse apenas:
Fui ao inferno,
Tudo pra não te procurar
Eu me senti num beco
E disse a seco
Como é que não te vi por lá?

Eu já quis morrer
Eu já quis matar
Tudo por alguém
Que não sabe amar
Eu analiso tudo

E me pergunto
Quero a verdade
Ou quero amar?
É beira do abismo,
Queira ou não queira,
Estamos prestes a voar",Prestes a Voar

Eu penso em você
E nos caminhos
Que hão de vir
Sol Estrada aberta pro mar

Só começar
Tarde da noite
Nunca é tarde demais
Pra imaginar
Você aqui
Só
Um beijo pode acalmar
Suas Dúvidas
E a vida

Pode ser feliz
Mesmo por instantes
Mesmo por um triz
Eu quero o sal, o doce, o sempre
Surpresas pelo are
Eu quero azul

Amor que tarde
Mas nunca vá falhar
Ser um rio Infinito
Nascer de novo em seu olhar

Provar o vento
Deitar ao sol
E me apaixonar
E me apaixonar",Sugar

Marina Lima,"Quando a gente conversa
Contando casos, besteiras
Tanta coisa em comum
Deixando escapar, segredos

E eu não sei
Que hora dizer
Me dá um medo
É que eu preciso dizer

Que eu te amo
Te ganhar ou perder
Sem engano
Eu preciso dizer
Que te amo, tanto

E até o tempo passa
Arrastado
Só prá eu ficar
Do teu lado

Você me chora dores
De outro amor
Se abre e acaba comigo
E nessa novela
Eu não quero
Ser seu amigo

É que eu preciso dizer
Que te amo
Te ganhar ou perder
Sem engano
Eu preciso dizer
Que te amo, tanto

Eu já nem sei
Se eu tô me estorando
Eu perco o sono, ¡Uh! ¡Uh!
Lembrando cada gesto teu
Qualquer bandeira
Fechando e abrindo a geladeira
A noite inteira

Eu não sei
Em que hora dizer
Me dá um medo

É que eu preciso dizer
Que te amo
Te ganhar ou perder
Sem engano
Eu preciso dizer
Que te amo tanto, tanto

Marina Rama,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Marina V,"One night in Greece made me feel so complete and divine
Soft summer breeze floated in from the sea whispering you are mine
The wind told lies
'Til the morning light

Over and over I'm falling
Spinning in circles and begging for you
Over and over I'm falling
Slipping with no one to hold me
I'm falling down

Leaves falling down and my grey rainy town seems so dead
Don't know your name yet still I keep on wishing for yesterday
I'd give my life
For just one more night

Each night I dream of the breeze from the sea
And I still feel the touch of your hands
Can I escape from the grey autumn day
And return to the night we once had?",Falling
Marina V,"Cold waves crash on your rocky shore
Shape the stone and smooth the jagged edges
Can't get close enough to be at one with you
Your low tide still keeps me waiting
It's getting hard to see
through your misty breeze

Ocean in a distant harbor
It seems you're getting farther
I'll walk still tomorrow
To my ocean in a distant harbor

Each day it seems the sky sinks deep
Your eyes are grey but never faded
I always dreamed to be at one with you
With open arms I feel you take me

It's so hard to see through your misty breeze

I'll walk the maze for you
It's not my race to lose

Running out of space
Now my life is no vacation
But, I miss the rain

I've been waiting for a phone call
That never came
No surprises, just disguises
Play their faceless game
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes

Find the way, find the way
Maybe I'm afraid, maybe I'm amazed

There's a baby girl
That I know
And she's so fine
I meet her everyday
After school
Walk her to the train
It's been some time
Cause what her papa don't know
Won't hurt me
Mama thinks that 
I'm a cutie
She can't date till her sweet sixteen
But we just tryin' a do our thang

So I meet her at the 2 train

Riding all the way to 110th
I get to hold her hand
Whisper in her ear
The only time I get the time
Is on the 2 train
Is on the 2 train

We always meet in the back car
So no one else can interrupt
So much to talk about
So little time
I wish we didn't have to rush
Cause by 42nd - to have a listen
77nd - Reminiscing
96th Street - Watch start clicking
And I'm about to do my thang

So I meet her at the 2 train

Riding all the way to 110th
I get to hold her hand
Whisper in her ear
The only time I get the time
Is on the 2 train

I can't wait
'Till we don't have to worry 
'Bout what no one
Has to say
'Cause we'll be free
Won't have to sneak around no more
But we're here now
And the future's not so far away
So until that day I'll say

Riding all the way to 110th
I get to hold her hand

Mario,"Girl you wanna know whats up
I can truly say that I love you
And we know that love is not puffed up
So there are things
In love that you'll never do

I would never jump off a building and survive
And if that building were burning up
I'd never leave you inside
I'd probably never live to see a hundred years old
And no matter who's around I'd never
Treat you cold

I will never lie to you baby boo
I will never treat you untrue (no no)
They say never say what you wouldn't do (wouldn't do)
I can say I'll say never, I will never hurt you

So you wanna be, made secure
Never give your heart unless, you were sure
Just wanna know, where I'm at
Me leaving you girl, never that
I can never fight, a hundred men and win
And I've never known the beauty of a girl, in a friend
They say never say, what you wouldn't do
But they never been in love with a girl like you

I will never lie to you baby boo
I will never treat you untrue ( no no no no no no)
They say never say never (They say never)

so we took her to the back and started freaking in the party
Then i, threw her legs up, flipped her waist up,

Oh you should've shown me a little more love

For me to walk out on this thing called ""us""

I know you gonna act a fool but I gotta let her know

In between that week we split up (cause you need to know) 
It was lookin' so good I couldn't say no 
(I think it's time you know) 
Every time I see you wit her (ooh)

It's a shame when a man just can't say no 
Oh, yeah 

Now see what is done is done 
And I realize now ain't no takin' it back 
I committed the worst crime I could ever do to my girl

Mario,"It's kinda crazy baby,
How I remember things (like where you came from and how you had nothin)
I went and made you fly,
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine)

You made it clear to me (you wasn't down for me),
(I may be blind baby) but now I see,
(You had things up your sleeve, don't even lie to me)
I even heard it from your family,

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I thought you?
How could you put him up to the ghetto kama sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

You must be out your mind,
You got a lot of nerve
(To think that I'm gon chill after all that shit I heard),
I damn near carried you,
I could've married you,
Good thing I found out before I bought that seven carat for you,
(I know you're sick about) the way I found you out,
(Go ahead and pack it out)
I hope he got romance in his house,
You should have thought of me before you hopped in the sheets,
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I thought you?
How could you put him up to the ghetto kama sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

Girl I tried to give you everything,
Can't believe the ways you repaid me,
Girl you had it all,
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you,
Baby I've accepted it,
And I ain't goin' trip,
Girl I'm movin' on,
Sometimes I give up and think that another man's gonna get the one that's in for me

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I thought you?
How could you put him up to the ghetto kama sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

How could you how could you just go and lay there,
How could you how could just give him everything,
How could you how could you call him names like that,

When she just happened to wave
That's when I knew she had the right shine (right shine)

Mario,"[Verse 1]
What have I missed,
Living like this?
Who'd think I'd get this far,
Fancy house and my fancy car
Why you living like this?
Together as kids,
You were my best of friend,
All the trouble you got up in

[Bridge]
See I been deaf, and I been scared,
I been discriminated against and compared,
To you whose my brother, thanks to you I discovered
There's only one way to go in life and that's be right

[Chorus]
There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
See me, I ain't always done right, right, right, right,
That's why I'm here to help you fight, fight, to do right

[Verse 2]
You were the queen in my future,
I was the one you was used to,
It was like we were one,
Up under the sun
And narcotics in your system,
The love I should have unlisted,
Now look what we've become,
But I shouldn't judge

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cause in life there are decisions to make but it's your choice,
But I chose to walk away, rather than wildin' out, and get locked away
See my friends all chose the fast money, but I chose my father
Cause I knew he'd come for me and recover me, already dead
See what I'm trying to say, is I'm trying to be the best man I can be
And when I see you too, struggling to do the best you can do
You may run into a rock, but you can't let it stop what's planned for you,
So make the right choice

[Chorus x2]",Do Right
Mario,"You know what
You know what

You're that everyday girl, a face like a magazine
Ya ass I wanna hold, every ghetto nigga'z fantasy, yeah, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Hey, I think I really wanna be your lover
Not the one you wake up to
A nigga call and touch ya, don't wanna fuck you like no other
I'm not tryna range rov truck ya, or diamond clutch ya
Ain't really tryna meet yo mother, just wanna fuck you like no other

[Chorus]
Let's go, c'mon (go), come and get it (go), c'mon (go)
Come and get it (go), c'mon (go), come and get it (go), you know what [2x]

If it's good girl, why wouldn't I come back again
Little boys mess it up for me, and that I don't understand
When ya mouth's in ya hand yeah

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

How'd you like it,
And the way that you smile I can tell that you told your girlfriend
The way you showed up if I start fuckin' you it'll make ya world end yeah
Would it be a smile or a frown if I brought your girl in
Why you smirkin' yeah

[Bridge]

Those other guys go wrong with you (you,you)
They sell you dreams that they can't keep
They send you lies disguised as the truth (tru, truth)
They say the skies are green, that I've never seen
While I just say that it's blue (blue, blue)
You get the sun to me, bout you can't see
And I'll just say you are cute
I'll keep it short and clean
For that ass I'm a fiend yeah

Mario,"I'm trying to save us girl...
They got that...
They got that kryptonite...

[Verse 1:]
It seems the more I try to do right,
The more I lie about being at sessions and leaving at certain times,
She's like, ""Where you at?""
I'm at the studio at home,
and I'm thinking to myself we cut that record days ago
Cause shorty on the east side, hit me and want to know if I could stop by,
Now I'm contemplating what I am gonna say, bout this being the umpteenth time that I'm late

[Chorus:]
I wanna be your superman,
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can,
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
These girls got kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
And I really wanna make it work, but I cant stop messing round,
I keep doing dirt,
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
These girls got kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
Oh baby

[Verse 2:]
It's like the more I brush them off, the more they call,
The more I want to tell them that I'm not involved,
With anyone, when I know it's you,
Wanna tell the truth but it's just so hard to do,
Caught up in me again it's driving me crazy
It's the reason I won't tell em i got a lady,
Now I'm trying to contemplate on what I am gonna say, on this being the umpteenth time that I'm late

[Bridge:]
No matter what I do, I know that your my true love,
But I just cant help it to get caught up with all these broads,
Sittin' here with this mic in my hand,
Trying to make all the words to make my baby understand

[Chorus:]

oooh yeah yeah

[Verse 3:]
I want you to be my Louis Lane,
Girl I promise I'm gonna change, and it ain't gonna be this way forever,
Girl I'm gonna get myself together, cause your the one I love,
Because your like a drug that I can't get enough of,
I'm just so confused, don't know what to do,
Cause the way that it's feeling, I like how it's feeling,
It's getting so hard, to fight that feeling

[Rap: Rich Boy]
I'm a rich boy riding in my big superstar shit,
The one girls try to get they text me on my sidekick
Bring em to my palace, tell em take it off we make a flick,
Every night I do it so at least one chick I gotta get
Just like kryptonite them girls make me super weak,
Suck my dick and play with me until they put me straight to sleep,
Twenty girls on my sheets, seven days out the week,
It's hard trying to hold it down with groupies trying to get with me,
I stay dreaming, fantasizing, with my eyes closed,
I love you girl but I'm addicted to them hoes
If ballin' is a sin then God please forgive me,
My women so bad and my money so filthy really

[Chorus: x2]",Kryptonite

Watch the bubbles overlap while I pour one in the glass
I came here to watch you, baby, to watch you
Don't be afraid of the couch cause, baby, I got you

Better yet, go and get up, I ain't gon' tell you again
Why don't you stand over me and let me see what it is
And maybe my tastin' with your rotation
Will show you why I couldn't wait to get to the crib

Damn you feel so good to me
I figured I should just take some time
And only do what a man needs to do
When a man there to keep his woman pleased

Wanna make sure that you come again
Wanna be the one you call again
To fulfill all your needs

Go on and put your hands around it
Damn, you put your hands around it

Do that lil' thing around it
Don't you dare try to leave without this
Just keep doin' what you're doin'

You could take as much time as you want, take it out
Trust me, I won't hit that and be gone
Just fulfill all your needs

From her head to her clothes, how she throw it on
But I'm tryin' to see her take it off
It's like football, I plan on goin' long, hut hut

I plan on goin' deep
You the ground, I'm the casket, I'm goin' six feet
Yeah, baby, I'm a fully loaded freak
One in the head, don't make me bust off my piece

Them other dudes soft like sheets
Me, I'm tryin' to get you on my sheets
Tobago shorts say 'pink'
Oh, those Victoria's Secrets

And I know how to keep a secret
So I won't tell nobody what we did
No but we could chill and pop Heavy bottles
We can ride in the Phantom while the Bentley follows

Not the way I planned it
Why can't it just be what it is?

So tell me why are you still here

Every night that I come home and your laying in bed
(All I wanna do is make love to you)
But now I got reservations
Because you actin' strange

All that shit ain't cool)
You say you got my number (Number)
That I've been caught, admit it (Admit it)
Say I'm playing dumb, but (Dumb but)

And you should know by now (Now)
That I was all for you

With Me, Oh oh

[Verse 3]
You got so used to the fast life
All of the things I could do for you
Catch you coming back to me (yeah)
Always running back to me

Polow the Don, listen girl
Mario, let's go, ladies

It?s like you caught up in a maze
You keep on going in circles, girl
You're trying to find your way out
But it's time I put on my cape and
Put that S on my chest
Girl I wanna come and save you

But I'm stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him and you wanna make it work
And I can't help but think that I known you first
It?s getting louder, girl, can't ignore it no more

I can hear your heart crying out for me
(Crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me
(And it keeps on saying)

Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me
(And it keeps on saying)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me
(I can baby)
I can hear your heart crying out for me

Baby, I should've never caught no feeling
But baby having late night conversions on your sofa
You telling me how he played you out
Over and over, over and over

But I'm stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him and you wanna make it work
And I can't help but think that I knew you first
It?s getting louder, girl, I can't ignore it no more baby

I can hear your heart crying out for me
(Crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me

Girl, it?s crying, it?s crying

I don't wanna confuse things
(No)
But I just can't keep lying to myself
When you're holding me
(When you're holding me)

I can feel your pain
Oh baby, let me be your dream
I'm the answer come see me
(See me)
And you don't have to cry no more

Girl, I can hear your heart
I can hear your heart, girl, it?s crying
Won't you listen to your heart, baby?

I can hear your heart crying out for me
(Girl, it?s crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me

Mario,"How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Feels so different being here
I'm so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
There's no one to talk to

Don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over is so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

I just had a wake up call
Should have never let you fall
Baby, you were not the blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away

Baby if you knew I care
You wouldn't have never went nowhere
Girl I should have been right there

How do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?

When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Girl I'm losing my mind
Yes I've made a mistake
Thought that you would be mine
Guess the joke was on me

Miss you so bad I can't sleep
I wish I knew where you could be
Another dude is replacing me
God this can't be happening

I just had a wake up call
Should have never let you fall
Baby, you were not the blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away

Baby if you knew I care
You wouldn't have never went nowhere (nowhere)
Girl I should have been right there

And now I wonder

How do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?

When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me (I say)
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

I should’ve brought my love home, girl
And baby I ain’t perfect, you know
The grind has got a tight hold,
girl, come back to me
‘Cause girl you made it hard to breathe
when you’re not with me

Tell me, how do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?
When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me
How do I breathe?

Mario,"We've had such a great time
In these past two months
I never laughed so much
In my life

It's been all about us
Since that time we had
That intimate talk
Suddenly your actin' strange

Plus your conversation
Just upped and changed
Is it because your afraid
What you feelin' for me

Is the beginning of a
New heart break?
Hear me when I say

You ain't gotta
Give me your love
You ain't gotta
Say I'm your one

You ain't gotta
Tell me where you be
'Cause you ain't
Obligated to me

I'm not sayin' that
You should just
Rush and give me
Your heart

I'm just askin' that you
Like me real hard
Just like me real hard

You know just like I know
We've been broken by love
And we both need time to heal
That's why

In this short amount of time
We've grown so close
'Cause you relate to
Everything I feel

So let's not complicate things
By placing titles on you and I
But what we can do
Before we make the next move

We gotta find the perfect
Reason why
So believe me when I say

You ain't gotta
Give me your love
You ain't gotta
Say I'm your one

You ain't gotta
Tell me where you be
'Cause you ain't
Obligated to me

I'm not sayin' that
You should just
Rush and give me
Your heart

I'm just askin' that you
Like me real hard
Just like me real hard

You ain't ready
To fall in love
And I ain't ready to
Care so much

We ain't ready for commitment
Right now
But together we can
Work something out

When the time is right
'Cause we will feel it in our hearts
It will be written in the stars
But for now
Just like me real hard

You ain't gotta
Give me your love
You ain't gotta
Say I'm your one

You ain't gotta
Tell me where you be
'Cause you ain't

There were too many goodbyes,
And I can't say I was so innocent,
Cause I told my share of lies,
But it seems like whenever I get close to her,
Love would just be away,
But just when I thought my chances were over,
I stared my future in the face.

I looked at main girl in the eye,
And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)
Hi(hi) hi(hi) hi(hi)
And I knew it before she said hi

I made a lot of broken promises,
I had no respect for words,
And I thought I got all that I'm against,
Until I ran into her,
She whispers to me and it pulls me closer,
Now I can't stay away,
And now I feel like all my pain is over,
I stared my future in the face.

And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)

I had a feeling before she said hi,
And she told him bye,

Fallen star from the sky,
Fell in love the first look at her eyes,
?
Doing her wrong she keep doing her own,
Now I'm taking her home little goose and patron,
Let's get it on,
Turn off your phone let's get blown,
In the zone?

Forget about the cash life no longer painful,
Look what we came to

I done changed boo and for that I wanna thank you,

How could you lead me on 
And not let me stay around  
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone 
What used to be right is wrong 
Can love that's lost be found ? 
For awhile, to love each other with all 
We would ever need 
Love was strong for so long 
Never knew that what was 
Wrong, oh, baby, wasn't right 
We tried to find what we had 
Till sadness was all we shared 
We were scared 
This affair would lead our love into 
Something happened along the way 
Yesterday was all we had 
Something happened along the way 
What used to be happy is sad 
Something happened along the way 
Yesterday was all we had 
And, oh, after the love has gone 
How could you lead me on 
And not let me stay around ? 
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone 
What used to be right is wrong 
Can love that's lost be found ?

Let your heart be light 
From now on, 
Our troubles will be out of sight 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, 
Make the Yule-tide gay, 
From now on,

Happy golden days of yore.

Gather near to us once more.

Can reach across forever
A long weekend, my mother's friend
You came in search of weather

The women I saw, I'd seen years before
But never like this
Your kiss on my cheek, said
""Find if you seek a moment of bliss""

I'll never forget you, don't ever regret you
You opened my eyes
Wherever I go in this world, as I stumble on shifting sand
You were there, when a boy turned man

Secretly it had to be
Though honest was our passion
And every moment in your arms
Made mockery of fashion

And after the glow
The talk of the soul
Will stay deep inside

I'll never forget you, I'll always respect you
You opened my eyes
Whatever I do in this life
As I battle against the tide

I'll never forget you, I'll always respect you
You opened my eyes
Wherever I go in this world, as I stumble on shifting sand

But I love you until the end of time

Come what may, come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you

And there's no mountain too high, no river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather and stars may collide

Mario Frangoulis,"Every little tear you cry
Leaves your heart so heavy
Every time you hear goodbye
You wonder will it ever end

There's nothing I can tell you
The world moves on and on
But I still believe in love

Follow your heart
Wherever it takes you
Nobody knows
Where the wind blows
No one can say

Follow your dreams
Wherever they find you
Lost and alone, the light in the storm
Will always be with you
If you follow your heart

When the world's a little crazy
The truth's so hard to find
But I still believe in love

Follow your heart
Wherever it takes you
Nobody knows
Where the wind blows
No one can say

Follow your dreams
Wherever they find you
Lovers and friends, they fade in the end
But the love that's inside you
Grows stronger inside you

Will always be with you
Follow your heart

Mario Frangoulis,"Cuanta tierra he recorrido
Why cuanto he vista ya
Aeropuertos why estaciones why gente de ciudad
Que se marchaba de prisa cada cual con su destino
Why detrás de las miradas
Un pensamiento...

Hay más, mucho más
Why no sé donde encontrario
Hay más, mucho más
De esta monotonía

¿Por donde nace la locura?
¿Por qué existe el amor?
Why además de su apariencia
¿Qué es la vida?

Al otro lado de ti, de lo que ves
Del rojo del atardecer
Del mar why de la lluvia
Hay mucho más por saber
Why lo sabrás, si cada dia que vendrá
Lo dejarás crecer en ti

Hay más, mucho más
De todo lo que te enseñan
Hay más, mucho más
Por ti mismo descubrirás

¿Por qué la piedad se rinde frente a un ideal?
¿Por qué tantos pensamientos, cuando se podría hablar?
Cuanta fuerza necesita, tu te preguntarás
Si te bastará una vida para aprender que

Al otro lado de ti, de lo que ves
Del rojo del atradecer
Del sol why del viento
Hay mucho más por saber
Why lo sabrás, si cada día que vendrá
Lo dejarà crecer en ti

de todo lo que te enseñan

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

Mario Lanza,"The magic of springtime is around us tonight
Enchantment is borne on the breeze
And clothes in the silver of tender moonlight
The birds murmur soft in the trees

As deep in the shadow your eyes look in mine
Within them a soft flame gently glows
The breath of the night wind is filled with the scent of the rose
Oh, love while I live, I will always enshrine
Your love in the heart of a rose

Deep in my heart, dear
I have a dream of you
Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever
Deep in my heart, dear
I'll always dream of you

I've waited a lifetime for someone to say
The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see
You smile and my tears have all melted away
My worries were all false and naught

It looks like the start of a beautiful day
Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day
As long as I'm here in your arms

Deep in my heart, dear
I have a dream of you
Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever
Deep in my heart, dear
I'll always dream of you

Mario Lanza,"Do you wonder why I love you so
If you really want to know
Ask the rose why it is blossoming
Ask the sun what makes it glow

Ask the mountain why the river flows
Down to meet the distant sea
Do you wonder why I love you so
It's because it has to be 

Do you wonder why a star glows 
When you look up at the sky
Why it rains and why the wind blows
Do you wonder so do I

Do you wonder why I sing to you
Of a love that must be told 
It's because my heart is filled with joy
More than one poor heart hold 

Ask the angels in the sky above
Why they sent you down to me
Do you wonder why I love you so

Golden days, full of gaiety and full of truth
In our hearts we remember them all else above

We will know life has nothing sweeter than its springtime

Mario Lanza,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday romantic and gay.",Granada

I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me

And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear and it's applause
Because you're mine, because you're mine

Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down

And she sees the road by the poplars,
Where they met in the bygone years,
For the first little song of the roses,
Is the last little song she hears:
 
Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,
But there's never a rose like you!
And the roses will die with the summertime,
And our roads may be far apart,
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy,
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart",Roses of Picardy [#]
Mario Lanza,"Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, The Continental,
A way of dancing that's really 'entre nous'.
It's very subtle, The Continental,
Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.
It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.
Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.
You kiss while you're dancing.

The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.
You will find while you're dancing
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul,
A certain rhythm that you can't control,
And you will do 
The Continental all the time.",The Continental
Mario Lanza,"Listen to my tale of woe,

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me

Within them a soft flame gently glows
The breath of the night wind is filled with the scent of the rose
Oh, love while I live, I will always enshrine
Your love in the heart of a rose

Deep in my heart, dear
I have a dream of you
Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever
Deep in my heart, dear
I'll always dream of you

I've waited a lifetime for someone to say
The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see
You smile and my tears have all melted away
My worries were all false and naught

It looks like the start of a beautiful day
Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day
As long as I'm here in your arms

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play

Till you whisper to me once more,

Mario Lanza,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

And love has come, at last I know

Take the place of sand and skies

In one Woman's smile

One alone, to be my own
I alone, to know her caresses
One to be, eternally

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll be looking at the moon

When ever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between

Across the years
Will come to me
Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie
Just an echo of a sigh
Goodbye

All my life I shall remember knowing you
All the pleasure I have found in showing you
The different ways
That one may phrase
The changing light
And changing shade
Happiness that must die
Melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade
Dusty and forgotten by and by

I'll see you again
When ever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between
But what has been
is past forgetting
This sweet memory
Across the years

Though my world may go awry

Be my love
For no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms
The way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire
With every sweet desire

Be my love
And with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand
We'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you for me

The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you

Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

And let my arms in yours entwine.

Mario Lanza,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!",O Little Town of Bethlehem

Colinette with the sea-blue eyes,
She is watching and longing, and waiting
Where the long white roadway lies,
And a song stirs in the silence,
As the wind in the boughs above,
She listens and starts and trembles,
'Tis the first little song of love.
 
Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,
But there's never a rose like you!
And the roses will die with the summertime,
And our roads may be far apart,
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy,
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart
 
And the years fly on forever,
Till the shadows veil their skies,
But he loves to hold her little hands,
And look into her sea-blue eyes,
And she sees the road by the poplars,
Where they met in the bygone years,
For the first little song of the roses,
Is the last little song she hears:
 
Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.

Sure plays a mean pinball!

Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,

Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé mi vida dejé mi amor 
Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé enterrado mi corazón 

Una triste tormenta 
Te está azotando sin descansar 
Pero el sol de tus hijos 
Pronto la calma te hará alcanzar 

Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé mi vida dejé mi amor 
Cuando salí de Cuba 
Dejé enterrado mi corazón",Cuando Sali de Cuba
Mario Peralta,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings",Volare
Mario Pezzotta,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Mario Pezzotta,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

Mario Pezzotta,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""

Mario Pezzotta,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue
Mario Pezzotta,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere

Mario Pezzotta,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Three times this same week you been askin' to come to my crib 
Girl you got a problem and I know what it is 
You done got a little taste of incredible that's got you out of pocketing and you don't know why 
And it should come as know surprise 
That I got something that blows your mind 

I think it's the way that I move 
The things that I do 
That's a little different 
From the things that you did 
When your not here 
And that's why your trippin'

I bet he don't give you whatcha need 
I bet he don't give you watchu want 
Said I bet, said I bet he don't do it like me 
That's why you always trying to be alone 
I bet he don't kiss ya right 
Don't miss you right 
Don't handle his like I handle mine 
I bet he can't do it like me 
No, no, no, no baby 

So don't try to fight it 
You can't hide it from me, no 
What I said, tried to fix 
Everyday, you a hit 
You can't let it go 'cause your love is so 
Now you say your not sprung and any day you'll be through 
That's why I got 
Five missed calls on my phone 
And they all come from you 

I think it's the way that I move 
The things that I do 
And that's a little different 
From the things that you did 
When your not here 
And that's why your trippin' 
I bet he can't

Let me say one thing 
I know to be true 
That he don't understand your body 
Quite like I do 
And the feeling that you get is so ridiculous 
It's hard to quit 
Oh, I betcha he

And outta this place""

As soon as I pulled up pure hate in his eyes

He looked at me and said ""Hey, you better stay away""

Listen to this, girl if you give me one shot
I will love you forever now
No one will do you better now
Love is a risk but if you give me one shot,
I will show you you're the only girl in the world who can give me this feeling

Just like you want it
Anything you need you can call me for it

Now girl I'm only human, I'm full of many faults
I'm guaranteed to fall short
But you'll never hear about me cheating 'cause I never would betray your trust no matter what
I will look to you and only you for love
I treat your soul like it was mine
What a privilege to me to be breathe you're air
Doesn't that say that I care

Venuti male
La tangenziale
La ferrovia
Le notti insonni
Girando in auto
Per la sacra periferia
Storie di Corviale
Di Quarto Oggiaro
Di Scampia
Di Librino e Zen
Sono conficcate come pugnali
Nel ventre della città

Tu mi hai raccontato
Che rubavi rame
Che ti ha beccato la polizia
Che sei già sposato
Con una bambina
Con la cocaina
Vivi a casa sua
Ti giuro amore
Non la tocco più
La polverina che dicevi tu
A volume alto
Dalle autoradio
Nel ventre della città

Ci incontreremo le sere d'estate
Sul mare d'asfalto di queste borgate
Non sarà male fermarsi a guardare
Le nostre ferite
Le stelle inventate

C'è chi dorme male
Sogna di scappare
Dai discreti letti della borghesia
C'è chi non la legge
Solo dentro i libri
La cerca altrove la poesia
Meglio l'animale
Che ti mostra il cuore
Nella comunione
Di una botta e via
Tu lo puoi trovare
Dove Cristo muore
Nel ventre della città

Ci incontreremo le sere d'estate
Sul mare d'asfalto di queste borgate
Non sarà male fermarsi a guardare

And let me down baby

Made it cleared, that you don't care

Should've left it alone after waitin' so long 
What are you doin' to me baby? 
I don't want to receive what your tellin' to me

What makes you think I can't make it?
Put me to the test, I'll take it
I've been through more trials
But I've overcome all of them
And I've never been one for faking
I kept on moving and shaking
And that's how I made it

I've seen it all
But I never let no one
Tell me it's right, when it's wrong
Cause I heard it all before
And it gives me a reason to fight for
A right for, to do what I gotta do

All of my life
I was told that you had to go through
Just to get where you want
And if you come across a storm
You just gotta keep holding on, and stay strong
And do what you gotta do

Hey yo I came from the bottom, worked my way up
Ran wit big dudes, had to get my weight up
Now my cake up, now it's lights, cameras, make up
Trips to Jacob, foreign countries
Reminisce of times when we all was hungry
Now I made it, and all y'all niggaz can hate it
Seeing that I sound like Mase and
Knowing that I came from the basement
Did my own thing, so face it
Now they coming wit cases, now wit this hand I'm racist
I'm so close I can taste it
Sometimes I just wanna grab toast and take it

Crack! I mixed the Black with Phillipino
Used to live in Reno but we met on the beach
Sang bars from the star, everythang was peace
Then we got our shit together, you moved in the castle
Let you shop wit the Capital One, no hassles
One minute you're cool, next minute you're amped
Talking loud trying to play me like a wet food stamp
Ho!! Think of me in your life with the next dude
I'm like Chef, I'm contemplating my next move
Then think of all the wankstas I hit
Ain't this a bitch? shit this is all the thanks I get?

That you can walk away, from my love

You could never put a price on us

Mario Winans,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin' about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin' you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin' the grief
Baby moms starts sexin', my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin' your breathin', long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin'
Pain

I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin' chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin' I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin' my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away

I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin'
On my knees cryin' and prayin', then I said
""God why?  Got to know how hard we try
Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening three
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenuous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

I'm tellin' you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck who it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin' your name out
Like they screamin' all these other, so-called hot niggas
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain",The Pain

And she can not handle
The pain of this world
I wonder when she'll move on
and I wonder if she'll just run
Leaving family men, violent men
She's running from men, running
I didn't want to get in a fight
But it's already on your roster tonight
I'm clinging on to your clothes
And to feel your leather and to smell your leather
The feeling of power is yours not mine
I've seen this happen a million times
Why don't you stop when you see me cry
Can you carry on with tears in my eyes
Left behind
On the floor
And I really want to stay here
From the sight that I just saw
I didn't really see you at all
Because the girl in front of me was myself when I was small
And now she's running from men, run, run
I didn't want to get in a fight
But it's already on your roster tonight
I'm clinging on to your clothes
have to feel your leather and to smell your leather
The feeling of power is yours not mine
I've seen this happen a billion times
And all your hands just cheer
When I'm as white as a sheet with fear

Marion,"You're sitting in a smokey room

Not that there's anyone that you would know anyway
You can't say those last words
Alone but so strong
But tell me how long can you go on with just songs
Tomorrow when we realise
Why the gift of our eyes
What am I feeling and who am I missing
As the same head storm goes on
While the thick grey clouds follow your life down
You're not in the frame of mind
It's easier going down
It's you, yourself are the only one who could take it away

You're stopped doing what you do
Waiting to come down so you can go out
You decide to get going out

And your mind's made up, you're going to get out
You can't say those last words
Alone but so strong
But tell me how long is it gonna go on
Tomorrow when we arise
Wipe the venom from your eyes
What am I feeling and who am I missing
As the same head storm goes out
And thick grey clouds follow your life down

And it's easier going down

Stuck at the same point
All you do is sulk

As she gazed up at the sun
Said she knows of an alternative way

With our miles stretched out behind her
Now she's looking at me

And not doing enough, your head is too full
Your making me uneasy
'cause I have to think stirring it up""

Even though I
Know everything I need to know about you

And you do too
I watch you searching for gain for yourself

Turns it's ugly head and looks at you
There's some things that you just have to see
Follow me

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Marion Harris,"I'm nobody's baby
I wonder why
Each night and day I pray the Lord up above
Please send me down somebody to love

But nobody wants me
I'm blue somehow
Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me
Because I'm nobody's baby now

Nobody's baby
And I've got to know the reason why
Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said
""Hey! Maybe I was meant for you""
But he only shook his head and said ""Goodbye""
He kept on walking down the avenue

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon

Sometimes it's all a big surprise

But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

Walking uptown
With the rain in the snow
When I saw you
It came without a warning
A face I had never seen
A feeling I had never known

Moving slow in the early morning
Making love in the quiet of the day
The world was waiting to take us to a new place
We knew that we were changing
We knew that we would never be the same

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
You'll be there at the end of the day

Two years later we are living together
We built our dream house on a hill by the sea
We could see the shadows that were growing in the distance
We were hiding
We were blind to what we did not want to see

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
We will be together

5 years gone by, we have turned into strangers
We never talk since you went away
Now I find myself walking in circles
I keep looking for you everywhere
Keep waiting for the end of the day

I know
I would do it all again
At the end of the day
When I'm all alone
I get a feeling that I can't explain
If I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't change a thing, if I could somehow
I would do it all over
Over and over again
I hope and I pray
We can do it all over again

We will be together someday

We will be together

The salt of my skin reminds me
The touch of your lips
And I know that you and I will always be

Won't you meet me where?

Won't you meet me here?

Won't you meet me where?

Wake me up before I change my mind
Take my hand before I'm out of time
I know what you want from me
It's all over your face
You've become my enemy
In 13 days
13 days

13, 13, 13 days
13, 13, 13 days

Time is taking way too long
You're still here, I'm so alone
13 days since you came by
I'm your prisoner in the night

Here in your arms
I'm lost at sea
My nightmare is your dream

Marion Raven,"There's a taste in my mouth that I never had before
To be a cheater, defeater, are things I won't ignore
Like a rat in a trap your head got in the way
Nothing left of you but a memory of a bad lay

[Chorus]
Heads gonna roll (heads gonna roll)
I'm back in control (back in control)
It's a jungle out there it's gonna eat you up and strip you bare
I'll swallow you whole (swallow you whole)
Then spit out your soul (spit out your soul)
I want to make this clear, my dear that heads will roll

There's a look in your eyes, am I the one you dread?
You make me wonder what's going on inside your head (inside your head)
You lie and you slither like a cold-blooded snake
I'll make you pay for your big mistake

[Chorus]

When I think of you, I think of this
And then it turns to bitterness
I'm praying for amnesia, I beg for anesthesia

Forget the lies, and numb the pain
If this don't stop I'll go insane
The more I hurt, the more I'll curse your name

[Chorus]",Heads Will Roll
Marion Raven,"You got everything that I want
You got him in the palm of your hand
But I know you've slept with everyone in his band
Again again again

You try to pretend we get along
But pretty little girl, you got it all wrong
I've got my eyes on you and I know what's going
On and on the fights begun

I'm not blind you see
And you're not fooling me
You've stepped into my territory
Let me introduce myself
Your enemy

He would be shocked if he knew what I found out
The canzonet that you play would get a different sound
You lied about your BC to keep him around
Around around around we go

I'm not blind you see
And you're not fooling me
You've stepped into my territory
Let me introduce myself
Your reality

Oh no what have you
Gotten yourself into?

I don't give a shit about you

Mariona Font,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17

Sonhando acordada
O pai leva ao doutor
A filha adoentada
Não come nem estuda
Não dorme nem quer nada

Ela só quer
Só pensa em namorar
Ela só quer
Só pensa em namorar
Ela só quer
Só pensa em namorar

Mas o doutor nem examina
Chamando o pai do lado
Lhe diz logo em surdina
Que o mal é da idade
E que pra tal menina
Não há um só remédio
Em toda medicina

Ela só quer
Ela só pensa em namorar

Ela só quer
Só pensa em namorar",O Xote das Meninas

Marisa Monte,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Chocolate/É Probido Fumar [DVD]

Você não está por perto
E ainda está tão perto

Dentro da gaveta, dentro da garagem e no porão
Em todos os armários, nos vestidos, nos remédios, num botão
Por dentro das paredes, pelos quartos, pelos prédios e no portão
Até no que eu não enxergo
Até mesmo quando eu não quero
Eu não quero
Dentro da camisa, no sapato, no cigarro
Na revista, na piscina, na janela, no carro ao lado
No som do rádio eu ouço a mesma coisa
O tempo inteiro, em fevereiro, em janeiro, em dezembro
Ao meu redor está deserto

Tinha suspirado,    tinha beijado o papel devotamente!

Era a primeira vez que lhe escreviam aquelas sentimentalidades,

E o seu orgulho dilatava-se ao calor amoroso que saí­a delas,

Como um corpo ressequido que se estira num banho tépido;
Sentía um acréscimo de estima por si mesma,

E parecia-lhe que entrava enfim numa existência superiormente interessante,

Onde cada hora tinha o seu encanto diferente,
Cada passo conduzia a um êxtase,

E a alma se cobria de um luxo radioso de sensações!""

Juntar as rimas como um pobre popular
Subir na vida com você em meu altar

Os automóveis que me cercam
Os santos que me projetam
Nas asas do bem desse mundo

Mas nefasto negativo 
Mas estúpido y desleal 
Que mi amor en el olvido

Que lo que doy es real 
Que así es mi forma de amar 
Que así es mi estilo

Que te quiera y que me quieras

Marisela,"Revolviendo en el baúl de los recuerdos
Una foto de los dos ahí encontré
Y después que la mire cerré mis ojos
Y lo nuestro en el pasado recordé
Un amor que fue tan grande y tan bonito
Un adiós por esas cosas del querer
Una lágrima que rodó por mi mejilla
Eran ganas de volverte a ver

Ay baúl de los recuerdos
Como duele estar sin el
Pasa el tiempo y no lo olvido
Como lo pude perder

Ay baúl de los recuerdos
Como sufre el corazón
Pasa el tiempo y sigo siendo
Prisionera de su amor

Hoy sentí tanta tristeza al recordarte
Me di cuenta en realidad cuanto te ame
Y el retrato donde estamos lado a lado
En el fondo del baúl yo lo guarde
Porque se que en este amor
Ya no hay regreso
Porque se que ya no hay nada mas que hacer

Una lágrima rodó por mi mejilla
Eran ganas de volverte a ver

Ay baúl de los recuerdos
Como duele estar sin el
Pasa el tiempo y no lo olvido
Como lo pude perder

Que evitaba entregarme al amor por miedo al fracaso
Para que hacerme falsas promesas sabiendo que no las podías cumplir
Para que fui a creer en tus labios si de nuevo me toca sufrir

No me lastima solamente tu desprecio
Ni esta herida que has abierto aquí en mi pecho
Lo que me duele es haber sido tan ingenua
Por que de nuevo yo y mi alma esta desierta

No me lastima que te vallas y me dejes
Si al fin y al cabo me ha pasado tantas veces
La culpa es mía por creer tan ciegamente
En un amor que no ha sabido merecerme

De que vale gastarnos el tiempo buscando reproches
Y tampoco hace falta que pidas que yo te perdone
Fue mi error el crear la esperanza de que tu serias la oportunidad
De mostrarme  mi misma que puedo encontrar un amor de verdad

No es tuyo por completo

Como puedes comprender que
Estando alado de él
Hay un futuro incierto 
Deshojando madrugadas 
Conteniendo los deseos
Esperando su llegada 
Aunque sea por un momento

No hay nada que duela más
Que tener que aceptar 
Cuando tú eres la otra
Aprender a conformarte
Con las sobras 

No ser mas que la mitad
Del espacio que ocupan en tu vida
Este amor que regresa y se va

No hay nada que duela más 
Que tener que ignorar

Simplemente una mentira

Y dejarlo de hacerlo es justo
Lo que no se vale
Lo que no se debe
Es tener la sangre fría

It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabelle Lee
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me

I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabelle Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me
And this was the reason that, long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabelle Lee
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea

It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabelle Lee

Marissa Nadler,"Mr. John Lee knew about your family 
You came when I was lonesome 
In the fairest of the spring 
But I did not care for your wedding ring 
But I did care for Marie 

Farewell, my sweet 
Bowled you off and took me 
How my hair was a raven 
And my eyes were shining bright 
But I did not love you quite as well 
As your darling loving wife 

But every time that you see 
Your Velveteen Rose 
Then think of how you once called me 
Your Velveteen Rose 

Mr. John Lee 
'Twas an act that you told me 
The burning thoughts you harbored me 
The sheriff found your sweet Marie 
Floating by the river weeds 
In the fields of green 

But every time that you see 
Your Velveteen Rose 
Then think of how you once called me 
Your Velveteen Rose",Mr. John Lee (Velveteen Rose)
Marissa Nadler,"Sooner or later
I will see you or something
We talked in the night
To the sound of the broken swing
In the beginning
Stars I would fancy
And we'd rock in the night
To the sound of the surf crashing

Further and further
Are you growing now
Further and further
Is the spark
Further and further
Are you growing now
Further and further
My little lark

Ode, to my sweet one
In the days of the long run
In the fall looking among
The fields of green and blue
Where did you fly to
Little blue

Sooner or later
I'll be seeing you
In all the markings on the wall
Sooner or later
Will you come to me
Incarnate in the body of a willow tree",My Little Lark

La da da da da da da da di
Old love haunts in the evening
And the remnants of pictures come alive

I told you that I loved you
By the lake with the summer done
Come all your careless wanderers
By the lake with the days of rum

When I first saw you in the sunshine
With the speckles and flaxen in your eyes
When I first saw you in the moonlight
It is true that I thought that I might die

Don't you die 
Oh Mary 
Don't you die

Grey the shades of all nights past me

And your face engraved into the glass of me

And I wrote you every night alone

Letters on the line

come here now
You know I won't desert you
It's been four years of
Waiting for the day
That you would leave your
Girl and take me somewhere away

summertime was lost
And I knew it on the spot
I would marry you some sunny day
But baby I know its strange
To end up this way
A mistress on a sunny day

1000 bottles of why
And the days of rum
Turn to years of swine

I'm leaving you for good this time
Dreams and scars and letters on the line

Marissa Nadler,"I was your lover

And I am an elf

Take me back to the river of dirt

Built of the veins
And the flesh, and the bones
We are all so
Painfully alone

Burning by rivers
Of dirt and fire
We return to the ground
When we retire

Back to the river of dirt and fire

Summer is coming
I can't believe it's true
Where all you were issued
Are turning into you

Take me back to the place
Of golden slumbers
Where I was happy
And you were my middle name

Take me back to the river of dirt
Take me back to the river of dirt

And I grew up
In the houses made of lead
The walls were white, the stairs were sharp
The scent of summer lead

Take me back to the river of dirt
Take me back to the river of dirt",River of Dirt
