Chris Lee,"Strolling along country roads with my baby. 
It starts to rain, it begins to pour. 
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. 
I feel a shiver run up my spine.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 

After a while we run under a tree. 
I turn to her and she kisses me. 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.
Sharing our love under stormy skies.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feelinside",Laughter in the Rain
Chris Leigh,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me
Chris Lightcap,"I dig a pony
Well you can celebrate anything you want
Well you can celebrate anything you want
Ooh.

I do a road hog
Well you can penetrate any place you go
Yes you can penetrate any place you go
I told you, all I want is you.
Ev'rything has got to be just like you want it to

I pick a moon dog
Well you can radiate ev'rything you are

Chris Lowe,"
Yeah, Chris Lowe
(Okay, it's Fort Knox; Chuck Chillout - let's go)

[Verse One: Chris Lowe]
I'm in line to see the club rock
Fly shorties all over lookin too hot
Tryin to get a spot, tryin to see some ass drop
Bend over, let me put it in a padlock
Backwards, full of hydro
In New York, or New Haven, or Chicago
Oh yeah, by the way, my name Chris Lowe
Move ya hips lows, love it when ya lips blow
Damn - shorty's standin by the coat check
Tryin to get her on the mic for a throat check
Chris poke her first night, that's a sure bet
Got her so wet, on her jeans, full jet
Damn, mami get me stuck
With them tight-ass jeans and she lickin her lips
Shake your ass like you havin a seizure
And girl we gon' freak for a week in the beat so let's go

[Chorus x2]
Let's go, I'm feelin ya flow
Yo' lips and yo' eyes, hips and yo' thighs (let's go)
Let's go, it's Knox and Chris so
We gon' take you on a ride and make it worldwide (let's go)

[Verse Two: Fort Knox]
Knox smoke trees by the ounces
Bumrush the club, I'm bigger than the bouncers (move)
I turn accounts to a trampoline
And my stroke so good it'll cramp a spleen (yeah)
I'm tryin to find me a go-go chick
That can bounce up and down on my pogo stick (bounce)
I'm tellin you girl, your ass is the one
More junk in your trunk than +Sanford & Son+ (oh no!)
And baby girl had a thong made of licorice (okay)
Real ticklish, kiss her on her clitoris
All the chicks wanna check for me
They call me Robo-Knox, I'm a sex machine
And I like 'em real thick like a milkshake (real thick)
With a sick waist, shake it 'til ya hips break
Knox be the same night Knox freak her
Spray white shit on her face like Noczema, let's go

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Chris Lowe]
She got a ass like Gabrielle Union's
I wanna smash, put somethin in the womb and
Shorty face like Vivica Fox
I only hit it one time and I pass it to Knox
Full blast and we chillin with Chuck
And she know she gon' get it if she get in the truck
I like the style, I like your strut
Shake your ass all wild, not givin a fuck

[Verse Four: Fort Knox]
Body right and brain is amazin
Shorty ran more trains than Penn Station
Stay right and keep my pen blazin
My flow's a burnin sensation
So back it up, girl put it in my lap
I take yo' ass home, then you know it's a wrap
Let's get it goin on, yo you know where it's at
I got you, your man ain't gettin you back (let's go)

[Chorus]

",Let's Go
Chris Lowe,"[Chris Lowe]
Shoo-wop shu-wow, bring back the old style
of eighty-three, a part of me y'all don't see
I woke up this mornin and I blessed my life
Blessed the beats, struggled to my strife
Then figured it out, the Lowe don't slack
Lookin in the mirror sayin - damn, glad I'm black
The greatest discovery I once first found
Yeah run it in the ground, punk Lowe so bound
And I don't care what you freestylin about
With money all up in my pockets {niggaz} runnin they mouth
But free {shit} talk {that shit} to me, we gon' see
The big breakdown, {niggaz} is outta gas G
I used to cut the record down to the bone
Now they got me hurtin this microphone
You slipped up once, you slipped up twice
Give up them records and the mic device

[Chorus]
I see rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)
Rap goin round and round (round and round)

[Chris Lowe]
Too hot to trot, too old to get cold
Blast beats, 'til I got y'all losin control
Chris Lowe, kinda like I'm crackin ya code
At last, blast with a whole lotta soul
It's hot, even though you may think not
Who that scary cat tryin to block my shot?
For what I'm in the cut like I can't come out
to bust down the back door like {?} did shout
Told y'all {niggaz} I'm last to fold y'all
One man street team, the ill street soldier
So bust this like we in it at 6
And snatch off his ice chain with a slick mix
You the best DJ with mad fly tricks
You got the kinda style they just don't fix
You got the kinda style they just don't fix
You got the kinda style they just don't fix

[Chorus]

[Chris Lowe]
Yeah I seen it before, it happened just like this
The legends, be comin back from out the midst
They be hauntin the game, things ain't the same
y'all know the {niggaz} that was real at first, they done changed
over the years, I still got my ears
See the same old re-rocked ideas
Stop, hold up, I'm back in time
My future was yesterday, the best came to play
For y'all the fans, feel free, clap your hands
A {nigga} stand still in a be	-boy stance
And take this here, cause you can play it ten years from now
Rap goin round and round

[Chorus] - 2X",Round & Round
Chris Lowe,"Lights, camera (ACTION!)

Allow me to lace the showcase
The style and the grace on me you gon' see
Gladly, from that introduction, you get the percussion
Blast you fast there go production

Trust, took my top hat off by all means
Lay the funk {shit} down from New Haven to Queens
My stage persona, smooth like {marijuana}
And I'm off the quote, so take you a toke, don't choke

It ain't hard to see me up on the marquee
The next award winning academy nominee
Chris Lowe your bro, legendary type flow fo' sho'
That style right there gon' flow below

Put a slop on top, flip flop hip-hop
Took a nap for three years, woke up still hot
I, slow the roll for the next degree
The brother next to me is the Extra P

[Large Professor]
In top control, when I rock'n'roll
{Niggaz} want to bumrush the dominant soul
Jump start is the reflex art, strong hard and cold
Chris Lowe, make the rhymes explode

In the heat of the night, Large Pro is that excitin sound
Get around with the trey-five pound
Every time the little lady act fake I frown
Shake shake your town, check how I lay it down on the low

Bumrush ya show, like I said once befo'
Large Pro in the house, Chris Lowe
Let it connect, yo Connecticut
Make some noise when I kick it to the girls and boys

That's rough and on the corner, puffin {marijuana}
Ha yeah, gettin paid up front, forever on and beyond
Pass the baton, to my {nigga} and relax
Count stacks, Extra P is a don

[Chorus 2X: Chris Lowe]
Uncut action, pure satisfaction
Wild, bustin out of the frame with the style
Uncut action, pure satisfaction
Wild, bustin out of the frame with the style

[Chris Lowe]
Bust out the frame, blast off top speed
The super soul seeker, funky stoned fiend
'Bout to funk you with this yo split the scene
Your flabbergast ass is lost, that's what I mean

This here gon' be heard from the front to the rear
No doubt, slicked out, for the grand premier
Devestatin to your mind, freakin what you can't hear
Why'all know, Chris Lowe gon' be stuck in your ears

See why'all be seein whassup, peep it out like a fox
Pop it in and out on {niggaz} like a jack in the box
One time, and you don't stop
So get down, to the sound you see

I got the beats that lie, got the beats galo'
Got the beats that you never ever heard before
Now if you say you heard my beats, we gon' have to fight
'Cause I just looped up the funk {shit} last night

Chris Mann,"There are roads
In this life that we all travel
There are scars and there are battles where we roam
When we are lost
Wherever we may go
There will always lead you home

There are roads
That have lead me to another
To a fried or to a lover I have known
For every turn
Is a year that I have grown
As I walk along these roads

Some are long and some are weathered
Some will lead you through a storm
When you've gone astray
You will find your way
As you walk along these roads

There where times 
When I stumbled and I wondered
But every choice and every step I don't regret 
'Cause I have lived and have loved like no other
I won't feel what lies there

Some are long and some are weathered
Some will lead you through a storm
When you've gone astray
You will find your way
As you walk along these roads

There are roads in this life that I have traveled
There are scars and there are battles, this I know
'Cause I'd be lost, but no matter where I go
They will one day lead me home
They will one day lead me home",Roads
Chris Mann,"Maybe I didn't love you,
Quite as often as I could have.
And maybe I didn't treat you,
Quite as good as I should have.
If I made you feel second best.
I'm sorry I was blind.
You were always on my mind.
You were always on my mind.
Maybe I didn't hold you,
All those lonely, lonely times.
And I guess I never told you,
I'm sorry so happy that your mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me,
Tell me that your sweet love hasn’t died.
And give, give me,
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied.
‘Cause you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind",Always on My Mind
Chris Mann,"And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky

I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes

And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial

I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes

Did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind?

I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
My mind, my mind
Off you",The Blower's Daughter

Summer long in sun or weather
Some will lead you through a storm
When you’ve gone a strain

I don't wanna try and hide it

What you do to my life

Want to let it go

My darling I'm falling in love with you
There's something colliding in my heart
Love has got me now
My darling, I'm falling

Every word that you say is like a prayer that I'm praying
Every minute of the day I can feel you with me
Don't feel the weight of the world cos you keep me flying
Don't wanna let it go, wanna let it go

My darling I'm falling in love with you
There's something colliding in my heart

Chris Mann,"Picture perfect memories,
Scattered all around the floor.
Reaching for the phone ‘cause,
I can't fight it any more.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.
It's a quarter after one,
I'm all alone and I need you now.
I said I wouldn't call,
But I lost all control
And I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now.
Another shot of whiskey.
Can't stop looking at the door.
I’m wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before.

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.
It's a quarter after one,
I'm a little drunk
And I need you now.
I said I wouldn't call,
But I lost all control
And I need you now.

And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now.
I need you now!
Guess I'd rather hurt
Than feel nothing at all.
It's a quarter after one,
I'm all alone and I need you now.
And I said I wouldn't call,
I lost all control
And I need you now.

And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now!
I just need you now!
I need you now!
It's a quarter after one,
I still alone,
And I need you,
I need you now.",Need You Now
Chris Mann,"On a night like this,
I could fall in love, I could fall in love with you
In this dark so dense, we talk so soft
The way young lovers do.

The day's last sigh
Turns a cool night breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves
I?ve hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is a Judah's kiss
The day's last sigh
Turns a cool night breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves
I?ve hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is a Judah's kiss

Chris Mann,"Tell me that you need me
Tell me that you care
You can tell me that you're close to me
And always will be there
You can tell me not to hurry
Before I walk I have to crawl

Anything at all

But don't say it
Don't scream it
Don't whisper it
Don't even think it
Don't call it love unless you mean it
Unless you mean it
Tell me all your secrets
And all your little lies
You can tell me why you're up at night
I've always wondered why
You can tell me when you're flying

Chris Mann,"I used to rule the world, seas would rise when I gave the word.
Now in the morning I sleep alone, sweep the streets I used to own.

I used to roll the dice, feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!
One minute I held the key, next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castle stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand.

I hear Jerusalem bells ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing.
Be my mirror, my sword and shield, my missionaries in a foreign field.
For some reason I can't explain, once you go there was never
Never an honest world but that was when I ruled the world.

It was the wicked and wild wind, blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become.
Revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string, oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing.
Be my mirror, my sword and shield, my missionaries in a foreign field.
For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name.
Never an honest world but that was when I ruled the world.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

I hear Jerusalem bells ringing, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing.
Be my mirror, my sword and shield, my missionaries in a foreign field.
For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name.
Never an honest word but that was when I ruled the world.",Viva la Vida

While you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh

You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love 
Guys are so hard to trust
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl 
The one who gives it all away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Don't try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget 
I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset 
Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah that's what I said

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Chris McKhool,"It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Tell him to just get out,

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

Soon begins bewitching me

That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

I know that I am living the dream

I dreamed I was the pilot
Of a ship lost out at sea
And as my eyes filled up with blood
My ears rang with cries of mutiny

Ashes to ashes
Trust to dust
I don't know what it means
To be blinded by something that you love so much
I think I must be living the dream
I think that I am living the dream

A flock of birds flew from my mouth
And as I fell to my knees
I could hear those hollow bones
All echo back to me

Dancing on the head of a pin
Sleep our days away on the edge of a blade
But at night we all go out
Dancing on the head of a pin

All we want is to love
And to be loved in return
But for every breath you take
There's a heart somewhere that breaks
And a promise that's come all undone

Because we're dancing on the head of a pin
Dancing on the head of a pin
Sleep our days away on the edge of a blade
But at night we all go out
Dancing on the head of a pin

As sure as the sun will rise
Or the rain does fall
Love will find a way to make a king into a slave
Or a man into a child

Chris Mills,"Stars are falling from the sky
And virgins all from the parapet
With arms outstretched, they have leapt
They are tired of waiting
For a groom they know will never come
Now that the King of Kings has gone out of his head
He's whispering to fools in their beds
And giving them the power

And it's late, but it's not too late
We can still make our escape
I've tunneled beneath the subway line
So take a last look from the corner of your eye
At the city lights all fading

Now that the sky has come crashing to the ground
And we've played back all the black boxes we found
On the corner kids are moving to the sound
Of history repeating
So say goodbye to all that you love best
And hope we find it all again somewhere out west
For in these skyscrapers united we will stand
Only in our isolation

And I'm high, but I'm not that high
If we had a car, I think I could still drive
From here to the Berlin Wall
Or the bottom of the ocean

And it's late, but it's not too late
We can still make our escape
And though it's sad, it's not that sad
For soon the memories of the hard times that we've had
Will be like city lights all fading",Escape from New York
Chris Mills,"Daddy, won't you tell me
Everything about the heart?
Where it stops and where it starts
And where to let it go
Won't you tell me
So that I will know?

For it has loved a girl
And it has loved a boy
It has been set fire
And it has been destroyed
But still I hear it beating
Like that song you used to sing me all the time

I just want to know
If love is real

Is it high or is it low?
Is it fast or is it slow?
Or is it never-ending
Forever spinning like a wheel?

And, Martha, will you please stop crying?

To try and conjure up nostalgia
For something that never was

And outside a chorus of June bugs was singing
We are all just waiting in the wings

How could I forget the night that we first met?
I was playing in the parlor
You begged me for a song, and when I got it wrong
You said you were the master's daughter

Then underneath the moon we began to spoon
While outside a chorus of June bugs was singing
We are all just waiting in the wings

And though we thought the evil empire
Would be returned into sand
It seems now all our battles were in vain
But if the half-light from this half-life
We are living goes disappearing
I know that our love will still remain

Now we're on the run with our sabers and our guns
Waiting for the final hour
When love will play its hand and the overlords of man
Will be stripped of all their power

Over parking lots and movie seats
Picking up clues in the threads of my coat

Chris Mills,"It started with words in a bar on a late winter's evening
By the first flush of spring, sides were chosen
And lines were drawn
The red summer sun set on fields of banners waving
And the autumn leaves fell like bodies
From the battlements
We dug in, played to win, for we knew
Our cause was righteous
It did not matter that we knew not what it was
For the radio said that the lives of our wives and babies
Were under attack by vampires and aliens

In the mud, we suffered the frost and the cannon fire
As generals fed on the breast of the war machine
Commanding us to die for their gilded pleasures
While maggots ate all of our rations clean
A thought like a thread sent out
From beneath the Atlantic
Carried news of the fast-approaching enemy line
As my lips drank deep the blood of a terrible monster
I recognized two dead eyes and a face like mine

We broke ranks, smoked and drank
In the heart of an unholy city
Traded chocolate with children
Hid Vermeers beneath our coats
Made love to the whores on the steps of the Tower of Babel
And woke with steely blades pressed to our throats
A thousand years in a cage, we thought ourselves forgotten
Prisoners of something we did not understand
When word finally came that the fighting all was over
Though we could return, we could not go home again","Untitled, No. 1"

Sunday's takeaway welded on my Elvis tray
It's a pound a can in the garden all day

Start at noon, keep on going through 'till two

Yes some say
They were the best days
Out of our minds
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's eight o'clock time to catch the next bus to town
When the drink is in, the wit is most definitely out
Late bars, fight starts, between my brother and I
Get kicked out so we hold tight and take it outside

Dodging cars, new scars, fighting out on the road
Knees me in the chest my head and ass hits the floor
Swallowed tongue, what we done, someone's hand in my mouth
Got to pull it back out on a bank holiday Monday

Street fighting
Yet some day
You get out

I want to stick him real hard with a kitchen knife
But we share the same bed in my mam's house tonight
I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait, until he walks up the lane

Chris Murray,"I want to talk to you today about Moon Records,
I sent them a tape that I had made about a month ago.
I said that the band is breaking up, I'm trying to go solo,
The man on the phone called back to say, that Mr. Bucket said no.

He don't know if the rude boys, like you boys,
Will like my stuff, but he know
The one man show will never go
And the tape it sounds too rough.

I know it's true, they'll never like what they never get to hear,
It's been that way for ska over the years.
But why should the ska world cover its ears
To the sounds of my blood, sweat and tears?

When I want to play ska,
I want to play ska for all of you.
I want to play ska for all of you,
Cause ska is what I do.

And so I've come down to New York to demonstrate to you,
That Venice Shoreline Chris is paying respect to the roots.
So clap your hands, sway your hips, get into a soulful groove,
Hear this music straight from my heart to you.

I want to play ska,
I want to play ska for all of you.
I want to play ska for all of you,
Cause ska is what I do.

I want to play ska,
I want to play ska for all of you.
I want to play ska for all of you,
Cause the ska is what I do.

And I think that the rude boys, like you boys,
Might like my stuff, and I know
The one man show is here we go
And the tape it sounds just raw enough.",Cooper Station Blues

And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

With every paper I'd deliver

And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes

In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field

A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick

'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

Chris Nemec,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me

Chris Nole,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky mountain high

It's Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky

Chris Norman,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you

Chris Opperman,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

We push and pull like a magnet do

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

Chris Rea,"Could have been a long hot summer night
When all the stars were shining bright
Against the blue
Could have been that famous decade scene
Top hats and tails, spinning 'round the room

And all I remember is not wanting the music to end
And all I remember is feeling a need that I could not hide
Don't take away those dancing shoes
Don't take away those dancing shoes
Don't take away that boy's dancing shoes

And ever since that very night
I found me a guiding light, light the way
To turn off the music is to turn off the light in my soul
So just let it shine mister

One more time for me and my babe
Don't take away those dancing shoes
Without the rhythm you got the blues
Don't take away those dancing shoes

Chris Rea,"Hello friend, where you been so long?
Time goes by, so easy it sleeps away
Just like a shadow at the end of the day

Hello friend, how are things for you these days?
Some guy from way-back-when, he mentioned your name
Did he ever get back to you?
Ah, you know I told him to

Sometimes I turn and I swear I hear you call
And I often wonder how we lost what we knew
Seems it gone in the wind, washed away in the rain
And the years go by and by

The bridges you burned, long sinced turned into ashes
When there were no reasons, now the river runs dry
Seems it gone in the wind, washed away in the rain
And the years go by and by
Where you been so long",Hello Friend

Pressing through the night

Screaming for reasons or just a way out
I put the shirt off my back on a wager that says
There's one every night from my old school yard days
I hear you say one golden rule
One golden rule

There's been times I've been stood in the wind and the rain
Freezing and busted and tricked out of luck
And I cursed my teachers for all of their reading
What we needed most can't be found in them books
One golden rule

Chris Rea,"In waves of people you can lose your feet
You've got to stay hard, to the ground
It gets so easy now to lose your way

Stops you dead like a cold steel wall
The ghost of yesteryear's is toughing you
And as sure as God you'll fall
And I see me and I see you
I see it all just like it used to be
And all the reasons why it started out
Hit you hard with every bell
The choir practice in the empty hall
Is a sound that you know so well
Like something lost inside your overcoat
You find it later, by mistake
You lost it all a thousand years ago
And you pray it's not too late
And I see me and I see you
I see it all just like it used to be
And I see me and I see you

Chris Rea,"I was born and raised on steel river
I see it all like it was yesterday
The ships and bridges they were all delivered
From Sydney harbour to the Cisco bay

And I met my love down on steel river
We served our dreams and spent our childhood days
In rainy streets we'd kiss away the shivers
And hide from fear inside the latest craze

Dancing to Motown
Making love with Carole King record playing
And oh how I loved you
Say goodbye steel river

Ten thousand bombers hit the steel river
And many died to keep her running free
And she survived but now she's gone forever
Her burning heart is just a memory

And I ran away from life on steel river
Luck or not I gladly took the break
The odds were low the chances nearly zero
A chance it was I had to take
Say goodbye steel river

They say that salmon swim in steel river
They say it's good to see them back again
I know it hurts to see what really happened
I know one salmon ain't no good to them

It was they taught and all they ever knew
And they believed that she would keep their children

Chris Rea,"Born and raised in wilderness
Of suburban shops and schools
How she tried and tried to be satisfied
With a job on the typing pool
She hated the smell of carbon paper
The office so smoky and dry
How she longed for the day she would make her get away
And say her last goodbye

Bows and bangles on her fingers
And silver bells on her toes
That lady has music where she wonders
That lady has music where she goes

Married a guy with prospects
And so became his wife
And that my friend is the end of the story
'Cause that was the rest of his life
She could have been a movie star
She could have made the scene
Right or wrong she still hangs on
Each night to her favourite dream

And silver bells on her toes

That lady has music where she goes",Bows and Bangles

Standing here in the rain
I've been thinking how, how much happier
I have been since you came
Staring down at the sidewalk shining
Satin winds floating down
Change the crystals on ladies faces
I think I'll stick around
Laden gutters, flowing over
Hit the streets and explode
Young girls laughing and make up streaming
Go running down the road

I can see him now, his face lit up in neon
One hand up in the air as he turns towards the crowd
His songs of silver arrows they tried to roll into gold
With diamond tips from painted lips
Designed and ready to be sold

They say he could not fail

Locked in overflow
Sometimes I swear I could spin these old wheels
Just let it go

Runaway

Is it something that you hear
Coming through the waves on the radio
Or something that you see gently taps your memory
And shoots you down
Those hometown thoughts, school yard dreams and yesterdays
Moving in I just put my head down and drift away
And we're moving up and down, in and out of town
We're all searching for that piece of higher ground somewhere

Runaway",Runaway

And you know how you feel inside

On a tree lined avenue
I see the sweetest little creature
Coming into my view

Of that bright little angel
That shines like the morning sun
Well my brother steps in, faster that light
And he sweet talks this angel, clean out of sight

I say hey you, you with that look in your eye
Hey you, you with that look in your eye

Well she moves like a river
From her head down to her toes
It's less a way of walking
More a total flow
And I say to myself, I wonder
I wonder if she knows
What she's doing to me and my brother
From our heads down to our toes
Well he's up there on the corner now
He's playing up that Romeo like only he know how

You know my friend there's nothing that you can really do
Just follow on behind her veil of deepest purple haze

Intoxicating laughter that spins you high and low
Dangerous times are these, but oh so wonderfully new
Laugh along you fool, can't you they're laughing at you
Lost in the haze
Of love's strange ways

I could not say

Two thousand reasons
Maybe more
Eight hundred chances on faraway shores

Searching for more
Deep down inside me burning
Reasons for the learning

Now you can pick up reasons so easily
Where you've been and where you've got to be
And when the truth don't show you'll always see
Lots of reasons

And pretty soon you've got a heavy load
Dragging those reasons down an endless road
I got to thinking and i got to see
So many reasons coming at me

The one that leaves you high and dry
He says you still owe him, there's a reason why
He'll leave you crying till the tears run dry
He's the one, always the one with all the reasons
So many reasons the come and they go
The reasons for them i'll never know
I've seen so many, they've come and they've gone
I've turned all mine in and i'm happy with one

I could have played the graceful one so well

And tiptoed out upon the highest wire
The truth to tell upon a rope too thin
And so the fall of treachery begins
But oh to see the starlet's smiling face
So eagerly awaits to take the place
I tried to fall in a clean and graceful way
You could have said I would have given way

And I hear him laugh the way that I did
But I hear him screaming and I hear him cry

When allegiance asks the questions
Old freedom twists and turns
And chokes on codes of honour
On the sword of no return

And it's the curse of the traveller
The curse of the traveller
Got a hold of me
And it won't let you be

And in sleepless nights
You'll call her name
And feel loneliness cold to the bone
And when the daylight breaks
This old tired heart aches
To be such a long way, such a long way from home

And you long for the harbourlights
But you'll never be free
Of the craving for refuge
And the call of the sea
Always wanting to sell up
But always needing to buy

Oh I'm gazing in that gate of dreams
Underneath that midnight sky
Cause there's a diamond sun everywhere she goes
And there ain't no other way
I'm gonna dream tonight
By that pale moonlight
Till the morning comes my way

And I'm walking fine

Like 'Bleak House fog' seems everywhere
The truth has frozen into stone
And hope lies freezing in the midnight air
Though dark our days may seem

So I will light a candle for you
Keep it burning in the night
And pray that you are all right
I will light a candle for you

When school yard heroes disappeared
The little girl, she stands alone

They flew us in from the Hamburg strip
The taste of Dusseldorf still on our lips

And on the bus there's a friend of mine
We go way back to the scene of the crime
We sit up front and share a cigarette
And try to remember what we tried to forget

He said ""Do you recall?""

The burnin' passion and the cold wet feet
Three tricky miles home every night
Dodgin' from the shadows underneath those amber lights

With a face that I knew like my own, reflected in my window

Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows

Oh, I got red lights on the run
But soon there'll be a freeway yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

Though you can't hear me
When I get trough
And feel you near me
Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
Just the same

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
I'm driving home for Christmas, yea
Get my feet on holy ground
So I sing for you

When I get trough
Oh and feel you near me

In the morning of a new life
When the sun comes shining through

When the grey skies turn to blue
In the morning of a new life

Chris Rene,"I've been left for dead here
A thousand miles from home
With a hole in my chest right here
And a bullet in my done oh no

Feels like I lost my life
Guess I played the game so I paid the price
But it was cold at it the way you left me here
Now I've the leaving dead guy since you disappeared

And I know we both made mistakes
Sometimes that's just what it takes
Still I just can't let you go 

[Chorus]
Just call out my name (and I'll find you)
No matter what's in the way (I'll remind you)
Nothing can stop me don't care what they said
Girl if you need me I'm coming back from the dead

It feels like I'm stranded nowhere else to go
It's worse than I imagined a life without a soul
Since you blew past I took my last breath
I guess nothing last maybe not even death
But that was cold hearted the way you played your part
Now I'm the living dead guy since you took my heart

And I know we both made mistakes
Sometimes that's just what it takes
Still I just can't let you go 

[Chorus]

So I'm laying here 6 feet deep in the ground
Ever since you left you're you're you're not around
But it just ain't living without you by my side
'Cause only your love can bring me back to life

That makes me a believer
Even got it inked un on my arms

I've been thinking
(Ayo Ayo)
I got a reason

Make a plan and start all over

See we all could be happy people
If we stop feeding our own egos
And live our lives right where we are
Instead of where we wanna be

Are you ready to break these chains
Are you ready to find a way
We were meant for more than this
Times is all we got to give
We don't have to live this way
Are you ready to break these chains
Ready to break these chains

Yo this ain't no fairy tale
I made life long friends in jail
I love them 'til the day I die
Uh huh yep

Crazy in a whole another lane that's amazing
Just to let you know yo I'm coming from the other side

Chris Rene,"I learned to make 'em run like the R+everend
But I never had a 9 milli or a mac 11 
I was enticed by the G life
When I met them boys from the east side

Yeah making money in the street life
You could get stunted drinking honey from the bee hive
Made my way through the troubles sometimes
You could say I always had something else on my mind

Yeah I've been all about that mean code
When I was younger always look up to the hero
Everyone else they liked Scarface, DeNiro
They used used call me a weirdo

[Chorus: x4]
If you ever felt like your world is over
Thought about just giving up
Feeling like you're fucked up when you're sober
And your best shot's not enough
Have you ever thought about just ending
Even toy with the curtain call
I know how you feel right now my friend see,
I've been backed on against the wall
It's gonna be OK, hey hey

I remember I was rapping in the twilight saying
It would be so nice living in the limelight
It was 1999 right I never saw it coming 
Grinding hit me blindside 
Been so many years since I looked back 
I know that it's this music makes me look at my life 
In a different perspective to many studio sessions
Got my music obsession without no musical lessons
Learned to play punk rock listened to other lessons
I was raised west side and used my mind as a weapon
I got cracked a few times and I spat a few lines
Ain't saying that it's cool just glad that I survived

[Chorus: x4]

Before this day is done
And it falls down out the sun
Just let me hear you say
It's gonna be OK ,hey hey

That makes my heart stop
I don't know the way to say goodnight
Cause she don't want me, to go nowhere
Without her there, she's everywhere
I don't need trouble, just some music
And a little chance to sing my song

That's why I gotta run, why I gotta run, baby, baby

I woke up to hear her on my telephone
Talking crazy, she said come over now nobody's home
I said baby, I don't know if I should go tryna take it slow
I don't need trouble but I choose it
At least that's the way it seems yeah

Combusting like nothing, now listen,
It takes education, to change your reputation,
From bad to good, you're gettin' better now you're elevating,
They be singing, family's hanging, everybody's chillin'
Not gonna stop this, living on the feeling,
Man this is the real thing, tell me can you feel me,

Chris Rice,"Grass is always greener on the other side
The search is never over in the pastures of my mind
Is the meaning of happiness drowning in smiles
Or that dreadful world I left behind?
O Lord grant the grace to accept who I am
Who I am, that You have designed

I know there's a plan that you have up your sleeve
Rabbi, teach me the faith to believe
It's the only way my life will ever make sense to me
Oh, la-da-da, la-da-da, la-da-da

I can never measure, â??cause better things are all around
I'd be bitter and chained to the beauty I never found
But the strength of my Lord's love, it shatters the scale
And its depth gives a new peak to climb
And it grants me the grace to accept who I am
Who I am, that You have designed

I know there's a plan that You have up Your sleeve
Rabbi, teach me the faith to believe
It's the only way my life will ever make sense to me

And my resting place is taught by love
It's the only peace I know of, oh I know of

So when my heart is beaten by the standard of the law
I just remember Jesus, and I've found my favor with God
â??Cause the fire of my Lord's love it burns up the scale
And its depth gives a new peak to climb
And it grants me the grace to accept who I am
Who I am, that You have designed

And I know there's a plan that You have up Your sleeve

And they laugh at my hope when all hope is gone
But I'll just keep prayin' when answers won't come

Am I the fool, am I just a fool
For standing alone while they mock Your name
""Well if your God is so good, tell us why all the pain?""
I'm not sure, not so sure that God is to blame

'Cause life's not as fair as we all wanted

Where the innocent die, we ask why
And still we await the reply...

And blessed are the hands that keep givin? but never receive

Blessed is the heart that gets broken but keeps holdin' on
Holdin' on for another day
'Cause that's what it means... it means holdin' on for another day

Chris Rice,"Fading memories ignored
I crawl across the forest floor
Pool reflects an orphan child
Dirty, lost, alone and wild
Fatherless and nameless still
Fallen heart and broken, will
There ever be a place where I belong
I cower 'neath the monster trees
And try to stand on tired feet
But gravity knocks me to the ground
Where I give up, and tears roll down
I claw the dust and beg the end
Curse the day that I began
To hope there'd be a place where I belong
I hear a sound I recognize
You lift my chin and seek my eyes
Song of love you sing to me
I ache to sing it back to Thee

Brother Jesus leads the way
Follow to the place where you belong!""
How did I miss this wondrous song?

Chris Rice,"He shares a room outside with a dozen other guys
And the only roof he knows is that sometimes starry sky
A tattered sleeping bag on a concrete slab is his bed
And its too cold to talk tonight
So I just sit with him instead and think

[Chorus]
How did I find myself in a better place
I can't look down on the frown on the other guys face
Cause when I stoop down low, look him square in the eye
I get a funny feeling, I just might be dealing
With the face of Christ

After sixteen years in a cold, gray prison yard
Somehow his heart is soft, but keeping simple faith is hard
He lays his Bible open on the table next to me
And as I hear his humble prayer
I feel his longing to be free someday

[Chorus]

See you had no choice which day you would be born
Or the color of your skin, or what planet you'd be on
Would your mind be strong, would your eyes be blue or brown
Whether daddy would be rich, or if momma stuck around at all

So if you find yourself in a better place
You can't look down on the frown on the other guys face
You gotta stoop down low, look him square in the eye

How did I get so far from home
The lies dissipating
Revealing I'm so alone
And I remember now how strong love can be
And I wonder how did I ever leave

Burn your fire on the altar
Leave a candle on the porch
I'm still too far away to see it
But I'm aching for its warmth
And I'm so tired and cold and dark and lonesome
But still I hear your song inside
So sing it louder if you want me home tonight
Sing it loud now, 'cause I'm comin' home tonight

This isn't the first time
I've wandered away from home before
You'd have every reason
To slam and dead-bolt the door
But I remember now how strong your love can be
And I wonder how you might welcome me

But I'm aching for its warmth
And I'm so tired and cold and dark and lonesome
But still I hear your song inside
So sing it louder if you want me home tonight
Sing it loud now, 'cause I'm comin home tonight

Into your arms, to my back yard
Where I used to play
How I miss the days...

So burn your fire on the altar
Leave a candle on the porch

Sing it loud now, 'cause I'm comin' home tonight",Home Tonight
Chris Rice,"Every day is a journal page
Every man holds a quill and ink
And there's plenty of room for writing in
All we do is believe and think
So will you compose a curse
Or will today bring the blessings
Fill the page with rhyming verse
Or some random sketchings

[Chorus] 
Teach us to count the days
Teach us to make the days count
Lead us in better ways
Somehow our souls forgot
Life means so much
Life means so much
Life means so much
 
Every day is a bank account
And time is our currency
So no one's rich, nobody's poor
We get twenty-four hours each
So how are you gonna spend
Will you invest or squander
Try to get ahead 
Or help someone who's under
 
[Chorus]

Has anybody lived who knew the value of a life
And didn't He give His own 
To show the worth of yours and mine?
 
[Chorus]

Every day is a gift you've been given
Make the most of the time every minute you're living",Life Means So Much
Chris Rice,"He rode his wagon into town
A gaudy spectacle
And every gray November brought him there
Always entertaining
Prestidigitating
Pulling rabbits from thin air
He would wave his magic wand
He would say the magic words
Working up a miracle
Puttin? on a show
Changing what I thought to be
Unchangeable reality
Wish I had a magic wand of my own
Now twenty-three Novembers later
The prestidigitator
Still holds a power in my mind
?Cause I?d like a quick and easy way
To look inside and make a change
A magic wand would do me fine
I would wave my magic wand
I would say the magic words
Working up a miracle
Puttin? on a show
Changing what I thought to be
Unchangeable reality
If I had a magic wand of my own
I would wave it over me and over you
And over all this crazy world
And make it right
Oh and there's so much I?d change
If I could take the easy way!
I would wave my magic wand
I would say the magic words
Working up a miracle
Puttin? on a show
Changing what I thought to be
Unchangeable reality
I would wave my magic wand
I would say the magic words
Working up a miracle
Puttin? on a show
Changing what I thought to be
Unchangeable reality
If I had a magic wand of my own
The only way to really change
Is simple choices everyday
Obey the Spirit-whisper in my soul
With the help of God, a little time
Can change a heart, renew a mind
Without a magic wand He?ll work a miracle...",Magic Wand
Chris Rice,"Standing on the edge of the dock
With the wind in our faces
Been watchin' the waves roll in
And it feels like we're sailing
Now Russell chimes in with his youthful imagination
""What if we saw him there
Walking out on the water?""
No time for splashing around in shallow theology
He just invited me out into the deep simplicity
And I'm sailing with Russell
Chasing that heartbeat
Playing on sunshine
Laughin' with heaven

It's like I'm walkin' on the water
And floatin' in the freedom
And thankin' the Savior

Filled with some crazy days
Been sailin' our separate ways
Across the blue ocean
But the good wind brought us around
And time made us older
But not on the inside
We?re still talkin' 'bout sailin'
Catchin' the wind from the good times
Fillin' our sails with the memories
Feelin' the tide carry us back out to the deep simplicity

As the events of the day
Keep burning deep in your mind

You're not really alone

Into a childhood memory
Of a God Who never sleeps
Is He still lookin' down on me?
Does He really care?

Chris Rice,"The church's one foundation 
Is Jesus Christ her Lord; 
She is his new creation 
By water and the Word. 
From heaven he came and sought her 
To be his holy bride; 
With his own blood he bought her, 
And for her life he died. 

Elect from every nation, 
Yet one o'er all the earth; 
Her charter of salvation, 
One Lord, one faith, one birth; 
One holy name she blesses, 
Partakes one holy food, 
And to one hope she presses, 
With every grace endued. 

Though with a scornful wonder 
We see her sore oppressed, 
By schisms rent asunder, 
By heresies distressed, 
Yet saints their watch are keeping; 
Their cry goes up, ""How long?"" 
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song. 

Mid toil and tribulation, 
And tumult of her war, 
She waits the consummation 
Of peace forevermore; 
Till, with the vision glorious, 
Her longing eyes are blest, 
And the great church victorious 
Shall be the church at rest. 

Yet she on earth hath union 
With God the Three in One, 
And mystic sweet communion 
With those whose rest is won. 
O happy ones and holy! 
Lord, give us grace that we 
Like them, the meek and lowly, 
On high may dwell with thee.",The Church's One Foundation

Mount of Thy redeeming love

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Here there by Thy great help I've come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

Oh, that day when freed from sinning
I shall see Thy lovely face
Clothed then in the blood washed linen
How I'll sing Thy wondrous grace
Come, my Lord, no longer tarry
Take my ransomed soul away
Send Thine angels now to carry
Me to realms of endless day

Daily I'm constrained to be

They bend on hovering wing,

Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;

Come swiftly on the wing;

Behold your King, before him lowly bend
Behold your King, before him lowly bend

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all our hearts we praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord, then ever, ever praise we
His power and glory ever more proclaim

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Set the time machine to 1975
We'd just found out that momma's gonna have another kid
Back in the 8th grade

Remember the days when life was not so mysterious
Follow me down the hall to the cafeteria
Where the worst thing I could mess up
Was dipping yesterday's corn dog in last week's ketchup
Back in the 8th grade

Why does the past always seem safer?
Maybe because at least we know we made it
And why do we worry about the future?
When every day will come just the way the Lord ordained it
You can believe it, yeah, just like the 8th grade

Step out into the hall and feel the moment pass
Slam the locker, there's the bell, we're runnin' to class
'Cause Mr. Jackson told us,""Don't be late for geometry again""
We're back in the 8th grade

I drop my books, sit down and mess with my hair
Suzie looks at me and smiles, I'm walkin' on air
Then I hear my name, I missed the question, I mumble somethin'
The class is laughing, oh I love the 8th grade

Why does the past always seem safer?
Maybe because at least we know we made it
And why do we worry about the future?
When every day will come just the way the Lord ordained it

Chris Rice,"Looked out my window last night
From my pillow and I
Saw the willow weepin' a causal sigh

Man in the moon looked rather
Sad and confused as if he'd
Become a mirror into my watery eyes
I dreamed and prayed through the night
Please send some grace with your mornin' light

Then he sent you along like a summer day
With a blue sky smile on your funny face
And a bird flew by singin'
?Everything's gonna be ok, yeah?

So we laughed all day with the man in the moon
And we thanked the good Lord for the afternoon
'Cause he showed me His love by sendin' me you
And it's ok now, everything's ok

I opened my window tonight
Hear the rain fallin' light
Whispering that everything's alright

Long, low, and gentle rumble
Starts in the west and tumbles
Across the corners of the colorless sky
I blow a kiss through the dark
Sails on the thunder and reaches Heaven's heart

'Cause he sent you along like a summer day
If a blue sky smile on your funny face
And a bird flew by singin'
?Everything's gonna be ok, yeah?

She's got a Bible by the bed, a prayer journal, and a fish on her car 
She makes sure to bow her head and give thanks in every restaurant 
But is that enough? 

c'mon Becky, let's go for a ride 
If I'm driving too fast then I apologize 
But there's a world out there that we left behind

Looks like a reckless road, and a sacrifice 
And I'm crazy scared it may cost our lives 
But then I remember Jesus died 
So c'mon Becky 
Let's go for a ride 

I'm rolling up to Becky's house on my Sunday drive 
I have to laugh to myself 'cause it looks exactly like mine 
I smile and wave at all the happy people strolling by 
We've got the same walk, same talk, and the same sparkle in our eyes

Chris Rice,"Sweetest days of childhood, playing in the deep woods
Stomping through the creek and feeling, oh, so much alive
We're camping in the forest, we join the cricket chorus
And hum our songs of gratitude around a crackling fire

And out here in the stillness, I found my house of worship
With column trees and canopy of stars, here in my cathedral

It was beneath the blue skies, I ran down to be baptized
I felt the river wash me clean and dried beneath the sun
And to this day believing I'm wide awake or dreaming
Scan the ancient sky and understand where I belong

'Cause out here in the stillness, I find my house of worship
With column trees and canopy of stars, here in my cathedral

This is where I find my soul, out where holy men of old
First knelt in soil and thanked you for the rain
Wrote the songs that filled the air, herald angels sang their prayer
Out beneath your darling constellations
So let me off and wander, robin song and thunder
Surrounding me with stained glass leaves that change with every breeze

And out here in the stillness, I find my house of worship
With column trees and canopy of stars, here in my cathedral",My Cathedral

Us together somehow

A prayer for the first time

And asking why it has to hurt so bad
Where's the limit to the pain her heart can take

Send a little help from your side
Cause somebody's lost down here
Let him wing his way through the dark
Carry some of your love into her heart
Can you spare an angel

Feels the cold and hears the thunder cry
While the rain keeps pouring down
Her only answer from the lonely sky
She has no idea how much you love her
Or how much you care
So would you choose one of your best 
To be the answer to my prayer

Maybe an angel can lead her lonesome heart away to Jesus side

And carried far away
And precious blood has washed away the stain, so

Don't be afraid to crawl
And remember when you walk
Sometimes we fall, so
Fall on Jesus

Sometimes the way is lonely
And steep and filled with pain
So if your sky is dark and pours the rain, then
Cry to Jesus

O, and when the love spills over
And music fills the night
And when you can't contain your joy inside, then
Dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus
Dance for Jesus and live!

And with your final heartbeat
Kiss the world goodbye

The sun smiles, but where are you?
Wish I could hold you again
Nothing a daydream cannot mend
You smile and promise me you'll always be around
I whisper hallelujah's and sing your name out loud
But no one hears me
Well, at least for now
I'm smiling

You can't write such a comedy
Without some conspiracy
Inside there's mutiny and mayhem
My secrets all want you to know them
I shed a tear because this love can never be
But as the saying goes it doesn't hurt to dream
As long as you know
That I find it all
So amusing",Amusing
Chris Rice,"Take a good look at yourself
You're probably singing along
Lying alone in your room
Or cruisin' down an empty road
Or maybe you're on your feet
In a crowd of strangers and friends
The spotlight's on someone else
But you feel like you're part of the show
What's the magic in the music
And why does it bring us together like this
We all have a longing inside
And it keeps us singing song after song after song

We're all waiting for the best song ever
It's somewhere out there, and everyone can feel it
We keep waiting for the best song ever
And when it arrives the whole world's gonna hear it
Yeah, the best song ever
Someday we'll all be singing it together

Where will the song come from
Who's gonna find the right words
Come up with a melody
That rings in every human soul
Well dig out your instruments
Make sure they're all in tune
Ã¢??Cause nobody knows how long
But we still got some singing to do
Ã¢??Cause there's magic in the music
Just look how it brings us together like this

Chris Rice,"Was it a million miles to heaven
Too far to hear my lonely song
Or is it just my imagination I hear you humming along
I only hold you in my dreams now
I wake up with cold and empty arms
Lord help me get through this long night without you
And soon as the morning comes
Soon as the morning comes

Save me a seat at the breakfast table
Save me a dance around the Milky Way
And save me a thousand years to whisper in your ears
All I've wanted to say
Save me a smile and an angel's feather
Save me a walk down the streets of gold
And baby, we'll change our minds just like old times
And maybe we'll just fly away
Or maybe we'll stay

My lucky doll, you're in heaven before me
You were my taste of heaven here
Remember we loved to talk about it, we couldn't wait to get there
So you go on and find your way around now
But remember I'm here missing you
Do me a favor and say hey to Jesus
And tell him I'm missing him too
Tell him I'm missing him too

Then save me a seat at the breakfast table
Save me a dance around the Milky Way
And save me a thousand years to whisper in your ears
All I've wanted to say

Chris Rice,"Saw an old guy today
Staring long at a chess game
Looked like it was half-played
Then his tear splashed between
The bishop and the king...oh
He turned his face to mine
I saw the Question in his eyes
I shrugged him half a smile and walked away
It made me sad, and it made me think
And now it makes me sing what I believe

It was love that set this fragile planet rolling
Tilting at our perfect twenty-three
Molecules and men infused with holy
Finding our way around the galaxy
And Paradise has up and flown away for now
But hope still breathes and truth is always true
And just when we think it's almost over
Love has the final move

To her daughter in her pale arms
Walkin' through a rainstorm

Chris Rice,"Can you see the moon tonight
Sugar-white perfection
Radiant beams of purest light
Our hearts' connection
Carries me back to a lullaby
The sweetest song in my memory
Of Mama's voice on moonlit nights
To hush her babies, singin'

I see the moon, the moon sees me
The moon sees the one that I want to see
God bless the moon, and God bless me
And God bless the one I'm longing to see

Did you ever notice the man in the moon
He's the master of reflection
Somehow he knows and imitates
My heart's expressions
Some nights he's melting in clouds of tears
Or shining my smile like the bright sun
But look, tonight the moon looks like
He's missing someone

Chris Rice,"So go ahead and ask her
For happy ever after
'Cause nobody knows what's coming
So why not take a chance on loving?
Come on, pour the glass and tempt me
Either half-full or half-empty
'Cause if it all comes down to flavor
The glass is tipping in my favor

Life gave me lemonade, and I can't imagine why
Born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
I live life without pretending
I'm a sucker for happy endings
Thanks for the lemonade
Thanks for the lemonade

Now, take your time to answer me
For the beauty of romancing
Is to calm your trembling hand with mine
While begging love to fill your eyes
I can hardly breathe while waiting
To find out what your heart is saying
And as we're swirling in this flavor
The world is tilting in our favor

Life gave me lemonade, and I can't imagine why
Born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
I live life without pretending
I'm a sucker for happy endings
Thanks for the lemonade
Thanks for the lemonade

I've got it made
Rest in the shade
And hold my love
While God above
Stirs with a spoon
We share the moon
Smile at the bees
More sugar, please
He really loves us after all
We're gonna need another straw
We're gonna need another straw

Born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky
I live life without pretending

Chris Rice,"I heard a rumor that love will make you crazy
Well is it true?
Well that's no rumor, look at the crazy things that love made Jesus do
The friends he chose were thought to be outrageous
And you could even find him touching the contagious
And the craziest is how he chose to save us
He gave his life away
Then he had to go and say
""Gotta love the same way that I love you!""

Love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
The way he loves you and me
Ã???Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy

What the world needs now is for love to spread
As fast as the rumors do
But to make it, we gotta take this thing from another whole point of view
We can start by keeping our vows, and not breakin' promises
And bring hope to the women at the well, and the doubting Thomases
And you kids, you gotta cheerfully do what your pops and your mama says
He gave his life away
Then he had to go and say
""Gotta love the same way that I love you!""

Love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
We gotta love like crazy
The way he loves you and me
'Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy

Well I'm tellin' you boy, you got a lot to learn
I think you're crazy all right to love for nothin' in return
You've lost your marbles, got a few loose screws
And if you count your cards I'll bet you got less than fifty-two
But now you got me thinkin', you sorta planted a seed
'Cause you know this might be just the kind of love that I need
Naw, your train's off the track, you're from the loony bin
You know that brain that you ordered? Well it never came in
Or else you've fallen on your head and all your brains leaked out
'Cause your lights are on, but ain't nobody in your house
Your elevator doesn't quite reach the top floor
I think you're out in left field, and I could say a lot more
But you don't care what I think, it doesn't matter what I'm tellin' you
You got the love of Jesus, and he's the one compellin' you to love
Like he does
You gotta love like he does
You gotta love like he does
'Cause if the world's ever gonna change
We gotta love like crazy",Love Like Crazy
Chris Rice,"Wake up you sleepyhead sun
Rise from your eastern bed
Stretch and yawn, now it's time to shine
And chase our shadows west
Burn in your pathway across the sky
And brighten up our stories
Wake the continents and oceans to
Another blessed morning!

You are the gift, you are the proof
The Lord looks down and warms my roof
You are the light, you are the sign
That I am loved and life is mine

You even played a part
On history's saddest day
You closed your eyes and the world grew dark
While the Father hid His face
And then two more circles around the world
To weep and wait for glory
And then you rose to show the way
On Resurrection Morning!

You are the gift, you are the proof
The Lord looks down and warms my roof
You are the light, you are the sign
That I am loved and life is mine

Evening so quickly comes
You're ready to kiss the sea
Enhancing the colors of our skin
You cast our shadows east
Your blankets are fading, their purple glows
Your sleepy head is turning
And to our dreams we'll gladly go
And see you in the morning

And the girls are all staring her down

And my heart starts to pound

It all blurs and it all starts to zoom
And then my head starts spinning

She gets a few feet away
And suddenly we're both in slow motion
Like were alone in the deep blue ocean
I know it's just a feeling
But it might as well be real
Because I think I might be fixin' to drown

My knees go weak
And my heart starts to pound

She takes my hand
I don't know what to say
She understands anyway

And here come those eyes
'Can she what I'm think of?'
If this is what they call love
I can't believe I'm in it

Thanking heaven every minute

And I can't catch my breath

I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me

Apostle Peter
Taps me on the shoulder
Said son are you lost
I said can you show me around
I'll be bound to
Tell me what brings you to heaven today
I've always wondered what the fuss is all about
I feel like a kid flashin a fake id
Tryin to slip past the authority

Now I'm sneakin' into heaven
With a borrowed halo
Hopin' no one notices my broken wing
Peekin through these gates and thinkin lord have mercy
I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me

Hey Mr Pedro
I have a little confession
I don't belong here
And this halo isn't mine
Peter laughed
And said Lord happened to notice
We've all been broken
But now we'll do just fine
Cause nobody's good enough
But up here we're all the same
We all get to heaven
On someone else's name

Sneakin' into heaven
With a borrowed halo
Hopin' no one notices my broken wing
Peekin through these gates and thinkin lord have mercy
(2 times)
I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me
No, I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me
I'm never gonna make it if it's up to me
",Sneakin' into Heaven
Chris Rice,"The first thought through my sleepy head
When I fell outta my bed is I hope the sky is gray
I'm gonna write a sad song today
So I make up my mind, slip on my shoes
I'm gonna pick up a paper and read the news
'Cause I'm sure to find enough blues to write my sad song

But when I open the door and the sun spills through
Takes away my breath and I think of you
And the only blues to hit my eyes
Are those beautiful blues in the clear blue sky

So much for my sad song
So much for my sorry attitude
Let's make this a love song instead
'Cause I'm so in love with you

Come on, let's go out and play
Save the sad song for another day
No time for tears, I'm wearing a smile
So much for my sad song
So much for my sad song

So I pick up the news like I said I would
Drop my jaw right where I stood
'Cause the headline reads, ""All the news is good
Because love is on the way""

And love floods the world right before my eyes
Everybody is dancing and slapping hi fives
And such beautiful music fills the sky and we all sing along
And now I snap out of my daydream
And I can't believe how real it seems

But I keep on dancing anyway
It's turning out to be a beautiful day

Sometimes I measure my day
By how many things go my way
And when things go wrong I usually get mad
But this time I'm glad my song didn't turn out sad
",So Much for My Sad Song
Chris Rice,"Start with an infant world and an open sky
On a perfect day, breath from the mouth of God
Sends a quiver through His design of clay
And it is good, and it is good

Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again
Wake to a girl beside
Here's a hand to hold and never go away

Now taste the forbidden fruit
Make a poor excuse
Feel the wall of shame
And run and hide, and run and hide

Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again
Child in a manger bed
See the virgin smile, she understood

Now grow up and break your bread
Pour your cup of wine
On a cross of wood
A cross of wood, a cross of wood

Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again
Tell me the story again

Time twenty centuries
There's a boy on his knees
At the river's edge
Now plunge with his guilty stains
In the cleansing waves
And wash his sins away

Oh, happy day
Oh, happy day
Oh, happy day
Oh, happy day

Tell me that story again
Tell me that story again
Tell me the story, tell me the story
Tell me the story, tell me the story again

Start with an infant world
And an open sky on a perfect day
",Tell Me the Story Again
Chris Rice,"What A Heart Is Beating For (Lyrics)



By Chris Rice

Leave it alone, don't analyze
'Cause love can be your lullaby
But love can be your hurricane too
And love can take your breath away
But love can leave you lonely and blue
Oh, what's a heart to do?
Oh, what's a heart to do?

Why be afraid
No reason to hide
Take the chance
Put it all on the line
Draw in a deep breath and throw open the door
'Cause that's what a heart is beating for
Yeah, that's what a heart is beating for
Beating for, beating for

Brace yourselves, take a good look around
We've all been thinking upside-down
That love's about what life can bring our way
Oh but love isn't love unless someone pays
And so with love, the only way to gain
Is give it all away
Is give it all away!

Why be afraid
No reason to hide
Take the chance
Put it all on the line
Draw in a deep breath and throw open the door
'Cause that's what a heart is beating for
Yeah, that's what a heart is beating for
Beating for, beating for
",What a Heart Is Beating For
Chris Rice,"You're all smiles and silly conversation
As if this sunny day came just for you
You twist your hair, you smile, and you turn your eyes away
C'mon, tell me what's right with you
Now it dawns on me probably everybody's talkin'
And there's something here I'm supposed to realize
'Cause your secret's out, and the universe laughs at its joke on me
I just caught it in your eyes, it's a beautiful surprise

When did you fall in love with me?
Was it out of the blue
'Cause I swear I never knew it
When did you let your heart run free?
Have you been waiting long?
When did you fall in love with me?
When did you fall in love?

Make your way over here, sit down by this fool, and let's rewind
C'mon, let's go back and replay all our scenes
You can point out the hints, the clues, the twists and the smiles this time
All the ones that slipped by me
I bet my face is red, and you can hear my heart poundin'
Well I guess it don't matter now that I realize
'Cause baby I missed it then, but I can surely see you now
Right here before my eyes
You're my beautiful surprise

When did you fall in love with me?
Was it out of the blue
'Cause I swear I never knew it
When did you let your heart run free?
Have you been waiting long?
When did you fall in love with me?
When did you fall in love?

Was it at the coffee shop
Or that morning at the bus stop
When you almost slipped, and I caught your hand
Or the time we built the snowman
The day at the beach, sandy and warm
Or the night with the scary thunderstorm
I never saw the signs
Now we've got to make up for lost time
And I can tell now by the way that you're looking at me
I'd better finish this song so my lips will be free

Have you been waiting long, when did you fall in love
I kept you waiting so long, when did you fall
Have you been waiting long
When did you fall in love with me
When did you fall in love?",When Did You Fall [Acoustic Version][*]
Chris Rice,"So called reality right there on my TV
If that's how life's supposed to be
Well, somebody's lyin'
The camera's on and we can tell
To keep your fame you have to yell

'Cause tensions build and products sell
And we're all buyin'
I hope we're smarter than this

Everybody take a breath
Why are all your faces red?
We're missin' all the words you said
You don't have to yell

Draw your lines and choose your side
?Cause many things are worth the fight
But louder doesn't make you right
You don't have to yell, oh
You don't have to yell

I tuned in to hear the news
I don't want your point of view
If that's the best that you can do
Then something's missin'

And experts on whatever side
You plug your ears, you scream your lines
You claim to have an open mind
But nobody's listenin'
Don't you think we're smarter than this?

Everybody take a breath
Why are all your faces red
We're missin' all the words you said
You don't have to yell

You don't have to yell
You don't have to yell

Everybody take a breath
Why are all your faces red
We're missin' all the words you said
You don't have to yell

If everyone will take the step
Back away and count to ten

We won't have to yell

Many things are worth the fight
But louder doesn't make you right

Chris Richardson,"For you I'm putting up a fight
And it's crazy how I'm thinking 'bout you all the time
Tatt' my name on you, show me that you really mine
Stevie Wonder 'bout you how they say that love is blind
But I see it all and now I see no flaws
She walk, dress like a fashion show I just applaud
Got problems, I'll be the shoulder to lean on
Nobody perfect but you a angel with wings on
Chanel, Emon smile brighter than neon star
like no other, your team you the elite one
I dreamed of meeting you one day today it's gon' come
Smiley face with a tongue

Hey, just wanna say hey
Don't mean to be rude, no
Don't mean to think about you all night long
If it's a fight, if it's the last line
Just take the good times with the sorrow
Promise we'll be back tomorrow

Can you smile for me?
Show those pretty teeth
Blow my mind again, if you miss me
You can cry away
Touch my heart again
Let me feel your pain
Even if it's somewhere in between joy and pain (oh oh oh oh oh)
Joy and pain (oh oh oh oh oh)
Joy and pain (oh oh oh oh oh)
Even if it's somewhere in between joy and pain

Let's talk about us
'Cause even if we fuss or fight, little mama
I can't get enough
Tell me where you are
And where you've been
All I want is you to tell me you're happy again

Can you smile for me?
Show those pretty teeth
Blow my mind again
If you miss me
You can cry away
Touch my heart again
Let me feel your pain

I swear we'll get there
Tears are gone now I can see you smile again
Somewhere between pain and joy, girl's there's everything,
The best smile I've ever seen on, you!

Chris Roberts,"Letztes Wochenende fuhr ich ganz allein
Mit meinem Motorrad hinaus auf's Land.
Nach dem groáen Regenguá I'm Sonnenschein
Sah ich ein Mädchen stehn am Straáenrand.
Ihre Kleider klebten pitschnaá an ihr.
Ich sagte: do
Do
Do
Komm mit mir.
Dann suchte ich sofort am nächsten Ort ein Gasthaus aus
Da rief der dicke Wirt schon an der Tür:

Hier ist ein Zimmer frei
Klein und gemütlich
Und es reicht für zwei
Wer's einmal kennt
Der zieht nicht gern aus
Denn da fühlt man sich zuhaus.
Hier ist ein Zimmer frei
Ein gutes Frühstück ist umsonst dabei.
Und wer allein zu zwein darin wohnt
Der wird mit Liebe belohnt.
Und wir stiegen ab in diesem netten Haus
Dann schauten wir das kleine Zimmer an.
Endlich zogen wir die nassen Kleider aus
Weil man sich sonst so leicht erkälten kann.
So sah ich das Mädchen plötzlich vor mir stehn.
Und sagte: do
Do
Do
Do bist schön.
Ja und wir beide sahn am nächsten Morgen immer noch
Die Leute drauáen durch den Regen gehn.
Hier ist ein Zimmer frei
Klein und gemütlich
Und es reicht für zwei
.
Sonntag Abend fuhren wir vergnügt nach Haus
Und rollten langsam in die groáe Stadt.
Ja
Und dann hielt ich vor ihrer Haustür an
Wo sie I'm Dachgeschoá ein Zimmer hat.
Ich gab ihr die Hand
Da lachte sie mich an
Und sagte: do
Do
Do
Hör doch auf.
Do warst doch schon I'm kleinen Gasthaus ganz allein mit mir
Dann komm auch hier ein biáchen mit hinauf.
Hier ist ein Zimmer frei! Hier ist ein Zimmer frei
Ein gutes Frühstück ist umsonst dabei.
Und wer allein zu zwein darin wohnt
Der wird mit Liebe belohnt.

Chris Roberts,"Ich lieb' dich nun seit vielen Wochen
Doch frag' ich mich
Ob sich's lohnt.
Nachts I'm Park sitz ich neben dir
Und schau leider nur in den Mond.
Do sagst immer: Fall nicht gleich
Mit der Tür ins Haus!
Händchenhalten und Diskutieren
Das hält kein Mann lange aus:
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer
Rück noch ein Stück zu mir her!
Liebe
Die macht ja dein Leben schön
Komm her und dann wirst do es sehn:
Küssen ist gar nicht so schwer
Adam sprach: Eva
Komm her!
Wer einmal anfängt
Verlernt's nie mehr
Ja
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer!
In Romanen da liest do viel
über Männer und über Sex.
Bleib nicht nur bei der Theorie
Sonst kriegst do noch einen Komplex!
Stürz dich endlich mal mit mit
In's Vergnügen rein
Und ich schwör' dir
Nach drei Versuchen geht alles
Schon von allein:
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer
Rück noch ein Stück zu mir her
Liebe ist leichter noch als Latein
Man braucht sie
Um glücklich zu sein.
Küssen ist gar nicht so schwer
Adam sprach: Eva
Komm her!
VVer einmal anfängt
Verlernt's nie mehr
Ja
Liebe ist gar nicht so schwer!
Da hilft kein Lexikon
Kein Rat per Telefon
So ein Naturtalent wie do kann das I'm Nu.

Rück noch ein Stück zu mir her!
Alles wär' traurig
Dein Herz wär' schwer
Wenn heute die Liebe nicht wär'.

Set from the get-go, knew it was over before

You were just the ghost of a bad habit
Where is the blood, where is the passion?
I got lost on a bad reaction to you

Point dirty fingers, it's everybody's fault when
History lingers, history leaves little doubt
But gives me a treason, but I gave you the truth
You gave me reasons, a pitiful excuse

That I like to call my good
And see the mirror of my heart reflecting you

Are you pleased with me?
Am I everything you want for me to be?

The light fades in as the darkness dies
Sunlight, sweet sunlight brings the day that You’ve created
Perfect remedy for all that tears at me

Arise, arise with the morning
Arise, Your mercies are new
Arise, arise with the morning
That finds me running back to You

Darkness comes and covers all my faults
Tears fall down and sting my wounds like salt
Hopes fade till I’m caught in the day that You’ve created
Perfect remedy for all that tears at me

Arise, arise with the morning
Arise, Your mercies are new
Arise, arise with the morning
That finds me running back to You

I’m anxiously waiting
Redemption is brimming with the stories created
Each new day I know You are coming

Don’t wanna hang my heart on my sleeve
But You’re everything my soul could ever need
I don’t wanna cry tonight

Just a little faith gets us further in this race
We all know trust don’t come too easily
Is this just romance
Or will we take a chance on something beautiful?

I don’t wanna cry tonight
Don’t wanna hang my heart on my sleeve
But You’re everything my soul could ever need
I don’t wanna cry tonight

Don’t wanna know my heart’s broke in two
‘Cause all I'll ever need right here is You

And how fast my heart could change

Empty me of the selfishness inside
Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride
And any foolish thing my heart holds to

To know how prodigals can be drawn away
I know how I can stray

Someday when my dreams are caving in I will let you
Know
I'll let you know

At least until you fall.

Stratospheres and atmospheres collide,
Worlds come to an end
And there's nowhere left to hide.

Waiting for the right time to let this go
I know I’m not the only one who feels this
Hears this, is it a near miss?
'Cause I think it’s finally time to let my feelings show

Are good intentions as far as I can go?

Kind words, just a bullet in a chamber
Big talk but nothing’s ever changing
Take aim but never making my mark
Love can change the world
But it’s gotta start with my heart

Love is a gift of one and it’s all I can’t buy
But I’m looking for a reason I can give it now
Every single mother’s son reaches out for love from, someone
And I hold the key to breaking through the doubt

Are good intentions as far as I can go?

Kind words, just a bullet in a chamber
Big talk but nothing’s ever changing
Take aim but never making my mark

Shake, shake, can you hear the sound?
Move, move, do you feel it now?
Love, love, love is raining down

While all the joy you give instead becomes engaging
Was shallow love given up too late?

Burning dreams of anticipation
10 years on and we’re still trying to figure out
What to be when we grow up

We’re almost 30, still getting it together
Getting desperate, is this gonna take forever?

Oh, does everybody feel this way
Getting old but never growing up?
Oh, is there a destination waiting for me
Where I can finally meet, the man I’m meant to be?

We are young, with hopes that fade with ages
Life is full of empty pages
We’re like a river, twisting and turning
But never finds the open sea

Oh, is there a destination waiting for me
Where I can finally meet, the man I’m meant to be?

I need someone to show me, where could I begin

About the way You don’t make sense
A crown for a cross, heaven for earth
Beauty for ashes in the dirt

There’s something marvelous
Some kind of mystery in Your grace

Still we find beauty in the cross
And hope from what was lost

Though I can’t wrap my mind around the mysteries I’ll be fine
There’s something beautiful in all I can’t see through

There’s something wonderful
About the way You break my heart
This world for a cross, riches for shame
Trading this glory for Your name
And success for lovely gain

A living monument opposed to my success

Sweat beading on his skin, his clothes and hair a mess

Do I want to hear the stories I see echoed in their eyes?
Or is this love I say that I'm reflecting even real?

Lose these blues and screw your head on tight again
She cut you bad, your heart is just a scar
But if you could just get mad, you'd be better off by far
What you want is taken
What you need is better circulation
Work that heavy heart and get it light again

Listen to me now
You suffer from a sadness, apprehension
That if she could read your mind she'd see just how it ought to be
But she's read it all by now
And your style don't get a grip on her attention
She ain't in your state of mind and she don't want to be
You think if she'd just talk, you could explain it all
She'd be polite, but all night she's been hoping you won't call
She'll it's all her fault, she'll always be your friend
Plus loads of shit too dumb to mention
I've been that road and it's paved with good intentions

Well it's hard to believe
But I'm telling you your heart would soon recover
But you don't want it to, you love this aching agony
'Cause it's noble, but it's true
You won't forsake this pain for other lovers
Happiness would fill your mind with misery
Time will wound all heels, and it ain't pretty
With any luck at all, she'll find some dope that you can pity
Your loss is measured in illusions
And your gain is all in bittersweet intelligence
And your winsome smile will lose some of its innocence
Your winsome smile
Your winsome smile will lose some of its innocence",Winsome Smile
Chris Smither,"Climb into this car,
I will take you for a ride,
We won't go very far,
But I think better here inside,
Somethin' I forgot to tell you,
Think it over, then decide.

I will make this explanation,
If you can't see it for yourself,
It's very hard to pay attention,
When you listen someplace else,
Turn off that radio,
It's like I'm talkin' to myself.

These are not petty pleasures,
It's a dance that slowly glides,
In very complicated measures,
That can't be simplified,
But if we just keep this together,
All the rest is justified.

Every step is destination,
Every moment is as long,
As it will take imagination,
To begin and end the song,
Part equals all, that's creation,
That's the sense that we belong.

It ain't easy bein' careful,
I know it's hard to take your time,
But if we think for one another,
Mine is yours, yours is mine,
Lose your sense of separation,
All the rest will fall in line.

Please believe me when I tell you,
The hardest part is to begin,
I know you think I'm crazy,
But we're halfway to the end,
And if I drive you to distraction,
I will drive you home again.",Drive You Home Again
Chris Smither,"Lemme tell ya 'bout Linda Lou,
She had a big head,
She slept with her hat on,
She had a big butt too,
She kept me whole with a big heart,
She went away, I fell apart,
I'm all alone, 
Yeah, I'm on my own.

Lemme tell ya 'bout Betty Jean,
She had a filthy mind, 
She worked at the car wash,
But she could not come clean,
Long as I live I'm gonna love her to death,
She said she'd be back, I don't hold my breath,
I'm all alone,
Yeah, I'm on my own.

[Chorus]

I don't know why,
They get a look in their eye,
And they leave me,
They think I don't know
What's goin' on,
But believe me, I know they're gone.

Lemme tell ya 'bout Billie Ray,
She told me she needed a man,
Money's nothin',
But that's all she'd say.
I couldn't get her to say I do,
Now she's gone, the money too,
I'm all alone.
Yeah I'm on my own.

I'm gonna get me a better one,
One with one name,
Who comes when I call her,
We'll have a lot of fun,
Be glad to see me when I get home,
Wag her tail when I bring her bones,
I ain't alone,
Never on my own.

We'll stick together,

Chris Smither,"I am not a prophet,
I wouldn't be one if you paid me,
But it doesn't take a lot to see ,
Just where you're headed lately,
Pretty soon you're gonna ask me,
How come the life you lead, 
Doesn't make you very happy,
Or satisfy your needs,
You talk about your needs as though
You know just what they are,
When in fact to really know them,
Is like traveling to a star,
It takes so long you die along the way,
So I say hey, hey, hey.

C'mon, siddown,
Let's talk about illusion,
How everything is made of it,
No wonder life's confusin',
All this stuff we take for granted,
So solid to the touch,
Is just a concrete indication,
That we love ourselves too much,
But if we don't love ourselves, you say,
Who will? Whatever for?
I say, that's a better question
Than the one you asked before,
But the answer is still just as far away,
So I say hey, hey, hey.

Let go of all of this,
Forget about your reason, 
You can leave it all behind you,
You can start another season,
All these silly little fictions,
Are gonna take you by surprise,
When you see them in the daylight
And finally realize,
You told them to yourself,
Nobody else was listening,
You'll be standing broken-hearted,
Like a disillusioned Christian,
With your mouth open but nothin' left to say,
So just say hey, hey, hey.","Hey, Hey, Hey"
Chris Smither,"I remember one Columbus Day,
When I was young and learned the world was round,
There didn't seem to be a lot to say, 
But I had trouble keepin' both feet on the ground.
But now I stick to you,
I know just what to do,
I hold on.

I remember looking at the sky,
So thick and blue that I went tumblin' in,
Out the window, knowin' I could fly,
I flew as far as where the ground begins,
For you I'll use the door,
I don't do that anymore, 
I hold on.

[Chorus]
All the black and blue,
That I stumble through for you
Will never show.
I have a simulated grace
To help me keep my place,
And never let you go..
I'll never let you go

If you could see the world the way I do,
With nothing keepin' up or keepin' time,
Your sense of self would tear your heart in two,
While you try to tell the world you're feelin fine,
Inside that's how I feel,
So I reach for something real, 
And hold on.

Chris Smither,"I don't know much, when I knew less,
And I was heartbroke for the first time,
I was drowning in my tears,
I went looking for a lifeline,
Trying to find some comfort,
A simple tender touch,
Searching for some little cure
That would not cost too much,
And I could hear that produce wagon on the street,
I could hear that farmer singing,
As I cried myself to sleep

I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound,
Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town,
I got okra, enough to choke ya,
Beans of every kind,
If hungry is what's eatin' you
I'll sell you peace of mind,
But this ain't what you came to hear me say,
And I hate to disappoint you,
But I got no love today,
I got no love today,
I got no love today,
No love today

I could not love to save myself
From lonesome desperation.
Everything I thought was love 
Was worthless imitation.
My concept of commitment
Was to take all you could give,
I thought the cheapest thrills I loved
Were teachin' me to live,
But nothin' seemed to last or see me through
Nothin' but that little song 
That I still sing for you.

I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound,
Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town,
I got okra, enough to choke ya,
Beans of every kind,
If hungry is what's eatin' you
I'll sell you peace of mind,
But this ain't what you came to hear me say,
And I hate to disappoint you,
But I got no love today,
I got no love today,
I got no love today,
No love today

No love today, none tomorrow,
Not now, not forever.
You can't see what comes for free,
I think you much too clever,
For your own good I will tell you
What's right before your eyes,
Intelligence is no defense 
Against what this implies,
In the end no one will sell you what you need,
You can't buy it off the shelf,
You got to grow it from the seed,

I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound,
Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town,
I got okra, enough to choke ya,

Chris Smither,"To see me now you would never think to wonder,
How near we were to sinkin' under,
For so long,

So long.

The truth be told, I think my soul was stuck in amber,
Like a chip for weary gamblers,
For so long.
But now I'm gone,
So long.

See me, I'm a sailor now,
Sail on, sail on,
Dark skies seem paler now,

Tell me how you know,

'Cause I can hear 'em laughin',
I can hear 'em singin'
I can hear 'em dancin' down in San Antonio,
They don't have these questions,
And almost without exception,
They don't care if they don't ever know,
They got a Texas moon above 'em,
Texas men to love 'em,
All they seem to care about is how they feel tonight,
I've lived that way before,
But I can't do it anymore,
Just because it isn't wrong don't make it right.

So tell me why you love me,
Tell me how you know,
I know it might be so,
But I might never know,
And I will not believe you 'till you tell me.
And if you won't tell me, I got to go.

Well I can tell you why I love you,
You know I hardly have to try,
It came to me while I 
Was thinking over your reply,
Instead of simply takin' me for granted,
you took me by surprise and asked me why,

'Cause I used to say I love you,
They would say I love you too,
And all it really meant was ""ain't this fun? Yes I agree""
It was just a way of talkin',
They might just as well be walkin'
With the dog instead of comin' home with me.
Everything had to be cheerful,
And I'd really get an earful,
If I ever tried to talk about what mattered most to me,
It was a major undertaking,
Just to keep their hearts from breaking,
Every time I tried to sing in minor key.

Was thinking over your reply,-a",Tell Me Why You Love Me

Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight

Smokes big cigars
She drives big cars around
Folks say she's gonna reach the top
But she says that's just her first stop

I know she ain't a good 'un
Whatcha bet she wouln' lose much sleep
If I should die today
She says the love ain't cheap, but the pain is free
And I say, 'But that sounds good to me!
She's got hooks to make a fish think twice
But I ain't no fish
I'll pay any price
If I think at all, I think, 'This feels nice!

Lookin' for my Lola, what if I'd 'a told ya
She don't even know she hurts me so
She says 'I don't hate you, it ain't that big a deal
You don't even figure in the way I feel' but
Don't think she feels too much at all

I said 'Have a heart', she told me to my face
'What little heart I got is in the wrong place.'

Lookin' for my Lola, she's a little rock 'n roller
Party down, paint the town again
She drinks too much, she keeps it hid
Everybody says she's a hell of a kid
But she ain't no kid when she's cuttin' me apart
That's OK, I told her from the start
'Don't stop 'fore you get my heart'

Lookin' for my Lola, I barely got to know ya
For all I know, there ain't a lot to know

Chris Smither,"Did you ever stop to notice
It's when you feel a little low
That the entire spinning universe
Descends to say hello
With heavy-handed cheerfulness
And a calculated smile and says
'Carry me awhile'
But you don't have to carry
Much of anything at all
The biggest thoughts of bigger things
Are really pretty small
The major thoughts that occupy the minor state of mind
Are what we leave behind
Just a minor thought that we can leave behind

Don't worry 'bout the future, you can't afford the price
There's madness to the method when you pay the piper
Twice once when you start to worry
Once again when you begin to take the future on the
Chin I know that you think worry is your ever-faithful
Friend cuz nothin' that you worry over ever happens in the
End and there might be somethin' to it
But it sure gets in the way of fun today
What you say we try and have some fun today

It takes a sense of balance on this tiny little ball
With a tiny mind still big enought to think about it all
To realize the size of things is just a state of mind
And you can change your mind
There's a riddle in the middle of that univeral spin
But we're out here on the edges where it gets a little thin
So just for once permit yourself a carefree little grin

Cuz we're out here on the outside lookin' in

You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I cant hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.",Comfortably Numb [*]
Chris Squire,"Feels like the end
When you're closer to losing your dreams
Than losing a friend
Flying blind
I'm shooting into the dark
Who will I find?
Oh girl
And if it takes me a lifetime
I swear I'll tear down every wall
Love conquers all

On my way
Tomorrow I rise with the sun
Soon I'll be gone
Words can't say
How the memories of feelings of love
They linger on
Oh girl
And if it takes me forever
I know it's worth every teardrop that falls
Love conquers all

Somewhere there's a place in your heart
Where the wounds never heal
Well you're not alone
That's just how I feel

Love conquers all
This one will last a lifetime
And if love conquers all
This one will last forever",Love Conquers All

Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been?

Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there

Chris Standring,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As
Chris Stapleton,"I put that record on
Girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again

You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars

Or is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'

Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to?

That you're just like me

Is it a feel good song gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving on pass to pass
Or the kind you can’t help singing along
Singing whoa

Is it headphones on on a downtown train
Or a window seat on an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny and Memphis blue
I wish I knew I wish I knew

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars

Chris Stapleton,"I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

I miss my son
And I miss my wife

Chris Stapleton,"Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty five or was it twenty six
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth havin', I'd just lose anyway
Friends worried about me they'd asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn't die at twenty five or was it twenty six

Melted into memories like somebody else's life

Et jeter son manteau sur toi

A digérer, qui n'en a pas

Il y a un temps pour les sortir
Il y a un temps où ils sont froids

Tu penses que tu en connais mille
Et sans bouger tu restes là

Chris Swicegood,"A simple man born long ago in 1915
Whose hands were meant to play the 6-string
A harmonica was all that Les could afford
This young mans life started out by this accord

94 years young and so much he gave
A sound forever his own it was
A life well played

One autumn night we met after his set
He was a wry and witty old man in downtown NY
""I'll sign your 6-string young man"" 
I can still see him smile 
As he signed his name across my guitar
His gift was a part of his fame

94 years young  so much he gave
A sound forever his own it was
A life well played

He passed away quietly in August 2009
My thoughts turned towards the night 
When he was so kind
His hands so worn so tired now finally at rest

She kissed all her friends goodbye and she rowed away
Rain came down on Kingston, we stood silent
She will reach the sea in a couple of days

Will you keep the picture safe?
We will keep the picture safe

I went climbing mountains, high above the city
Looking at the river stretched out like a map below
All her friends were scattered to the corners
Nobody understood why she had to go

I will get my story straight
We will keep the picture safe

On the evening news a mother drowned her baby
As I sat there, I knew who to blame
Halfway down Embankment, hope was fading
Truth is nothing, will ever be the same

I will never see her again
We couldn't keep the picture safe

Watch the picture float away

I'll drag them back to the field they should be dead by then
Wipe the sweat off my neck and tally ho the plow

And there's room on your dress for a corsage
And I'll open up every door for you
I opened up my almanac and in my head I read
Cut your wrist on the fins of the fish and drain all you can
So I rolled up my sleeves and then began to draw lines just as deep as the days are long


I sewed up my wrist and sewed the ground with my blood
Staind up my clothes pretty good and I turned that dirt to mud
I couldn't help but close my eyes and lay my body down

Creation revealing Your majesty
From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring

You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
You are amazing God
All powerful, untameable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom

Indescribable, uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name
You are amazing God
All powerful, untameable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God

Chris Tomlin,"Oh Jesus, son of God, so full of grace and truth
The Father's saving word, so wonderful are You
The angels longed to see and prophets searched to find
The glory we have seen revealed

You shone upon the Earth but who will understand?
You came unto Your own but who will recognize?
Your birth was prophesied, for You were the Messiah
Who came and walked upon the Earth

In You all things were made and nothing without You
In Heaven and on Earth all things are held in You

Chris Tomlin,"O holy night,
The stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of
Our dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining,
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees,
O hear the angel voices!
O night divine,
O night when Christ was born!
O night divine, O night,
O night divine!

Led by the light of Faith
Serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star
Sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus
In lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend!
He knows our need,
To our weakness no stranger;
Behold your King!
Before the lowly bend!
Behold your King! your King!
Before Him bend.

Truly He taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise His holy name!
Christ is the Lord,
Oh praise His name forever,
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
His pow'r and glory
Evermore proclaim.","O, Holy Night"

Chris Tomlin,"Come Thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing 
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

How Your kindness yet pursues me
How Your mercy never fails me
Till the day that death shall loose me
I will sing, oh I will sing 
Turnaround

Oh to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart Lord, take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

The Light of all the world
With the world on His shoulders

The weight of all our shame
On Him who knew no sin

The Father looked away

By His blood I've been redeemed

And there His body lay

When I have a mind so caught in the grime
Bewildered months reach me

Chris Velan,"It was the year of our father
Nineteen-hundred and seventy-six in JA
When I first met my Mary, quite contrary to what
My mother did say
She was a mountain girl come to Spanish Town
I was only there for a while
But when I think back on all the love we shared
I just can't but help to smile
We spent one whole long year together
And at the end, I had to go
By my Mary's side, I wept and cried
I'd never been laid so low
She said, Boy when you first met me
You were as green as a mango tree
Hmm, but now you are a man, go back to your land
But first listen carefully 
You can smoke two pounds of Cali herb by yourself then
Try to stand on your head
No matter how high you get, you'll never forget
The wonders of Mary's bed

Now my Mary's sweet smell was in my nose
And her vision, it robbed me blind
And as I crossed the sea, it occurred to me
That I left myself behind
She was my natural mystic, sweet sugarplum
I still ask, why did I go
They say your first love is your hardest love
And I'd have to say that's so
And it's a day and another day and a way and another way
Had a family once but they're gone
Now it don't strike me as weird, there's grey in my beard
But her words still linger on

Now there's nothing for me left here 'cept some broken dreams
Disappointments, I've had a few
But there's this place I know where the mangroves grow
And there's just one thing left to do
I'll go back to my Mary's bed, plant a kiss on her head
And pretend that time just stood still
Then I can live out my life like it should have been
And the rest will be what it will
So I went back to the bar where we first met
Asked the bartender, where could she be
And as he poured me a beer, he said, last year
She left this world peacefully
Then every man in the bar looked at me
They said, old man don't you see
That we were all touched by Mary just like you
Now she lives on in our memories 
And we all can smoke two pounds of Cali herb by ourselves then
Try to stand on our heads
No matter how high we get, we'll never forget
The wonders of Mary's bed
And we can run two hundred miles through a ganja field until
All we see is red
And we can shout it out, were still thinking about
The wonders of Mary's bed
And so we sing, jump around sweet Mary
You know we all have to move along
You never know what you've got in this cruel world
Until you realize it's gone.",Sweet Mary
Chris Volz,"I've heard for many years how you have died for me
And if I'd just believe it
Then I could spend my life with you
But all the repetition found me on my own
Fighting for my freedom
A chance to prove myself alone
But now I see I've needed you

All my life
I needed someone to care for me
A love that would always be there for me
No matter how hard it might prove to be
All my life
Now I am willing to live for you
Sacrifice all if you want me to
I'm sure you know how much I'd love to share

I guess when I was younger, just a fool at heart
No one else could tell me
The answer for this life of mine

Growing deep inside me
No longer did I want to live alone
Then I remembered you

Toothless, hopeful, about to explode 

How could I have ever been so lucky

Brightening an otherwise crumbling place

All the tears and the smiles shed for me
She'd disappear to the world around me
Everything to be a powerful memory
(so I could carry all that we'd been with me)

So I brought her to the swamp she loved so well
Where I gently placed her in it
I brought her soul to ease with kisses
And I said to her as I's about to begin it

Don't cry
Don't feel
You won't die
Because I don't think death's real
It's good
It's mine
And it should be
At your heels all of the time

In a place I did not recognize.
He was filling up a clear plastic box with colored candy, colored nuts...
All sold by the weight.Ã¢??

So shut the door and shut off the light

I'll be late

I got upset.
So don't stay up and wait

The painting didn't end up in the show, he told me later 
It was because the teacher said it wasn't good at all.
We were pretending this in the lobby earlier..
But I don't play bass!

Keep the time, keep the time
The hardest part is letting go, whoa

Chris Walla,"I was busy, I was occupied
I was burning the fields
A wind of black was blowing over me
And when the cilia revealed

All the ash lining my lungs
I heard a song, I heard a whispering
I gave my torch to the flame
I counted out the numbers silently

A list of places and names
That I'd best get back to, at least
Were I soon to find leave or release?
To sing again, now and then, now at least

On to death and on to dignity
On to flowering the grave
On to faith and on to piety
On to sending away

All the tools our dynasty yields
All these papers and axles and wheels
On to quiet, on to silence
On to still

It's not unsustainable

So don't even try to explain me away
We can make it, love
We can bend at the knee, we can fall
And still we can recover

It's not unsustainable
Don't say it
It's not unsustainable

",It's Unsustainable
Chris Walla,"You've got the pen
And we've done the typing
Why can't you get us all for good?
Let's put it in writing

On and on we argue so
Sirens blare and the whistles blow
'Til we cannot hear anymore
This is the score, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We've found the bear
Or are we both fighting?
Why do we prance our little flag around
As if he's not biting?

On and on we bled so long
Now the bodies rise and our limbs are gone
And we cannot swim anymore
This is the score, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now I'm a chase
My colors are falling
Two nations were removed
From where the resistance is calling

On and on we're fractured now
They're bound to ship those children out
And on and on, no end in sight, now enjoy them
Don't wait for any call for me to see
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is the score

",The Score
Chris Walla,"It was not tricky to enjoy
A cigarette in hand was the key to understanding
To seek out and to destroy
The mindless oversights, a string of faithless nights

We sing again
Sing together with quiet eyes
I'd lower my chin to my chest
I thought that would be best

Another pattern of the bricks
Bundles of cells dividing and South Dakota driving
The very darkest, dirty tricks
If we still cared at all we'd send a battle call

We sing again
Sing together with fiery eyes
A rangle alive in our chests
No, this is not a test

Let's sing again
Sing together without disguise
Let's raise up a song in unrest
I think that would be best

Here's to poison
You will hear the noises
You will feel the breaking
It's all yours for the taking

A life packed full of mindless joy
And it's not easy to enjoy, oh

",Sing Again
Chris Walla,"St. Modesto
You were the ground line humming
You were the thread of fire upon this night

You could feel the living
You staggered and blew your money
A summery tailwind there upon our heels
Ooh, me and you, me and you

Down the valley
You'd drag me along for measure
The boredom was deafening at any speed

Still I could hear your breathing
You were as loud as the engine's gravel
Winding through Altamont, towards the sea
Ooh, you and me

If you're the one who can save this broken wreck
Then this is the end, we'll be through soon I suspect
Don't argue, these are facts

San Francisco
Eighty and four miles later
We were the vapor trails among the hills

There above us
An antenna of God, a broadcast
The table of contents right down through the trees
We were the pixels on the fallen leaves, oh, what do we do?

Are you the one
Who can save this gory mess?
I know you're a friend
You've been right and true I guess, I guess

I know you'd take one on the chin
You'd take it in the teeth for me
We are a team, but we are untied

I'm sinking with the weight of all the things I cannot do
But when I'm losing it, when I'm losing it
I know you're losing it too

St. Modesto
You were the guitar I'm strumming
You were the power cord that made the light

Chris Webby,"I’m a walking bad habit, E tabs up in the cabinet
Savage rap status: vocabulary extravagant
A rock star poppin’ rotches in bars
Used to flip bud now just rappin’ cop me a car
No tellin’, Connecticut felon, I GPS ‘em
And find my mark like Magellan with more lines than Corey Feldman
I never cease to impress ‘em
I cardiac arrest ‘em
With every studio session I'm killin' ‘em, no question
Webb’s back, better hold your breath when I’m rhyming homes
I murder beats, I’m Jonah Hex on the microphone
Fiends saying I’m the dopest yet
And haters? I shrug ‘em off until my fucking shoulders sweat
I’m breaking bones, a modern version of Casey Jones
Scored a hand, I’m the winner playing the Game of Thrones
Fuck beef, my rapping style’s filet mignon
Gettin’ drunk, fuck yo’ driver, somebody take me home

(Take me home)
Take me home now bitch

I know that I should change, but I don’t really think I can
It’s just part of my nature – I never cracked, I never ran
The world was falling on me when my back was in a jam
I always kept on fighting, that’s exactly who I am
And this is who I am, no way that I can change it
I’m buckwild, stupid, and dangerous
My best friends are not strangers
These are the motherfuckers I hang with
We speak the same language
And I ain’t saying French, English, or Spanish, or Spanglish
I mean pain and anguish, this cocaine slangin’ bang-bang shit
MAC-11s that we aim with
In other words, I’m rolling with the same clique I came with
I’m the sameness and fuck being famous
Fame dreams are for groupies
I’m a real-life gangster that you ain’t seen in the movies
What I mean is I’m truly off the hook
Like a phone in a nursing home, homie I’m that Boston crook

Take me home now bitch

(Take me home)
Eyes on the road, take me home now bitch

I damage tracks, so listeners always ran it back
Always with a half-ounce stuffed into a sandwich bag
I kill it quickly and always keeping the realest with me
Stealing all the fucking insulin from Wilford Brimley
“Diabetes,” rappers could never beat us
I been spittin’ shit like this since I was just a fuckin’ fetus
Keep your chick with me as long as she give dome
Rollin’ up the Diesel, I’m burning like Jim Rome
Bitch!

Yeah, standin’ here’s a man with the past, the inspiration
For the kids on the corner, but still got the laugh of a mental patient
The infiltration of the game
Born from a central hatred of fame
A pencil shaking with pain
An injured stake in the claim from the wrath I became
My paragaphs’ insane: they're futuristic pictures of the past from which I came
And this is Slaine with a shotty in the hooptie son
My whole career’s a robbery that they could never scoop me from

Now my name is hot so they be acting like they know
And they leading my right through those velvet ropes
Now I got them saying, aww naww, who the hell let Webby in
Aww naww, who the hell let Webby in

It's time to get it started mother fucker, let the games begin

I swear, shades on tint, never seeing through my eye-wear
No button down but I'm sleeved up, so many shows and I fly there
And my fans be getting them tickets quicker than pissing in public in Times Square
That nightmare on your street, stay with the hash like corned beef
And I light it up and I breathe it and my blunt be full of that four leaf
We killing this and I'm on my grind, running shit I got sore feet
24 deep on my tour bus, rolling right out to the floor seats
I'm blowing up what are you doing, sitting at home and YouTubing
Hating on me from a laptop, but these type of people I'm used to em
You ain't doing shit but smoking weed, watching porn, got no degree
You're a disappointment and blame everybody else that you never got where you hoped to be
See I worked for it, you sat back, I grinded out while you relaxed
And now you like; ""Fuck Webby man, yo, I should be where he's at, wait is that him, did he just cut the line, wait where's Denise at?""

Drinking this gin they be calling me Qui-Gon
Started out in that small time, mixtapes in the trunk of the car that I was driving in
That Altima, with back bumper hanging off the side, people honking at me (get off the road!)
Getting pulled over so often I'd have my registration at all times, 
Hanging out my window like
Sorry guy, I know I was speeding, I'm fucking high, 
But my plates are good and I'm fucking dry
Smoked all my weed on my way down here, we ain't got no charges? Fuck you, bye
Peel off in that shit box, so kick rocks, I'm out of here
Then head back to my parents house and get drunk until I run out of beer
But that was then, now I'm living differently
The clubs that would always turn me away, now they all let me in for free
The girls that used to blow me off, now they all on their friggin' knees
Still blowing me off, only difference? Now it's literally

Yea

[Chorus]
'Cause we came to get down right, yea
Eyes low from the weed we roll and I'm in my zone
Cause we came to get down right, yea
Ride slow, with the bass up mo', till the speakers blow
'Cause we came to get down right
Damn right, sloppy sloppy drunk
And we came to get down right
Damn right, green up in my blunt
This what it sounds like (x2)
I don't know about you, but I came to get down right",Down Right

I be living in the left lane
Passing y'all by
Sun roof rolling back, speakers up high
I be living in the left lane
Closing my eyes, watch the world from the third person inside
I be living in the left lane
Never looking back with my foot up on the gas, ain't got no time to react
I be living in the left lane
Moving too fast, I'm just trying not to crash, it could all end in a flash
When you be living in the left lane

Fast money, fast women, fast cars, doing donuts in the back-yard
Middle fingers up like a rap star, telling me I go too hard
Shots all lined up on the God damn bar, with a chick so bad she dropping jaws
And I'm dropping trou and I hit that raw, yeah
Live this way till I lose my mind, me I'm doing fine
Fucking monster call me Frankenstein and Dracula combined
On my grind, in my verbal prime, still Optimus Rhyme
Got Griselda Blanco coke and no one fucking with these lines
'Cause uh, all this shit is apart of my job, the parties the woman
The liquor the music, living a life you could only imagine
Put it in words and I give it to you, kids
But I told them, please don't try this at home, you really will lose it
So don't blame me if my listeners do it (let's go)

[Chorus]
I be living in the left lane
Passing y'all by

Never looking back with my foot up on the gas, ain't got no time to react
I be living in the left lane
Moving too fast, I'm just trying not to crash, it could all end in a flash
When you be living in the left lane

Let me carefully win, they callin' me Jeremy Lin, never stare at the rim
If you going to give me the rock I'm gonna dribble and carry it in, no comparing to him
Up on the road everyday, chugging a bottle of gin, contacts lens, 20/20
But you can't see them from under my brim, do it again ('gain)
Beast mode, Kung-fu, trees rolled, shit I'm here to rap
And if you're not I'd check that ego, try to keep it peaceful
But if they be coming at me bro
I'm rolling up in a tank, like I got Grand Theft Auto cheat codes
A mix of Mick Jagger and Morrison on tour again, pushing the fucking limits till I'm in the crematorium
'Cause when a star goes out it does so in a blaze of glory, then Mr. Harry Fraud will just bring the chorus in

Chris Webby,"I got the game on lockdown, ridin' with the top down, and I'm feeling so good
Baby we'll be headed to the top now cause it's the only way to go

Yeah, I'm on a roll now, traveling all around the globe
Only my booking agent know where I'm about to go
With a pretty young thing and an ounce to roll
Live that rockstar life call me Aldous Snow, uh
Feeling great, filet mignon on my plate
But I'm always staying hungry, you can see it on my face
You can see it in my eyes, I'mma win this race
Pulling through the finish line, like Brink on skates
And I'm feeling spectacular, still an eligible bachelor
It's so lovely, french kissing models with some molly on my tongue
In a different city every night like I was on the run
We gone, we gone, shout to everyone who supports me
Legal troubles over with, no more going to court, B
Now I'm chilling with a Vicky and a Courtney, top down, warp speed

[Chorus]
I always told them ""I will never stop"" now, look at what I got now
Always knew that I would, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go
Now I got the game on lock-down, riding with the top down
And I'm feeling so good, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go

I been out to sea, had to send an SOS
But I made it back to shore and I'm next on deck
Always got a little sexy brunette on text
Saying ""I'll see you when you back in town xox""
I've been slept on like futons, looked over like typos
Now you see my fucking name up in the lights, yo
Always been the under dog call me Fido
But I know, and always knew that I would win the fight bro
Either that or I'm going to go down swinging
Never back down if we gotta throw down, bring it
But still we having fun, strip club, pile of ones
And act a jackass, R.I.P Ryan Dunn
Shout to Sap always killing a track
We just some kids making money, what's the matter with that
And until I get a Grammy I'll be doing just dandy
The black sheep's now the bread winner of the family

[Chorus]
I always told them ""I will never stop"" now, look at what I got now
Always knew that I would, baby, and we headed to the top now

And I'm feeling so good, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go

Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go

I only think about it when I'm looking back
To the kid I used to be writing lyrics during class
Back when I had nothing but ambition and a dream
And a composition notebook full of rhyme schemes
I mean, I was a fuck up, but then I grew the fuck up
And gave it everything while I was working on my come up
And now I came up and baby I won't stop till I'm done
So now I'm yelling at the top of my lungs (Let's go!)

[Chorus]
I always told them ""I will never stop"" now, look at what I got now
Always knew that I would, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go
Now I got the game on lock-down, riding with the top down
And I'm feeling so good, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go

Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go

Yeah, I'm feeling good right now, man
All these years of hard work are finally paying off
There's really only one direction to go now
And that's up, so ya'll coming with me or what",Only Way to Go

It's that evil rap nemesis, putting together sentences
Let it be said a bit with the excellent rhetoric

Verbally a double barrel shotty, leave you blown apart
It's that evil rap nemesis, putting together sentences
Started off small, now I do it for the masses
It's that evil rap, evil rap, rap rap nemesis, putting together sentence

It's that evil rap nemesis second coming of Hendrix
Breaking laws, flipping off Officer Friendly, bitch
I'm a Jedi in the booth, with the power of phantom menaces
Light saber swinging, chopping off your appendages
Generously applying the dopest of rhyming
Open your eyes and see the headlights running over you driving
Over and over and over it on the road that I'm riding
You better open your mind or I'll do it for you (alright)
I'm just a mother fucking psychotic, neurotic, embodiment
Of everything your parents told you not to be probably
Taking shots out the bottle and now Alcoholics Anonymous
Smoking White Rhinoceros with Zach Galifinakis
Dropping hits of acid while rapping that's multi-tasking a lot of shit
Practicing karate kicks on people back in the audience
Popping Klonopin, obviously, shots'll be honestly
You, pull me out the party, I'm the shit ain't no stopping me dude

The Governor up out The Walking Dead I'm at your head with an axe
And you mother fuckers better get the cameras ready for action
So listen up, Webby is rapping and Semi is scratching
Shit is bound to cause a deadly reaction
Step to Webby motherfucker you gonna see how unfair feels, repping Fairfield to Norwalk
So damn, real, and you know I stay with the trees like Bear Grylls
Jimmy Hoffa the fucking beat and leave them in landfills
I just stand still, back in the building, spit this shit so cold
You can feel it in your cavity filling
I'm just trying to get some money till it stack to the ceiling
With all these motherfucking tracks that I'm killing
Well you know I got my Super Mario star, I'm untouchable
Fucking Clair Huxtable making her put an oven full of brownies with the hash oil
Then we cook them up until I toss them in my tummy and my brain is dysfunctional

Chris Webby,"See now my cup is full, my vibe is boosted
My fate is undecided, but it's going down the way that I choose it
Living life up on the stage and it's like I'm on display
And the fans coming through when they know every word to the songs that I fucking play
Bang the speakers out plus tears are leaking out
Girls in the crowd are freaking out, labels reaching out
Buzz is peaking out, when I'm doing everything I dreamed about
Man, I think I'm on one, saw the easy route, took the long one
And now they ain't ready for this crazy white boy
Running through the rap game like Donkey Kong
'Cause I be super smashing them I'm back with a rap attack
I'm homegrown and I grew the roots and it's about damn time that I flew the coop
So mother fucker let me show you what this dude could do
Going through the roof and I'm gonna hold my own
CT down to the bones, so anywhere I'm going you know I'm coming back
Because as they say, ain't no place like home so then I'm gone

[Chorus]
Ride on...yeah
Baby, where you wanna go
Got my foot up on the pedal till the sun goes down
I just hop up in the driver's seat and
Ride on...yeah
Baby, where you wanna go
We be riding, we be riding
We be riding, yeah we be riding on

I'm here to do my thang, so what you really know about that shit
Good kid in a fucked up game, suitcase still packed from the last trip
Like this and I feel alright, turned around my life
Started from the bottom, now I'm in the middle
Sitting first class on a flight and I still got fight
As long as I got a mic I'll recite the type of hype shit that'll spark ignite
And set the world on fire when I give it a light
You never heard of one like this in your life because I go so hard
Got these bars on me, baby, I'm a super star and the bass go roar
Like I got Simba trapped in the trunk of my car
R-R-Roger that the rhyme is [?], stepping on the gas pedal when I ride[write?] a track
Real shit, anybody that deny the facts, fuck you, ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody got time for that shit, the same kid crashing Datpiff
Is back to the smack the world off it's axis
I'm in the game now, you better go home and practice
Firework in the sky bitch, get so high, fuck around and hit a pilot
I'm just feeling like it really is my time, this rhyme shit ain't for the weak
Don't try this, at home if you ain't ready for the life, this game [?] whether or not you like it
So I'm telling you all the ups and downs so you can see the world I'm in, 
Looking through my eyelids

Ride on...yeah

We be riding, we be riding
We be riding, yeah we be riding on

Came close to being [?][I could of made it?]
Frustrated with the industry, how can I motivate it
Feeling like the only loser that my parents pro-created
Watching homies that associated with me [?][Know I waited for my turn?]
[?] It was so belated, I was jaded, when I made it, it was hard to believe
Even harder for me not to wear my heart on my sleeve
But, people judging me in the public
And I started to read, the comments underneath my video, my skin is thick enough
It's hard to describe the feeling when somebody telling me that my music got them through when they were feeling like giving up
He standing right in front of me and [?]
Cause he enough with his girlfriend and they breaking up
He breaking up, playing my music it helps to lighten the blow
Player wishing to sleeping like 20 times in a row
Mouthing the lyrics when they hear it getting hype at the show, I love it
Ain't got no money, but I'm getting through
Gotta remind my self, time to time when I get in a depressing mood
I'm getting paid first[?]
[?]
Look at my dressing room
1,000 miles away they want an autograph
He said he like my deep records and my party tracks
I scribble things across the bottom half
It's Rittz and Chris Webby, you ready, let's hit the launching pad, let's fly

Chris Webby,"It’s Chris Webby, getting high as fuck right now
I’m hella sick, and no one knows what I’m infected with
So hi it’s nice to meet you
I’m the guy your girl been texting with
Evil rap nemesis, lighting up that heady shit
That’s potent as the poison in a fucking box jellyfish
In a box Chevy with the soldiers in my fellowship
Legolas and Aragorn cruising through Connecticut
Leave behind a trail of empty bottles and jealous chicks
Throw around bread, I’m on my Hansel and Gretel shit
A psychopath on a path of destruction
Popping Xanax til I’m seeing black
I better pass the Dutch Master I’m puffing
The first up the the mic but the last to the function
Stumbling drunk with a busty chick with a passion for sucking
East Coast, we don’t borrow your swagger for nothing
We’d rather start a battle instead of having a discussion
So pass it back to me, cousin
Shit I’m so nice I could spit this shit right here backwards in Russian!

No sound like the one I got
They can hear it anytime I rock
Cause all I got’s my balls and my word
And this baggie full of herb
And I’m coming for that #1 spot

I’ve always been a loose cannon
They say I rolled off of a pirate ship
High as shit, Bobby Costas, look how red my eyes’ll get
I’m out in Sochi, 720 to a flying split
And land all up in that vagina bitch, huh
See I be showing them what I can do with this shit
Yo what you think I was new to this shit?
Got a beautiful chick in the passenger seat

Thought that I wanted it so I just shot for the sky
Now I don’t even know why
Gave it a try, wanted a piece of the pie, now it’s a fucking surprise
The way that I’m living is different
I’m hitting and missing, and I’m just here trying to vibe
Oh my god, all this shit done changed, people be noticing me
Now they all love me, or hate me
Like there ain’t no in between
I’m doing me, and that’s all I know
Out on the road doing these shows
To give you the fans a little piece of my soul
But you must know I’m just like you when I ain’t got no mic
So if you see me out in public show me respect and we aight
And yes you can have an autograph
But if I’m with a girl or my family and friends
I don’t get that much so please don’t ask
Pick and choose, you respect me as a person, I’ll reciprocate
Tip my hat and give you dap and I will just be on my way
If you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

I’m just tryna live my life like I’m supposed to be
While I’m following the path that has chosen me
Now it’s everywhere I go people notice me
Feet planted with my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low, and I don’t see no haters
My eyes red, cause I’m always medicated
Now they say I made it, cause I’m elevated
But my feet planted and my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low, I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low with my head up high
And I’ma keep my brim low

Always be keeping my hat to my brow
And my head in the clouds
Shit has been stressing me so I been rolling this loud
Trying to block it all out
But I know right now that this here’s my shot
Shit or get off of the pot
Shoot for the top, ain’t no looking back
This is all I got, so I will not stop
But I sacrifice my private life
That’s the shit that drives a person nuts
But I won’t lose sight of that feeling I got way back when
When I started to write
Hit Radio Shack with my dad
Bought me a mic, best day of my life
Ever since then I just make this music
Put it out for them to hate
But I’m Superman, my skin too thick to be penetrated
So many people always been telling me that I never would make it
But I’m an artist, how many times must I demonstrate it?
Now it’s my time to take it, I made my choices
But now so many people in my ear I’m hearing voices
So if you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

I’m just tryna live my life like I’m supposed to be
While I’m following the path that has chosen me

Chris Webby,"I'm on the edge, one step and I'll be over
Unless I take those 12 steps, aimed at gettin sober
That's the shit I told myself I'll handle when I'm older
And now I'm older and still got this devil on my shoulder
Bottle up my problems, like prescriptions I'm poppin
All the liquor that I find myself drinkin so often
Now these cards are dealt, told myself I don't need help
Numb myself to everything, and keep on runnin from myself

Let's drink away the pain
Let's make another toast
Let's smoke another blunt
Until it's just a roach
And pop another pill
And drop another dose
I haven't lost it yet
But now I'm coming close

I'm just chemically imbalanced (Lost my grip)
I'm just chemically imbalanced (One way trip)
And now it's too late for turnin back (x5)

Left here to battle this addictive personality
That's got me living in this alternate reality
Losing touch before this [?] so gradually
Cause at this point I need these chemicals to balance me
It's like I'm following a blueprint that the devil made
Since I first took my Ritalin in the 7th grade
The doctor gave me 16 milligrams, just a kid
Barely weighed a buck, it's like they used me as their guinea pig
Crazy teen, medicated ADD
Doctor said take only 1, but you know I was taking 3
Blazin tree and skippin class, getting drunk and missin math
Bangin chicks without a rubber, crushin pills up on the desk
Chemically imbalanced in this motherfucker, startin shit
Still I was a smart kid, got myself a scholarship
Private schools with it, button-downs with the dockers
And the JanSport full of weed stuffed into my locker

Let's drink away the pain
Let's make another toast
Let's smoke another blunt
Until it's just a roach
And pop another pill
And drop another dose
I haven't lost it yet

See I'm just wreckin out weekly, livin on repeat
Still in highschool but the teachers could never reach me
Always was the fuck up with a chip on my shoulder
And a pocket full of anything to keep me from sober
See I was livin like there's no tomorrow
Chewin on a xany bar, rollin up the window smokin blunts up in family car
Bottles to the head, got detention on the reg
Never listenin to what my parents said
I was always rollin with an ounce or two
Everytime I'm bouncin through
Flippin everybody off like Shady taught me how to do
Always thinkin that the more we burnin, the merrier
Just a kid from middle-class suburban America
And so many others like me, listen to me nightly
Happy that somebody else is feelin' what they might be
So Christian pop a pill, oh yeah I bet you will
'Cause if that shit don't make your problems any less forreal

Let's drink away the pain

The game I’m in is lonely but this shit is all I know
Riding in my Chevy down this one way road
Taking it slow, but still I’m losing control

Things that keep you up awake through the night
Praying that the moves I’m making are right
Tryna find myself a way through the fight
Yeah, it’s just a day in the life

Came up in the game just a youngin with a mean flow
Here to rock until the clock hits zero
Feel like I’m seeing the world through a peep hole
Stressed out, what you think I’m smoking weed for?
Gotta put one in the air like a free throw, or a G4
All these people doubting me and judging me without knowing me
So what you mean though?
Living life, what you hating on me for?
Oh you mad after finally getting mine
All these years on the grind I’m dropping shit
And now I’m getting shine, breaking records online
But every single one of my accomplishments
Comes at a cost, losing my mind
Always faded off of that pot prescript
Can’t slip up, I don’t got time
Nobody ever built a kind of watch for this
This life it’ll break you down so get ready
Living down this one way road in my Chevy
Carrying the weight of the world is too heavy

See, everyone thinks they know how this life works
But they don’t see the negatives
On tour at least half of the year
Missing holidays and hardly seeing my relatives
They don’t know about the stress of the game
Everyday damn day, shit it got me popping sedatives
Like they fucking jelly beans, will I ever see the end of this?
If I do, shit, will I even remember it?
I don’t know man, all this rapping shit
Got me second guessing everything I had convinced
At the end of the day, fuck it I asked for this
I wouldn’t take it back for shit
I’ma soldier, with a good head on my shoulders
In it til I win it or I get a game over
Feeling like I’m on a roller coaster
Friends turn to foes and my heart grows colder
Drawn to the game like a moth to the flame
Sacrifice it all for the fame
But it’s all worth it when you up on stage and they calling your name
No doubt I’ll be paying the price in the end
But I’m cool now taking a right down the road untraveled
Seatbelt strapped in, this is just another day in the life

And I’m feeling like I’m losing my mind
This game will lock you up for certain
But I’m doing my time
I keep a smile on my face, I keep my head to the sky
And in the end I know I’ma be alright

The spittin' game and it's gettin' laid and that after sex bogie
Any time you feelin' good, it's what your brain produces
So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's suppose to be
And that's the shit that I'm on, that's the shit that I want
Wither I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

That bamma weed you smokin', ain't fuckin' with the OG
I hit it till I'm coughing, I hit it often
I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge, cuz' I'm on the ledge
Wake up, when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin' a bounty hunter like a Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Goodbye dude, I expose these niggas', I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical mournings, gettin' us gory as biblical stories, you ignoren' the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene
You ever live the life of a heretic?
That, dopamine, from the smoke the coke the lean, is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

I'm just tryna' get my fix

Bitch on my lap, gyratin'
Loud so loud, my lungs vibratin'
High as a bitch I'm up skyscappin'
Annihilatin' some kind of [?]
That's the feelin' I feel when I am creatin'
And the fire's escapin', though your fire escape em'
Until I lie in your basement
Arise in the pavement just to arrive from inside of a spaceship
That fix, I'm suppose to dream
I chase Hennessey with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober
Promethazine in my soda, I'm suppose ta lean
My momma cookin'? Encore
The family members I die for
The two beautiful kids I stay alive for
Plus Hip-Hop makes me feel alive more
That fix

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's suppose to be
And that's the shit that I'm on, that's the shit that I want
Wither I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

Let me put you down, with some realness
You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
With that fellin' that you get when you open up your bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
With the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelt it
We the vibe at the party, when that shits about to turn up
We the ""hell ya"", ya thinkin' when the dabs about to burn up
The fist pump, bitch I'm number one, I'm the winna' by the
Toast at the table when we celebrate our [?]
Roar of the crowd when ya see something amazing
Where the thrill of victory, with the felling of elation
It's a presentation and we hope you see
You're in need of that dopamine

I'm just tryna' get my fix

Yeah, Truth spit game, murda'
Shoulda' been cased on it
Causing panic, now the living shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, look like they want to face on it
Money, long slates, givin' a open chase on it
I'm fully sober, my fix is chicks and change
And ride, n' lookin' amazing, n' something so strange
I hit the hood, just to kick it with homies
No, they need it for support, everyone that promote it
I best to dodge the phoney, cuz' I don't understand them
And I ain't tryn'
I'm the truth and I don't fuck with that [mind?], stay from [?]
Hit the studio to blackout, maybe try gettin' packed out
Just like somebody wanted this as soon as I blow it back out
I might just give a laugh as I proceed to knock a track out
And burned up the speakers in trunk tryna' act out
Say [?] [?] [?], I'm on my turn up
Get [tightest?] in them [?], [?] me a drink, you bout to turn up

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's suppose to be
And that's the shit that I'm on, that's the shit that I want
Wither I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong

Til I'm sipping margaritas off the coast of Ibiza
With a bowl full of reefer, eyes low as Khalifa's
And got two lovely senoritas making home-cooked pizza
And anything we need I throw on the Visa, I'm getting there!

But now I'm varsity and I'm filling the bleachers

You critics can't deny it, shut your mouth and keep it quiet

I do this shit the livest, so yo please don't kill my vibe, bitch
Or I'm setting off a riot in this bitch, don't even try it
I've been working everyday, I think I need a vacation
And your girl been feeling me just like a TSA agent
So even if you haven't heard of me, at least she did

[Freestyle: Chris Webby]
Yo, it’s Chris Webby
At this party and shit, motherfucker wants me to rap
I’m about to open an abortion clinic right next to your local church
And go to narcotics anonymous hustling coke and percs
I’m just trying to piss you off, I really hope it works
Go berzerk, I got a dirty mouth, I’ll never hold a curse
Jerking off until my motherfucking shoulder hurts
Even if she vegan she gon swallow when my boner squirts
Help an older lady across the road, “hey can I hold your purse?”
Then kick her in front of a moving bus, “oh no, she’s hurt!”
Shit I’m pretty sure she’s dead but you can check yourself
While I run her wallet and spend all the money at Taco Bell
Anyone this deranged should surely be locked in jail
I’m on the grind but off the rails like an Eric Koston fail
I hit it rapid fire, try to pull out of a vaginal cavity
But busted while I was half inside her
Then I woke up in the morning and had a reminder
That she getting plan B for breakfast with an apple cider
Someone pass the lighter, I need some weed to breathe in
He’s a demon, dirty mind, sneaky heathen
I don’t need a reason
I’m creeping up like sex offenders with binoculars on a beach in bikini season
You won’t see me leaving, I’m running through that
Stomp you to death then throw my Nike’s back on the shoe rack
Huh I’ma do that, why bother tryna bleach the blood stains out?
Somebody told me orange is the new black
So I scrub my white T til it turns the color copper
And use some Tide detergent and throw it up in the washer
It’s weird that I ain’t crazy though, shit you can ask my doctor
Sike, I’m off my rocker like an active grandfather, motherfucker

WEBBY: Your turn, bro

Chris Webby,"Web you got the CD?
Course I got the fuckin' CD man, fuckin' big meeting and shit
We're pretty late though, you think we're gonna be good?
I think we're gonna be all set man
Just pick up your pants a little bit
No talking about Adderal, no talking about banging this guy's wife like.. (of course, of course) keep it real good
Oh shit, is that that fucking BarsTaLoan guy again?

I'm an untrained dog, no collar
Had loose screws since I was a toddler
Yo don't bother
Up in this bitch drinking vodka like water
Do you read me? Roger, I am a monster
All young buck white kids put the mic down, I am your father
Still be drinking like I did when I was up at Hofstra
Taking more shots than I did playing Contra
Hold up, hold up, hold up, wait
Let me take a sip of water, I don't know if I'm straight
Lost track of all the LIT's that I drank
And I'm feeling like I just might faint
But I lace my sneakers, eat a piece of pizza
And throw another [?] up on the Visa
Bangin' out those speakers
Going hard in the paint like I fucked Mona Lisa
Where the chronic B?
My short term memory is chronically
Fucked up, cause I burn down constantly
How could I shape up? I forgot geometry
But they gon' learn CT and geography
Cause I got the whole damn world watching me
It's hard to even keep up with it honestly
Let's gettin' it muthafuckin' poppin' B
Will lose some brain cells
I don't think I'm leaving this
Muthafucker, 'til someone takes away my keys and shit
I haven't been trained well, I'm so disobedient
Got that verbal dope, so just holla if you need a fix
Drop a freestyle, daily fire
Lighting up a bong up that'll take me higher
Crazy rhymer, that's known to cross the line like a stereotypical Asian driver
Web so sick that I make'em nauseous
Go balls out, never play it cautious
Went from a dorm room to rapping to muthafuckers in suits in a label office
I'm a beast on the mic with a beatbox flow
Anybody steppin' after he rocks, no
He got flow, I'm an animal, follow my name with an e-i, e-i, e-i-o
Seat ride low when I'm cruising in
With a cup full of brown like Julian
With a trailer park boy and some hooligans
Got bars, yeah I got a few of them

Chris Webby,"I've had some of my best times chillin' at the bar yo
Doing stupid shit, that I won't remember tomorrow
Waking up confused, still wearing my shoes
Thinking back like ''Yoo What the fuck did I do?!''
Nights like this started with a pre-game
Give me an auxiliary chord, now I'm the DJ
Playing what I wanna hear, none of the Pop shit
Give me the Big L, Wu Tang and Pac shit
Drinking till I'm buzzing like my phone's on vibrate
Taking another shot just to clear my mind state
Now im feeling good, never any less

And I don't wanna push my luck
Cause I'm already so drunk
I just threw my dinner up (But fuck it)
I've been trained to be a weekend warrior
So the puke and rally move is in my wheelhouse, of course sir
Living on the border
There is no other option
Even if the memories we make are all forgotten
I'll be sipping my concoction
I'm mid twenties, drinking like I'm 18 back in high school
Is that a problem?
Na man, this is not a race
Imma have my fun now
And mature at my own pace

Everybody's drunk now, most of them are passed out
Reach into my back pocket and pull a bag out
Then finally the herb come around
Blunt ride back and burn the fuck down
Getting so high, that my contacts dry
Put the visine in my eyes
So go and live your lives, we'll only get to do it once

Chris Webby,"Hello, in a muscle car murdered out
With a purple ounce, that motherfucker that you heard about
Spread around the internet because of word of mouth
Cannonballed off the deep end and swam further out
Tryna stack absurd amounts with a purdy spouse
Put one in the air like Super Smash pulling Kirby out
Jury’s out? Fuck it, I don’t care I’ma vent
And get fucking intense like Native American sex
Fuck the money, when I started I was there for respect
That’s why I’m still in Connecticut where my chariot rest
I’m on the edge, do y’all dare me to step?
Will y’all just find another rapper to rep and even care if I left?
Watched too many people run with my formula and get famous
Now all of em fucking famous and boy I’m just fucking waiting
Put my life up on the line for the glory that I’ve been chasing
Recording down in my basement, money poor but I was patient
Now I’m hustling and moving up, kid’s super tough
I ain’t popping? I tell em soon enough
I kept my circle tight, it never loosened up
And cut the snakes out like Medusa up at Super Cuts
It’s my job to get up on mics and say wild shit
Never once did I suggest that you should try it
Shut your trap, I’ma need a little silence
Let me do my job, is that alright bitch?

Hello, it’s so good to see you, it’s so nice to be back
Gather up ladies and gentlemen, just vibe to the track
Grab a seat, dim the lights while I’m reciting this rap
Best in the burbs, let's remind 'em why my title is that
It’s good to see you, it’s so nice to be back!

I remember being lost and hopeless in my parent’s attic
Feeling claustrophobic, but I never lost my focus
I’m back, hurting from a mix of mild scoliosis
And the weight of carrying the fucking state up on my shoulders
I’m on a marathon ahead of you, dude
They sucking wind, turning bluer than a jeopardy clue
The jealous ones developing resentment for the crew
Without knowing what I’ve been through
So come and step in these shoes
So what I didn’t sell crack and had a stabler home life?
Middle class white, they been hating my whole life
But they saw me grow up just like Raven Symone, right?
Scrawny little punk, to the Razor Ramon type
Independent and continually making fans
Turned down a lot of deals, and chose to make a stand
Fuck selling out, homie that ain’t the plan
Why push the envelope? I’m tackling the mail man
So here I am as I’m rambling, pants sagging
And ransacking the game, no receipt for the transaction
And they hopping right on to the band wagon
With this puff the magic dragon stuffed into a gram bag and
Attacking these beats thoroughly, in my prime currently
Only way to get me to shut my mouth is to murder me
Sure to be a legend, impressing with every story told
Go balls to the wall like I’m fucking y’all through a glory hole
My destiny is still an open book, just haven’t had my moment
I’m still underrated and overlooked
But fuck it yo I feel terrific
We’ve already made it further than anybody predicted
Tapes on tapes with a handful of crazy tours
Led here, this the moment we been waiting for

My cologne say Versace, my dick say blow me
My drawers say polo, yeah bitch polo!
Need a white girl with an ass like Coco’s

Better bow before Nina, don’t even try to spit at the great
Sick, then I’ma get pissed at em when they get wack and fake
Bitch, get on my dick quick, give it a lick it, acclimate
Get what you’re giving, get with the gift and go gravitate
Acting a ape, I ate up a animal I aggravate
Whole lotta people getting a whiff of the Niner
They loving a nigga cause I’m a hell of a rhymer
Women are looking finer, I never decline her
She wanna climb my timer, stick it in her slimer
I get the pudding, never gotta wine and dine her
When a busta run up with a broken heart he get a shiner
When it comes to murking on music I’m a deadly designer
I’m drinking my Hennessy mixture out of a Steiner!
If you tripping on my bucker I’ma cut a nigga up with a machete
Cause I’m running with a gang that’ll bring that flame
With a thang and it’s heavy
You don’t wanna fuck with a Tech N9ne
Or my nigga JB or Chris Webby
Havin everybody sayin “oh no”, bustin up the window of a 6 Chevy

Yeah I got em saying

From the second they see us coming, I got em saying…

Hold up
On your mark, ready, set, go
Look at Web flow
I be jabbing with the right and then I hit em with a left blow
Knock em back in time like they chilling with Bill and Ted, yo
To a land before time, T-Rex ho
So many bars you would think I’m living on Death Row
Webby’s just a motherfucking dog, where’s Petco?
Followed a plate of kibbles n bits with an egg roll
Genius in the laboratory cooking blue meth, yo
Call me Heisenberg, cause when I rhyme with words
These motherfuckers are behind the curve
I drive and swerve, turn and I ride the curve
And hit every pedestrian that doesn’t find the nerve…
...to get out of the way, “Jarren did you see that shit?”
Yeah maybe you should drive, cause the weed I hit
Got me feeling so loco, la vida, bitch
Why you even pass me that shit?
But fuck it man I’m an animal, but you never seen my species
Brand new breed they discovered in CT
Homegrown bitch, yelling “feed me, feed me!”
And every listener is pressing repeat
Bitch I got a sick mind, stomach bug in the brain
Insane, you gotta keep me handcuffed with a chain
But I’ll still break out like Burt Wonderstone
So anytime you see me coming, yo, I got em yelling out..

Goddamn I did it, I built the stage to get my voice heard on
And it’s real to say
Shit I’m still a normal dude, got bills to pay
And if tomorrow’s not promised I’ma chill today
Cause like you we all bleed red, we all human
We all just tryna navigate our way through the confusion
We all just want a piece of the pie
I’m staying zooted while I’m waiting
Let me roll up a doobie and keep it moving
I got a few chinks in my armor, too
Never used to see the world, now I’m starting to
And I’m just reaching for the motherfucking stars like you
Without a joint that shit’s hard to do
So I tell em that...

We all gonna die one day, so what?
But while I’m kicking I’ma have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
Cause when life gets tough I shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
And we all got bills to pay, so what?
But while I’m in the green I’ll have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”

As I watch my competition and proceed to one-up em
And if they don’t like what I’m doing then, man, fuck em
And if they ain’t been down since jump I can’t trust em
Ever since my friend ratted on me and I ended up cuffed
In the back of an undercover whip
Cause my homie couldn’t help but run his lip
As soon as the fan was hit with some fucking shit
But that’s life and I’ve learned how to choose my friends better
Learned how to master my craft and be a trendsetter
Learned how to get knocked down
Learned how to get back up
I learned how to rock these crowds
Learned to accept that what’s...
...going on is a blessing beyond a logical fact
I don’t know if God is real but someone’s watching my back
Maybe it’s my boy Nick, we still miss you cuz
Next joint’s for you, now roll up

We all gonna die one day, so what?
But while I’m kicking I’ma have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
Cause when life gets tough I shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
And we all got bills to pay, so what?
But while I’m in the green I’ll have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
And when shit gets rough I’ll shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Chilling, baking out my Chevy with my crew in the cut
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff

I’m gonna take a puff
Then I’ma blow it out
I’m gonna roll it up
And then I’ma burn it down

So baby come to Webby’s world, I’ll make you famous tonight
Place your bets y'all gon' pay it in full
Never graduated from school but I made it this cool
Now I’m here motherfucker, ain’t no April fools
Right to the top like I’m defying gravitational pull
'Cause I started young but I’m older now
Learned a lot up in the game, got a doper sound
Travelling around the world, getting cultured now
But still rolling with my dogs when I’m homeward bound
When I see Sap at the back of the weed spot
We gon get so fucking high that we pass it to Ewok
Then we turn it up so loud that the back of your seat rocks
From the very second that the beat drops

If you tryna get it cracking let me know!
I’m about to set it off, whoa, bitches getting low
They be sweating when I be walking through the door
I’m about to set it off

Stay writing while rhyming and stage diving
All in, going so hard I could break diamonds
I been patiently waiting but learned that it takes time
And now I got the same look in my eye as a caged lion
I been on my hustle why the fuck you think I’m doing this?
Book of rhymes thicker than a Tarantino movie script
Rolling up a doobie and we jumping in the Uber whip
Until the driver take me to the top, I’m bout to do this shit
So animated, call me Bugs Bunny
Since I used to battle cats for they lunch money
Always had the same clothes, looking duck funny
Straight dummy but Webby was never dumb, buddy
I knew I’d have my moment, so let me soak it in
With your chick and, uh, some of her closest friends
‘Cause they know it now if they didn’t know it then

But I said “fuck that!” I’ma do it Web’s way
‘Cause I’m fucking dope, well at least that’s what my friends say
Lyrically a sensei, muy caliente, comprende?

It’s not what I try for but it’s my business
Homie you should mind yours
I couldn’t lose my mind more
Jumping out the window on the 9th floor
Now they’re saying they gotta send me to the psych ward
Straightjacketed, a battle it ain’t happenin’

Lighting up an L again and hit it til my head’ll spin
Started with a crumpled up Lincoln and now it’s Benjamins
Used to be a loser but now the world is watching Webby win
It’s so easy, veni, vidi, vici

Used to be on YouTube, now I’m up on TV
Everybody spell it out, it’s W-E-B
Add another B-Y, you’re about to see why

Chris Webby,"Lately I've been contemplating
Watching humans tear apart this fucking planet
Like they've never heard of moderation
The people running things ain't worried bout no conservation
Unless there's money in the conversation
But what happens when the soil is too toxic for the plants to grow
And all our drinking water is polluted (got the answer bro?)
All I know is humans are the cancer of the planet
Forecast: lots of global warming with a chance of snow
Hoping things will change but I doubt they ever will
Mother nature dying while we yelling drill, baby drill
So in turn the world's heating up, climate change creeping up
Hell, at least those folks at Exxon made a decent buck
Carbon footprints on the world that'll never wash away
While the ones in charge of it ignoring what we got to say
Still we gotta try, all we got is you and I
Put your mother fucking fists in the sky, come and

Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

I don't dabble much in things that are political
But it ain't hard to see
That half these politicians running shit are criminal
They way we written history is strictly fictitiously
Still they try tricking me, telling me that I'm living free
Now keeping quiet while they take away our freedoms
(Hell, they're just the constitutional laws, who fuckin' needs em?)
And the mainstream media decides what you'll be seeing
So I'm sceptical of everything, don't know what to believe in
'Cause they lying to us right under our noses
And we know it but there's nothing we can do to control it
And it's got me losing sleep
'Cause I'm seeing shit different than when I was younger
Watching world hunger while the economy's going under
Too caught up in reality shows and cell phones
Eatin' food full of GMO's to say
Yo! I've had enough of all these lies, all we got is you and I
Put your fucking fists up in the sky, come and

Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

See now we've got these countries beefin' with us
Like some World War III shit
Things about to change, you'd be blind not to see this
Civil unrest, the greatest country in the west
Bout' to crumble like the Roman Empire, nonetheless
Our oceans full of plastic, and the air is full of chemicals
Well, we let it happen like it's consensual
But fuck that
Educate yourselves and don't fall for what they been tellin'
Just tell them to throw there fist in the sky and start a rebellion!",Stand Up

Rest In Peace Patrice O'Neil
Roll up another blunt
Now how that Diesel feel?
Got me swerving man
Who the fuck gave me the wheel?
Who the fuck gave me these pills?
Now I'm off in another dimension
In need of an intervention
Cause these drugs are too fucking expensive
But I'm feeling terrific dude
Banging these broads with no fucking protection
Yeah, what were you saying babe?
I wasn't paying any fucking attention
Rumbling engine, rolling up in my Camaro and cruise
Living it like a pirate man
Always got me a barrel of booze
Skipping the food
Go right for the tiramisu
Sippin' and rippin' the bubbler
Puffing until I can barely move
Lay back and then stare at the moon, ooh
Bippidy bobbidy boo

Turnt up, finna fuck it up
I guarantee that the crowd go crazy
When I hit the stage, you could bet a hunnit bucks

Smoking the finest, getting the highest
Getting the mommas, you know when I'm coming
Just smell for the ganja
Vegas; soldierz, takin' over
Traveling and taking shots
Tattoo shops, don't forget the place to rock
I need a nasty girl to taste the cock
In the office, running all over these niggas
Like bitches, you niggas is softer than niggas

Roll one up in that Swisher Sweet
Sticky green, sticky green
With orange hairs, like Pete and Pete
Flowing double time when I freak the beat
Holding up mine when I hit the street
Burn so much, I be high for weeks
Spit it so dirty, I need new sheets
My grinder's full, and I ain't talkin turkey, cheese
I'm talking AK47, Purple Kush and Sour D
Put it in the bowl, I'll get a dutchie rolled
Sprinkle some keef on it, and then away we go
Get in the flow, lighting up heady to dro
Partying on, got that confetti to throw
Killing the spot from the moment
That Webby'll step in the door
Hit some shit, got my pencil gripped

And I ain't going away

Standing tall, head high, doing what I wanna do
If I fall, I get up, I done came too far to lose
Pushing through, pick it up, even when my body's tired
I got enough drive inside to set the fuckin world on fire

What can I do for me now
Used to the enemy shooting me down
But truthfully how
Could you try to stop me when truth can be found?
And knowing that life is a lesson
Don't question what you can be now
We let this aggression take over and over and over
A chip on our shoulder bigger, ignore what they told us
I told you I was a soldier (yeah)
Never quit, don't fall, if I do, I apologize y'all
Might slip, won't trip, to be real, shit, I idolize y'all, why?
Cuz if you hear me now you ain't take the easy way out
You knew there was light at the end of the tunnel
When you couldn't see a way out
Faith is what you can't teach, haters may say what you can't reach
As long as I stay playing these beats
At the end of my day, y'all I'm at peace
Peace of mind, Imma just ease my mind
Relieved with the peace I find
And ease my rhymes, I need my time

Ain't nobody thats gone stop you
Don't cry home boy that's not you

Told myself I got this shit (is this my time?)
Better hope to God it is
Losing my mind, show me a sign
I’m no astrologist but I just need to know
Cause I really put all that I got in this
When all I had was empty bank accounts and broken promises
Life ain’t like the comics, ain’t no Superman to save the day
Ain’t no one to clear the road, it’s on you to pave the way
Get your dreams tatted up, never let em fade away
And toughen up that skin and disregard what all them haters say
Listen I been through all that too
What you think I ain’t been down on my luck?
I’m dealing with shit on the daily, it’s driving me crazy
But I ain’t about to give up
Keeping my family close so I can know everybody around me I trust
Now I got Earth right up in my hands
Get ready cause this shit about to combust, what?
I’m not lying when I say
That the world could end tomorrow, set fire to it today

I'm tryna find my happy place and you're welcome to tag along

Handle yours like a soldier, and make em say…

To taste for to descend, to let me in
Maybe it's okay now if you turn and run away

Anesthetic days of crusades and consent, the idiot intent
And though our love was likely your disease is so competent
You're so proud of the few risks you've taken, child

Who'll rape and campaign until you resign
And I'd return your letter but I'm feeling unrefined

From counterpane to stratosphere
All conclusions fade to black
Is there freedom from the hemisphere
Where there is no going back

I been living in a rocket house
Empty buildings go flying by
So trapped above the atmosphere
I got no time to say goodbye",Rocket House
Chris Whitley,"Once upon a time
You knew where you belonged
But time slips away
Now there's no return
Say goodbye to yesterday

You can kiss the past so long
(Nothing matters anyway)
Say goodbye, it's already gone
Don't let these changes run you round

Who could know tomorrow
Say goodbye and don't look back down
Just say goodbye to yesterday

All will be released
Yesterday deceased
All will be revealed
Let yourself to feel

On the other side of the world

Until a secret sends you home
Liberation follows the revolt

Well it could never come apart
Alone as I and only you

A latent savior gradually deceased

I went back where the criminal saved the day
There's so much wreckage around here
Always some price to pay

I ain't got a clue

How could I adjust
Should I see her bleeding

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can remember

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

Chris Young,"Tuxedo waiters, black tie,
White table clothes and red wine,
We've been planning, this night,
Looking forward to it, for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up,
And you know I love showing you off,
But watching your baby blue eyes,
Dancing in the candle light glow,
All I can think about, is getting you home

Walking through the front door,
Seeing your black dress hit the floor,
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing, like you loving
Me all night long, and all I can think about is getting you home

I don't need this menu, no I don't,
I already know just what I want,
Did I hear you right, did you tell me,
Go pay the waiter and lets leave,
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes,
And your hand drawing hearts on mine,
That our night out of the house, ain't gonna last too long,

Chris Young,"She was a flower for the takin'
Her beauty cut just like a knife
And he was a banker from Macon
Swore he'd love her all his life

Bought her a mansion on a mountain
With a formal garden and a lot a land

But paradise became her prison
That Georgia banker was a jealous man

Every time he'd talk about her,
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say,
I would walk through Hell on Sunday,
To keep my rose in paradise

He hired a man to tend the garden,
To keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say that gardener left alone

Now the banker is an old man
And the mansion's crum-ble-ing down
He sits all day and stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found

Radio turned up and playin' loud
A honky-tonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole world's asleep and we're wide awake in the A.M.

In the A.M.

Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
Hey baby, tell me what ya think about
Getting out of this place and
Let me show you my Chevrolet and
We can sit and do a little stargazing
Get a little bit of alone time, in the A.M.
Yeah, in the A.M",A.M.
Chris Young,"Found a quarter on the sidewalk
A love letter in a shoebox
I found a snake underneath a rock
Wish I could find forgiveness
A sand dollar on the seashore
An old dresser in an antique store
A rusty whistle in the bottom drawer
Wish I could find forgiveness

It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed of someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
One sleepless night it dawned on me
The peace I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you

Was too stubborn for my own good
I never listened like I knew I should
I don't deserve it but I wish you would
Find me some forgiveness
For every night I wasn't there
For all the times I didn't care
I admit that it was never fair
Wish I could find forgiveness

It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed of someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
But one sleepless night it dawned on me
The peace I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you

I've seen a broom run across a floor
Taking with it what was there before
And that's the kind of clean I came here looking for

It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed with someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
But one sleepless night it dawned on me
The peace I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you

Wish I could find forgiveness",Forgiveness
Chris Young,"Knock on my door
You're on my porch
It's about 11:30
And that only means
One of two things
Either you're a little bit lonely
Or something ain't right
And judging by
That tear in your eye
You're about to say something crazy
Like goodbye

Stop right there
Don't say a word
Just let me hold you
Girl, we can fix
Whatever it is
So whatever you do
Don't let us die
The love of a lifetime
Is worth at least a million tries
Baby what we got
Is too good for goodbye

This ain't a game
I'm trying to play
Girl, we got something real here
You don't just break up
Whenever it gets tough
So baby, don't you leave here
I want you to say
You're gonna stay
And we're in this thing forever
Come whatever, so

Stop right there

I can hardly catch my breath
When I see you look this way
And I've been sitting here all night long
Waiting on your favorite song
It's finally starting to play

Baby, do you feel that bass line pumpin'
Tell me, can you hear that kick drum thumpin' on the 2 and 4
Let's get on that floor
Love to hear the slide of the guitar ringin'
Melody's saying everything I'm thinking
And I'm starting to
To think you think it too
I love the way you're movin'
Feel the back-beat groovin'
I wanna hold you to it

Damn, when you start to sway your hips
I start thinkin' about your lips
On mine and mine on them
And I love dancin' with you so much
I ask the DJ to turn it up
And keep playin' that song again,
And again and again

Baby, do you feel that bass line pumpin'

Chris Young,"Cover band on a Flora-Bama deck
A thousand sun-burned souls
Rum-runners and cold Bud Light
A little Friday night summertime rock and roll
Packed in tight, they were singin' along
I was hanging on the edge of the crowd
When you spilled your beer down the back of my shirt
You had me when I turned around

Guitars on the gulf breeze
Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No, that ain't what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
Lighters in the air

That one look led to a walk on the beach
And more kisses than I could count
The best kind of wild and down-home smile
I've ever had these arms around
The amps were screamin' and the people were too
While we were slow dancing in our bare feet
Ain't it funny how we missed it all
And still didn't miss a thing?

Guitars on the gulf breeze
Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No, that ain't what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air

The thought of you won't let me go
It's been holding on for years
It don't take much to take me back
Every time I hear

Guitars on the gulf breeze
Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No, that ain't what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air

Raise your lighters in the air",Lighters in the Air
Chris Young,"Tuesday night crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through that cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine

Lonely eyes
Well, it sure looks like
You just might
Be looking for something
For something, whoa
Look at me
And I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes
Don't have to be alone tonight

They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let 'em go
From the little bit I've seen
They're the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way,
Heaven help me, make 'em stay

Lonely eyes
Well, it sure looks like
You just might

Like a guitar calls for strings, without 'em it can't sing
About that girl, she's my world, the one thing on my mind

Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
That way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
And she's callin' my name

Like a jukebox calls for change so it can pick a love song to play
Just like last call calls for one more drink

That way she don't have to say a thing

That wink when her dress starts falling

Baby I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pounding my chest, you in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat

You make me feel like I could fly
Like some old roller coaster ride
The way you flip your hair
Well girl it gets me every time
You drive me that perfect kind of crazy

Pounding my chest, you in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat, heartbeat

In the middle of the floor we're swaying
And your favorite song is playing

We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back

I wish you could see you are all I need

I just need my guy, lost what's on my side
Ladders we can climb
That's what it is babe, I'm in this for you
Take a train or drive, we don't need no ride
Flashy ain't my style
That's what it is babe, I'm in this for you

Nothing compares to how you hold me (nothing compares to you)
Nothing compares to how you love me, Oh baby (nothing compares to you)
It's you I need, No not the dough oh! (it's you I need oh)

You making money, keeping me comfy
I wish you could see you are all I need

I just need my guy, love was on my side
Ladders we can climb

Chrisette Michele,"What's the feeling that I get
Every single time I look deep into your eyes
What's the tingle that I feel
At the touch of your hand up and down my spine
What's so funny, in my belly trying to tell me something
Feels like butterflies
What's the feeling, what's the tingle, what's the tickle,
What's the world got for you and I

And I swear it's real,
Yes it is can't nobody ever tell me otherwise
And I swear I feel,
No I can't deny what I'm feeling inside

Is this the way love feels?
Have I found it for real?
What will time reveal?
Is this the way love feels?

Every time I hear your voice
Well it seems I have no choice but to be amazed
It's like music to my ears
How I really love to hear everything you say
Does love really have a way of speaking in every unconventional way
What's a voice, what's a touch, tell me is it really love, does it feel this way?

And I swear it's real,
Yes it is can't nobody ever tell me otherwise
And I swear I feel,
No I can't deny what I'm feeling inside

Is this the way love feels? (oh, the way it feels)
Have I found it for real? (oh, oh, for real)
What will time reveal? (oh, oh, reveal)
Is this the way love feels? (oh, oh)

I always knew love would take hold of me soon
But I never knew just how deep,
I never knew just how sweet this love would be
It looks like I have got my eye on something real
So real, so real just between you and me

Is this the way love feels? (oh, the way it feels)
Have I found it for real? (oh, oh, for real)
What will time reveal? (oh, oh, reveal)
Is this the way love feels? (oh, oh)

Chrisette Michele,"I seen his brother at The Cloud
Looking next to Fly
His sticks was pounding on the drums
When I caught his eye
You know, my gosh, he looked at me

And he smiled at me
And he played to me
And I imagined that he spoke to me

Later on I found his friend
I said, ""Do you know that guy?""
He said, ""Hold, girl, well, sure I do""
And to my surprise
He's been saying, ""Who's that girl?""

And he's feeling you
And he thinks you're cute
And he wants to try and talk to you

Reaching out to me
I took a chance and took a grab
These hands were soft and sweet
I told him he was beautiful

And he played real sweet
And he smiled at me
And it was so real when he spoke to me

I put his digits in my phone
And I promise I'd call
Ran outside and told my girls
I spoke to drummer boy
I smiled the whole way to the crib

He was feeling me
And he spoke to me
I can't believe he spoke to me

Mr. Drummer Boy spoke to me, yes, it's true
Maybe soon, he will call me his girl
And I'll call him my boy, you know
He could play the drums for my shows

Chrisette Michele,"What's your definition of it? How's it make you feel?
Tell me what'd you say that truly makes it real
Kings and queens, philosophers have tried so hard to find
Tell me what it means to you, dear, never mind

Love is kind when the world is cold
Love stays strong when the fight gets old
Love is a shoulder to lean on, love is you

Love's like the water when the well runs dry
Quench my thirst, keep me alive
Just need one sip, baby, love is you
Love is you, love is you, love is you, love is you

Is it possible there's a kiss that's so divine?
Or am I just too fool? Is it all in my mind?
Is there something chemical? A scientist might say
Well, love must be drug to make me feel this way

'Cause love is my permission to be who I am
Knowing the business 'cause you understand
Freedom to breathe, oh baby, love is you

Love's like a kiss when the sun goes down
Holds me tight when no one's around
Love's what I wanna hold on to, love is you
Love is you, love is you, love is you, love is you
Love is you, love is you, love is you, love is you

Love is kind, it makes me stronger
I don't have to look no longer
You're the one I'd cling to, love is you

When the chips are down
Love will stick around
I'm so glad I found, love is you

Masters have tried to clarify
Love's quite simple, it's just my guide
A perfect definition
Love is you, love is you, love is you, love is you, is you

Wishing my steps were longer
So by your sides I could keep
Hold your hand much bigger
Never wanted mine to grow
So I could always fit perfect
Inside your palms just so

No one loves me just like you do
No one knows me just like you do
No one can compare to the way my eyes fit in yours

And I'll always be your joy

Laid me on your belly
Nights when mama wasn't home
Lightning made me shiver
And you never let me feel alone
I tried to match your breathing
Beating my little heart against yours
Perfect were the nights we were sleeping
I never want to end what we are

And no one knows me just like you do
No one can compare to the way my eyes fit in yours

And ask my love away from me

I'll be your strings and I won't let you fall

Look to my fingers, there's hope in my hands
Come to my pocket and I'll give what I can

Singin' bout a man that's gone
And cryin' while I look out the window
It's easy to move on
I don't care if he calls no more, whoa oh

At least that's what I tell myself to make it through
The days and nights alone here when I'm missin' you
I'm tryin' not to trip but I don't feel comfortable
Cuz every time I go to turn on the radio

They're playin our song
Every time that I hear it
My heart wants to jump out of my chest doin such a rush
They're playin' our song and my whole body feels it
It's cryin' out baby,baby,baby,baby,baby

I ain't that every girl that's brokenhearted
Waitin' for a telephone call
And holdin' so tight to my pillow
See life really started the moment that you left me alone whoa,oh,oh

Chrisette Michele,"I can't even believe we're having this conversation again, oh my god.
Here's the thing
I need you to stop treatin' me as if I'm simple or naive.
As if I don't know nothing bout the world.
I understand you think you protecting me, but I could use a little room to breathe
And the respect you give a woman not a girl
Here's the thing
I appreciate all the love
The constant catering kisses and hugs
But lately I'm wondering what you do it for
If the reason you act all over sweet is cause you want to keep me on a leash.
I have no choice but to show you the door.

[Chorus: x2]
If you want to cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down
I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman I am not your porcelain doll

Here's the thing you wanna put me in fancy clothes
And take me everywhere you go
And show me off to all your fancy friends
Well here's the thing
I really don't mind the clothes
I love a nice dress with some open toes
But a trophy I'm not, So baby think again
(Hey) and Here's the thing
You always wanna hold my hand
And say things to me like I'm the man So let me do what a man's suppose to do
Well here's the thing you can be the man all the while
Understanding I am not a child
You're a man for sure, but baby I'm grown too
Hey hey

[Chorus: x2]

Said you gotta respect me totally
Otherwise I'm goin' up and leave
And baby I know you don't want me to do that.
So you gotta respect me totally, so when I say back up off of me
Just kiss my cheek and when I leave move back

My rhymes bridge the gap between religion and science
Cause my evidence is spiritual
I know my sheer presence is a miracle
I wasn't supposed to be here to share with you
But here I am, standing with my chest out
I take my place in history I never get left out
You stressed out and scared so it's causing you to act hard
Freedom ain't free, gotta put it on my black card
My passport claim I'm an American citizen
The constitution said I'm three fifths
I'm not a semi and guerrilla
Make my songs stronger than the horn of Gideon
Truth is the ? gave the native people syphilis
Consider this: Christopher Columbus ain't know where he was goin'
So lets stop calling our Native brothers Indians

Holding the future in the palms of my own hands
In this World, the coonery and tomfoolery
All I'm trying to do is stay true to my community
The daily news ain't the only thing that's schooling me
Watching these haters operating with impunity
Its journey dollar signs, black and white collar crimes
Running out of time, out of sight, out of mind
It gets realer and it's real in Palestine
Troubles of the World start to seem intertwined
War criminals, conflict minerals, pillagers are coming home
And five star generals telling lies in press conferences and interviews
I'm trying to take back the power cause it's been abused

We said this all before
Close the door
Close the door

Don't go on, go away
I've got no more words to say
End the song
No we can't go through the pain
Yeah you tried, take a break
If I'm wrong then that's okay
If you've got something to say
Too bad
It's better left unsaid
(Said, said, said
Unsaid, said)

Pull the plug,
Don't resuscitate
Let it die quick, no drugs
Rather pain than lies,
We both will agree
We both disagree,
So let's agree,
Let's be free

Don't go on, go away
I've got no more words to say

Said (un) said (said) said (said) said, said

Why you wanna kill me
With your lips
Won't you rather love me
With your kiss
I could be better
Without this 
Loving you used to
Be such bliss
If you give me hell
I will not miss
These, words,
They hurt, oh

Don't go on, go away
I've got no more words to say
End the song
No we can't go through the pain

Chrisette Michele,"I see it clear, my heart is here
We got each other and let's take it from there
And if I could I'd love you a forever end time

What we've been through, no one else knows
'Cause all that matters is how far this goes
And it will go until it starts again

Me and you, I look like I might
Nothing can stop love from love
And our love
You know I'm not asking for much
Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
I'm talking 'bout forever
Just a couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never

It can get hard, damn it gets rough
It can get crazy, but not for us
'Cause we gotta struggle just to stay apart

And me and you are, built like armour
Nothing can't stop love from love
And our love
And I'm not asking for much
Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
I'm talking about forever
Just a couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
Never, never

Can you see it, oh oh ooh oh
Can you see the signs from above
It's so blinding, there's no denying you and me

You and me are built like armor
Nothing can stop love from loving on us
And I'm not asking you for much
A couple of forevers
Ever, Ever
I'm the only one, you the only one
Together til never",A  Couple of Forevers
Chrisette Michele,"Strap me in real tight
I'm too cute to fall
Oh, I'm super high
Far away from it all
Got a bag to match
Carry all my burdens
Make it through it all
Even if I'm hurting

Every girl's met a boy who was just no good
Every girl's met a boy who was just no good
Put yo best dress on like a diva should
Walk above it all
Walk above it all in your winter shoes
Left, right, keep it moving, will get you

High above the drama
Strutting like a rock star
Watch me by the walk in my ten foot stilettos
Can't nobody get to me
Here where it's easy to breathe
I'm just standing free in my ten foot stilettos

I'm a real tough girl (real tough girl)
But I'm sweet at heart
Live in a real rough world
Oh I could fall apart
But I just won't fail
'Cause I was born to fly
I rise above, that's how I live my life

And an arrow’s in my back.
I won’t let the pain get me down, oh no.
I won’t fight back.

Let the cupid take me wherever he wants to go.
Fly me to the moon like an old jazz love song.
Cupid, do what you want to do.
The choice is yours.
But when I get where you’re taking me,

Love’s gonna make me
Feel better, better, better!
Love’s gonna make me
Feel better, better, better!
‘Cause getting to love’s got me losing my mind!

I’ve been wrecking my brain love’s so insane.
Cupid, help me please.
‘Cause Mr. Wrong keeps meeting me!
And I got a funny feeling love is just around the bend so
I’ll keep on pushing till love falls for me!

Let the cupid take me wherever he wants to go.
Fly me to the moon like an old jazz love song.
Cupid, do what you want to do.

I’m not my best but I’m right where I need to be.
Might not be right here but he’s on his way to me.

Lose track of things sometimes
Forgive my ways, apologize
Don't remember names all the time
But all the time I'm true

I'm avant garde, hipster
Shows in the park, summer
Live for the art, spiffster
But for the art, I'm blue
I'm only cool, no pretense
I'm on display, no defense
Sayin' what I say, no offense
I seize the day, I move
I'm only real, no magic
Do what I feel, no antics
Don't like it? Deal, no bashin'
I'm only me, just cool

I try to act modest
I'm not the star, Art is
I'm just a muse, artist
And to the art I'm true
Tryna make my dough honest
Sometimes I'm real honest
Sometimes I'm pull on list

I'm one of a kind
She was kinda the one til she told me this
I'm the one she want but I'm more like Monk
What's the point of being the loneliest of loneliest?
What's the point if all my homies and sisters?
I took you out but never should've spent that
That don't sense
Really? Would you take Billy Holiday to Holiday Inn?
Listen, you could've done better
I woulda put Ella under my umbrella
I woulda took Shacka Khan back in '83
Do it like Jay and B, bring her to Coachella
But now all she wanna do is style in Milan
And when we get there she browsin Vuitton
I guess that's what I gotta go it
'Cause I ain't tryina blow it
