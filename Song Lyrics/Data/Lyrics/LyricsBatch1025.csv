Michael Monroe,"I got new shoes
I'm walking new ground
I had old friends
But they're no longer around
I'm tired of the same scene
Playing over and over again
Some people saved me
So now I'm gonna save them

I can lay on my back and die like a dog
But there's gotta be more
There's gotta be more!

So thrill me
With something new
Thrill me
With something I can use
Thrill me
With some better news
Thrill me    

Anything for money
Now I can see just where you're at
Ain't it funny
How it always bites you back

I could crawl in a hole and hide 'til I'm old
But there's more
I know there's gotta be more

So thrill me
With something new
Thrill me
With something I can use
Thrill me
Is it something I missed?
Thrill me
Or is it something like this, check it out!",Thrill Me
Michael Monroe,"While you were looking at me
The world passed you by
You held your prejudice sacred
And left your dreams behind   

While you were looking at me
The homeless stayed in the streets
You learned to drink poisoned water
But never learned how to read

Well it's easy to put the blame on someone else
But it's hard to see yourself
Did you ever take a good look at yourself?

While you were looking at me
Airport security died
And the smugglers and the terrorists
Just walked right by

'Cause they don't dress like me
They dress like you
They wear suits and ties
Like all you hypocrites do

Well it's easy to point your finger at someone else
But it's hard to see yourself
Ain't it hard to take a good look at yourself?  

While you were looking at me
Businessmen bled you dry
You lost control of your government
It's getting scary outside!

While you were looking at me
Your children took the fall
Trying to be Mommy and Daddy
With dope and alcohol

You censor people like me
But it won't do you no good
The truth's gonna get through
No matter what you do

While you were looking at me",While You Were Looking at Me
Michael Monroe,"I loved you in the morning
Our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow
Like a sleepy golden storm.
Yes, many loved before us
I know that we are not new
In city and in forest
They smiled like me and you.
But now it's come to distances
And both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

I'm not looking for another
As I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner
Our steps will always rhyme.
You know my love goes with you
As your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes

Like the shoreline and the sea.
But lets not talk of love or chains
And things we can't untie,
Your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

But let's not talk of love or chains

Michael Monroe,"May the good lord be with you
Down every road you roam
And may sunshine and happiness
Surround you when you're far from home
And may you grow to be proud
Dignified and true
And do unto others
As you'd have done to you
Be courageous and be brave
And in my heart you'll always stay
Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young

May good fortune be with you
May your guiding light be strong
Build a stairway to heaven
With a prince or a vagabond

And may you never love in vain
And in my heart you will remain
Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young
Forever young
Forever young

And when you finally fly away
I'll be hoping that I served you well
For all the wisdom of a lifetime
No one can ever tell

But whatever road you choose
I'm right behind you, win or lose
Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young
For, forever young, forever young",Forever Young

Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

Michael Moore,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

God of love, please look down and see my people through.

Michael Moore,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Nearer your heart?

Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to

The wind blows, are we not friends?
There is no reason to let it end
Until you set me down
You say you don't love me anymore.

Michael Morgan,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Michael Musillami,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time",Goody
Michael Nesmith,"Know that something very strange
Is happening to my brain.
I'm either feeling very good
Or else I am insane.
The seeds of doubt you planted
Have started to grow wild
But feel that I must yield before
The wisdom of a child

And it's love you bring,
No that I can't deny,
With your wings,
I can learn to fly,
Sweet young thing.

People try to talk to me
Their words are ugly sounds
But I resist all their attempts
To try and bring me down..
Turned on to the sunset,
Like I've never done before.
And I listen for your footsteps
And your know upon the door.

And it's love you bring,
With dreams of bluer skies
All these things,
When I seem them in your eyes

Michael Nesmith,"I had twenty-one miles of road to go 
And fifty-four miles of dirt
There was a cold steel gleam 
In the night
I was trucking along
Down interstate five
Looking for the turn
When something snapped
And I suddenly changed my mind

I said bye bye bye
Oh, I finally took a stand
Then for the very first time
I felt like a man

So I headed on down to Mexico
I was never going back to work
Yes I had enough cash
To last me there for years
And then I cabled my folks
I said call my boss
And you can tell him
Where I left the truck
And then I went out and stocked up
On enchiladas and beer

I said bye bye bye
Whoah I finally took a stand
Then for the very first time in my life
I felt like a man, like a man man man man

Well now that all happened back in 1961
And I never went back to work
And then in 1964 I started living
Off the land
And the people back home
Still talk about me
Just running off without a word
But me and the beer
And the Mexican sunshine
We don't give a damn

Whoah no no no
I said bye bye bye
Whoah I finally took a stand
Now for the very first time
I feel like a man, a free man
","Bye, Bye, Bye"
Michael Nesmith,"Has anybody seen my power
It is gone from where I laid it down
I have only been away an hour
And I saw it when I left for town
So if you see it won't you call me promptly
It is more than just a question of time
It was two-tone and full-blown
And a dedicated friend of mine

Has anybody seen my Chevy
It is gone from where I shut it down
I've been told that it was very heavy
When I used to drive it into town
So if you see it won't you call me promptly
It is more than just a question of time
It was two-tone and full-blown
And a dedicated friend of mine

He was almost dead from helping people
And he asked me for a ride to town

Never wondering why--teardrops chaffing my eyes

Longing to be where the noted kisses fall
Lingering and still, while quietly they tell their all
Blue is the color of the sun
And nothing stops when everything is done

Now my whole world opens up in different rhymes and tunes
With the highways making up the verse
And then suddenly I see the light of something called the moon
And though my path is planned, it's not rehearsed

So I move along to the next thing on the list
Knowing full well that some of them just don't exist
But I am finally alone

Michael Nesmith,"Tonight when he hands you the keys to the car
And he says you can drive, some, but don't drive too far
Tonight when she tells you you're her only one
Remember the morning brings on the sun

And they're watching you stumble and fall
Until you're lost down below like them all

Today when they give you their words of advice
And tell you you're free, friend, as long as it's nice
Today when their words of sweet wisdom come down
Remember their smiles are hiding their frowns

And they're watching you stumble and fall
Until you're lost down below like them all

If you say you're their friend, I'm afraid you will learn
They want only friends they can have on their terms
But the love that you show them will give you an edge

Michael Nesmith,"Half the world concerned with a slightly tarnished masterpiece
Hoping to return as the once forgotten culture thief
Lying on its side, the stately vessel now replete
With harbingers of peace, telling lies

Overlooking signs of the spiritual bereavement's cost
Trying to arrive at a destination that they've lost
To ignorance which winks at them and smiles

Listen well
The patience of the people soon will end
Time will tell

Through the sea of man, the captains mad with power pause
And congratulate themselves on the virtuous and noble cause
Which must surely save the world and alter time",The Candidate

Keep in mind the difference between courage and will
Don't be afraid to stop what you've begun

Gives them license to kill

Whatever is said to undo the plan
Consider the source, and ignore it, my friend
You're doing just fine, keep on keepin' on

Extend yourself with caution to the call
And should tomorrow find you moving slowly through the night
Don't let their cries of terror make you fall

Whatever is said to undo the plan

Her remarkably curious eyes
So the shock that she felt didn't show
When I told her that I had to go

She just stood there somewhere in between
A smile and an unpleasant scene
Then she with her back to the sun
Said, ""If you think it's best, then it's done.""

Ah, but oh, it seems so cold
The compassion that I felt just didn't show
I haven't seen her since
And there was much about our parting which seemed amiss

For the love that I felt hadn't died
But by cruel circumstances denied
And her feelings and trust weren't misplaced
Nor are they now in her new lover's face

Michael Nesmith,"She was a lackluster lover
Who thought of another
When I offered her my hand
To help her in out of the rain
Then she became quite possessive
When I gave her the message 
That I had to leave 
On the outbound ten o'clock train 
She said I thought you were stable
And that I might be able
To talk you into sticking around
For a couple of years
I said I roll with the flow
Wherever it goes and it's rolling out of here

There was this didactic minister
Who told me of sinister things 
Which would happen
If I were to do something wrong
He spoke at length about brimstone
And lives that were based on
Belief that the bad and the good
Were equally strong
That's why I think I undid him
When I started to kid him
Cause he said if you'll give me some time
I'll make it quite clear
I said I roll with the flow
Wherever it goes and it's rolling out of here

Now those are two fine examples
Of the way that I handled 
The pressure that tried to draw me away from the light
And in the final analysis
It's foolish if you resist
The changes that come into your everyday life
There might be some trepidation
But don't let hesitation
Deprive you of hope and try to replace it with fear

And he's gone, but perhaps it's for the better
For the stand that you made
With such courage displayed
Lets you laugh in the face of disaster

And your need for such boldness is gone
You're alone and you sigh

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

I saw precious things come into view
And I pored through the files taken off my mental shelf
And dusted off some memories of you
Then I thought about the time when our affair was green
How the phoenix of our love first flapped its silken wings
All the urgency and passion
Of each new day as it happened
And how it all mellowed as it grew

I remembered the times when our laughter would explode
And how you would turn to hide your smile
And the hours of silence while a perfumed candle glowed
And both our thoughts meandered on for miles
I remembered the times I said I really had to go
And I remembered the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you
That it really was a lie
And though you never knew it dear 
I cried

Well it's amazing how time can so softly change your ways
And make you look at things that can't be seen
And how the years that roll by can start you listening 
Not just to what they say
But what they mean

So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied
And if the razor edge of youth-filled love is gone
But we're both a little older
Our relationship has grown
Not just in how it's shaped
But how its shown

Michael Nesmith," was overland touring in my new Ferrari
At just about a hundred and ten
I was on my way home from a sophisticated party
Where I got a little drunk on gin

And as the headlights cast a glow on the road
I heard a voice inside of me
It said, ""You lost the light
And now you're moving through the night
Running from the grand ennui
Running from the grand ennui""

Well, I reached in my pocket and I pulled out the Omega
That was never one second behind
I knew the horse that I was running at the Southern Talladega
Had won for the twenty-second time

And then the countess I was with bent over with a kiss
And put a jeweled hand on my knee
I knew I'd lost the light
And I was moving through the night
Running from the grand ennui
Running from the grand ennui

Well that night passed in a blaze of glory
With the countess and the car both mine
And each day passes with the same old story
But the countess has a brand new line

Yet still at night I am haunted by the fright
And distant memory
Of the day I lost the light
Moving through the night

into yellows and blues and a tune that I could not have sung.

Don't say yes, but please
Don't say no
I don't want to be lonely tonight
 
Go away then, damn you
Go on and do as you please, yeah
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees
I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turning my world upside down
 
Do me wrong, do me right, right now baby
Go on and tell me lies, but hold me tight

Michael Oakland,"Isn't she lovely 
Isn't she wonderful 
Isn't she precious 
Less than one minute old 
I never thought through love we'd be 
Making one as lovely as she 
But isn't she lovely made from love 
Isn't she pretty 
Truly the angel's best 
Boy, I'm so happy 
We have been heaven blessed 
I can't believe what God has done 
Through us he's given life to one 
But isn't she lovely made from love 
Isn't she lovely 
Life and love are the same 
Life is Aisha 
The meaning of her name 
Londie, it could have not been done 
Without you who conceived the one 
That's so very lovely made from love",Isn't She Lovely
Michael Omartian,"Once in your life you'll find her
Someone who turns your heart around
And next thing you know
You're closin' down the town

Wake up and she's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
You're wonderin' to yourself
Hey what've I found

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (the best that you can do)
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does what he pleases
All of his life his master's toys
And deep in his heart
He's just he's just a boy
Livin' his life one day at a time
He's showing himself a really good time
He's laughin' about the way
They want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City

I don't want to lose you, I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreamin' of

I'm always strong when you're beside me

Michael Patrick,"Anything we should know about your change? 
She was a level headed dancer on the road to alcohol
And I was just a soldier on the way to Montreal
Well, she pressed her chest against me
About the time the jukebox broke
She gave me a peck on the back of the neck
And these are the words she spoke

Blow up your T.V., throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try to find Jesus on your own

So I sat there at the table and I acted real naive
'Cause I knew that topless lady
Had something up her sleeve
Well, she danced around the bar room
And she did the hoochy-coo
She sang her song all night long, tellin' me what to do

Blow up your T.V., throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try to find Jesus on your own

Well, I was young and hungry and about to leave that place
When just as I was leavin', well she looked me in the face
I said, \""You must have the answer\""
\""She said, \""No but I'll give it a try\""
And to this very day we've been livin' our way
And here is the reason why

We blew up our T.V., threw away our paper
Moved to the country, built us a home
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their own

Got a new, got a new love and open eyes
Break away, break away the old ways and live high
Got a new course for the light

You picked me up from the depth I couldn’t cope

Michael Paynter,"I remember the time, when I was searching my mind
Just to find out if I ever define who I am,
Could I ever afford to consider being more,
I was sure that I saw all the world, but I keep wishing for more,
So I keep checking my direction, watching my own reflection,
And I'm still, still in connection with the way I wanna be,
Did I behave, 'cause I've been stuck here for days,
I'm in a daze, had the chance to be your savior but I threw it away

What if I dive off the edge of my life and there's nothing beneath?
What if I live like there's nothing to lose just to die on my knees?
At least I know, I walked the door, I took the scars, I risked it all,
And learned to love the fall.

I could never see how it hurts, to feel the worst,
I'll never make it, even though how it hurts,
That I won't be that type of guy that never tried,
That never took a chance, or took his moment to fly to be free,

You may be of the opinion that I'm making a wrong decision,
That I'm giving up the chance to live my life in your vision,
But I can't give up, no I won't give up,
Until you see that okay is never ever enough

What if I dive off the edge of my life and there's nothing beneath?
What if I live like there's nothing to lose just to die on my knees?
( What if I live )
At least I know, I walked the door, I took the scars, I risked it all,
And learned to love the fall.

I'm here,
My hands are cold, my heart is racing,
( Yeah )
The only fear is fear of failing.

What if I dive off the edge off my life and there's nothing beneath?
What if I live like there's nothing to lose just to die on my knees?
At least I know, I walked the door, I took the scars, I risked it all,
And learned to love the fall

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I was 12 when daddy said to me
Don't take to drinking boy that road don't lead no where   
And don't you ever let me hear you swear 
Don't you dare
He told me that stealing's a lazy man's way
Something for nothing leaves you hell to pay so don't buy into it 
and then you can look the whole world in the eye
Honey I've tried
But Since I met you girl I've been breaking every rule
I must confess I'm just a back sliding fool

I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I want to lie here close to you look at what you made me do
Darling you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie

Last night I threw away the 12 step book
I finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you
There's nothing more that I can do  Ain't no use
Cause every time I see your angel face
My halo disappears without a trace  I swear
Girl I'd admit I haven't got a prayer
But I don't care
I know this ain't exactly how I was raised
But heaven help me honey I ain't changing my ways

The fancy full-length fur
Dom Perignon and French cuisine
Don't mean a thing to her
What good is her pedestal
When he works all though the night
So in time, she found a dance floor
And some arms to hold her tight

Now every night they dance with her to some brushes on a drum
A standup bass, and steel guitars, play a tune, she can hum
Ain't it sad, ain't it funny, how a man can be so wrong
He tried to buy her love with money
He could've had her for a song

She wanted him...but what a shame
He didn't realize
Love can never stay the same
It either grows or dies
What made him think his duty was to place her high above
He married her for beauty, she married him for love

No curtains on the windows, just a couple sheets

Ain't no one more committed...I love the single life
If I want to, I can put on my cleanest dirty shirt
Stay out all night for better or worse
Just look what I'd be missin', if I had a wife

I never knew a broken heart
Could turn you inside out
I didn't know, that I didn't know
What love was all about

If she came walking through the front door
There's a million things I say
Like ""I love you"" and ""I missed you, please don't ever go away.""
And if you would just forgive me
I'll be at your beck and call
'Cause it's amazing just how much I've learned
Since I thought I knew it all

Lately evolution theory
Is hitting home a lot more clearly
As our love slowly dies each day
You say this love ain't worth reviving
There's no chance of us surviving
We're doomed to simply fade away

That's what they said about the buffalo
The timber wolf and the eagle too
They made a comeback and I know
So could me and you
Let's get off of love's endangered list
We've got something that this world would miss
I know you're sayin' that there's no hope
That's what they said about the buffalo

We put in too many long nights
Working late and chasing the wildlife
Living like two hard headed fools
It's really not too big a mystery
The reason we are almost history
The talk all over town says we are through

You were all she ever wanted, that was once upon a time
She was all you ever needed, that's what makes it such a crime
How you took her heart for granted, how you threw her love away
Now you still don't understand it, if you did, you'd never say

It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

Just because she never said so, doesn't mean she didn't see
Every time you stole an apple off somebody else's tree
Late last night that lipstick letter she left on the bedroom door
Said ""You don't get it, and you ain't gonna get it anymore!"" 

It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?

This bar has been my home away from her
Used to be, she was missing me
Now she's moving in with her best friend
And I'm the only one who wants what used to be

I'm here because today I lost it all
I didn't want to drink at home alone
I just can't believe all my hopes and dreams are falling
Like a row of dominoes

I thought the man behind the bar
Had heard it all before
My story must have caught him by surprise
'Cause when he handed me my double
There were tears in his eyes
You know you're in trouble
When the bartender cries

He said, ""Last night you swore you'd never drink again""
I said, ""Next time, I'm really gonna try""
So if she ever calls for me
Oh, you can finally tell her, ""He ain't here""
And it won't be a lie

I asked the man behind the bar
What he'd been crying for
He said, ""That bottle used to be a friend of mine
Now I've stopped drinking doubles
But I pour them all of the time
Son, you know you're in trouble
When the bartender cries""

As I saw my own reflection staring back at me, I knew
Every single word he said was true

Well, I told the man behind the bar
I thought I'd seen it all before
Till I saw the sadness in his eyes
That's when I put down my double
And said my last goodbyes
'Cause you know you're in trouble
When the bartender cries
Oh, you know you're in trouble

Get a bucket of Kentucky fried, put twenty in the tank

Michael Powers,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.",Bird on a Wire

Sunset dripping like a candle over the pier
And I’d wish I was here

Gimme a spot, barstool view, bulls eye up on the wall
Ring a smoke, anything goes, a quarter after last call
Halfway gone, petty song, all night long atmosphere
I’d wish I was here

Sleepy head on my chest saying three words
Girl my greener grass is anywhere you're at
By the time I hit the tracks on the edge of town
I’m shifting gears, hitting brakes, turning back around
I could kick up some dust on the road anywhere
But then again I’d just wish I was here

Give me gasoline, seventeen, Carolina coastline
Or that fight song, 4th and long under Friday night lights
Take me back to glory days, any place, any year
I’d wish I was here

Blue eyes all mine in my t-shirt
Sleepy head on my chest saying three words
Girl my greener grass is anywhere you're at
By the time I hit the tracks on the edge of town
I’m shifting gears, hitting brakes, turning back around
I could kick up some dust on the road anywhere
But then again I’d just wish I was here

Gold street white lights when heaven says it’s my turn
Calls me home, all I know, if I got to go first

Blue eyes all mine in my t-shirt
Sleepy head on my chest saying three words
Girl my greener grass is anywhere you're at

Over the shadows and the rain

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

 through the eyes,

And in the movement of an eye
In the telling of a story
In the pouring of two lovers
And in the softness of the moon

I'm standing at the door

So stop running away

I never want to hear you say
I was living out a lie
I'll always want to hear you say
I want you I need you

I never thought I'd find
Someone who will always be there
You know I'm gonna make you mine
You said you'd come back again

I never knew exactly when
Never could accept the pain
All the time I took the blame
I want you I need you

I never thought I'd find
Someone who will always be there
You know I'm gonna make you mine
The day that you came to me

Was the day that changed my world
Those memories are sadder now
Was I to know it would go wrong
No I didn't leave you

But we gotta get back somehow
I never deceived you
So stop running away'
I want you I need you

Michael Schenker,"Laughing in the face of destruction
With nowhere to go
We thought on all the dreams that we had
Then we let them show

We climbed up to the top, but could not see
The skies were a blaze
But after all that was said still we felt shame oh oh
Red sky, red sky at night

Stretched out as far as I could see
Red sky, red sky at night
I felt them coming over me
A shout was the first of the warnings

And then came the rain
Visions were torn from the lies that melted out the sane
They did it for love and gave it for free
Now all the things that are left

Are there for you and me
Red sky, red sky at night
Feeling them reaching over me
That one night, that I saw the light

Wondering what ever could it be
Laughing in the face of destruction
With nowhere to go
We thought on all the dreams that we had

Then we let them show
'Cause they did it for love, and gave it for free
Now all the things that are left
Are there for you and me

Really does the things I like oh oh...
I don't want to let her go

Far from home
Who's gonna rock my nights away!

But all the time she drinks
And never stops to think
It's gonna start all over again
I must be outta my head, how can she love me
If she's leaving my bed

You spoil me, I can't get enough
I need you, don't want to see you again

She always seems to take
But give's me something back in return

Shadows were long as they forged through the night
Looking for signs of the day,
Deep in their minds as they walked out of sight
Leading the hours away
Mission completed all were defeated
Branded with fire, now filled with desire
Message came through on the wings of a prayer
Feelings were high for a time
Slap on the backs for the ones who had dared
To run with the wolves of our time
The heat is on, when victory's won, and your out out in the cold,
The dogs of war, will bite the hand for a price, and then hear them roar

Michael Schenker,"Mister Rock and Roller, you're never gonna die
Out in the washroom, they busted tonight
The blue suited soldiers, with the coke sniffin' hounds
Come out of your nightmares and run you to the ground
Run you to the ground, run you to the ground

How come you never, get wise to what you see
Yesterday's newspapers blankets in the street
Running from your demons, they're out to get your soul
To much human debris, on the sidewalks of world
Sidewalks of the world sidewalks of the world

Run for your life to keep on with the living
'Cause we've all been right and wrong
Holding your ground on your own
The word is out you're going down
And no one will ever know

Look out rock and roller you'll never want to die
They hide in the washroom and bust in tonight
The blue suited soldiers with the coke sniffin' hounds
Come out of your nightmares to run you to the ground
Run you to the ground run you to the ground

Run for your life to keep on with the living
'Cause we've all been right and wrong
Holding your ground on your own
The word is out you're going down

Michael Schenker,"I can't be sure but did I get it right
Yeah! You're watching me
I think you should begin
Start bringing out the man
Let's share the mystery
Can it be you're just playing a little game
I'll never be the same again
Never had a feeling such as this
Lord I'm going overboard
You're like a nuclear division
Coming at me from all sides
About to explode
Can it be you're just leading me astray

Captured by your every move I'm lost
Gotta get myself on course

Where do you always find the time
The explanations I found
Are all based on solid ground
Can nobody get inside

Better to leave it alone
Some things you do disturb me
Better to weather the storm

Follow the signs
And all the things you've seen
Follow the night

Yeah' Find your fantasy
Follow the road that leads you straight to me

You never know where to turn
Look for the space instead
Wonder how you can carry on

From right across the room

We were laughin' at each other's jokes
You knew that I believed in you
Didn't know you'd scare that easy
lnstead of giving me a chance,
You shut me out completely

For our love is indeed

Said you wonna be alone
That you ain't got time for love
But don'f forget who you're talkin' to
I was all of that above
Tell me what you're gonna do
When you wake up felling lonely
Will you pick up the phone and call me
And tell me you've changed your mind
I don't understand. 
I'm a lovin' man
Said I made you feel like nobody else
Can I love you more
Said I found your secret door
Like a thief in the night
You walked out of my life
If it takes a lifetime.
Girl, you know I'm gonna find you
I never would've thought
That you'd leave me behind you

All the time crazy for you
Tell myself, again and again

After all you've said to me

You broke my confidence
Took it all, why well you see
Makes no difference, to you it seems

One more way to face - what is true
Life goes on, what else can I do
You're not here 'cause you don't need me

Never had to worry
Didn't need to care

You laugh when I cry
I'm beginning to see the reason why
Don't go thinking I'll never leave
'Cause you won't be laughin'
You won't believe (You better believe)

Who's gonna hold you
From dark until dawn
And who will be there
That can love you like me
When I'm gone?

Your clothes are hanging on the floor
My room is full of the night before
And the promise you made to love me forever

Oh! You can't use me
Then just up and leave
You got it wrong
You better believe
If I walk out that door
It's forever

And fading in the Arabian sun
You're stallion stands to watch the sun set

And lie beneath the palms and the sky
And spend the night a silver moon set

Burnin' with desert fire, Cooling the man

Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom

With all darkness closin' in
Will the light reveal your soul
One sweet kiss on your clay cold lips
I'll know sleep you'll never know
Where do we go, where do we go
Where do we go from here

Michael Schenker,"Heaven helps
Dreams are shattered
Take my hand
Take my life

When prayers have failed
We're bruised and battered
We'll find that land
We'll leave tonight

Help me see, when I'm blinded
I make your dream pull you through
Make me live, when I'm dying
I spend my days, just for you

One morning, one day
One story, one way

I believe, there's a place for everyone
I believe, we can have it all
We can heal, when we are lost and alone
I believe we can change it all

Lights went on, and blurred my vision
Something knocked me off my feet
It drained the fuel, of my ambition
It left me stranded on the street

One morning, one day
One story, one way

I believe, there's a place for everyone
I believe, we can have it all
We can heal, when we are lost and alone
I believe we can change it all

A little faster every day
A twist of fate, left me yearning
For the one, who lost its way

We can heal, when we are lost and alone

You shine the light on my way
And in the fields of sadness
You plant a seed, that blooms any day

You wake the dead
I'm out of my head
You turn the blue sky red

[Chorus 1]
And I would climb any mountain
Swim any sea
I will be there
To shake your tree
I would hitchhike to heaven
Fly to the sun
I will be there
To bang your drum

Through the tears and the laughter
The river runs to the sea
Through the thirst and hunger
You will give me all that I need

You paint the sky
With blood and desire
You set my heart on fire

[Chorus 2]
And I would climb any mountain
Swim any sea
I will be there
To set you free
I would hitchhike to heaven
Fly to the sun
I will be there
'Cause you're the one

Nowhere to run now
Nowhere to hide from me

In this world we live in
Keep your feet on the ground
Don't give up, don't give in
When there's no more hope to be found

You paint the sky
With blood and desire
You set my heart on fire

I will be there ...",I Will Be There

You can wish upon a star

We all have the right to live
To spend our time hurting,fighting
We all have much more to give

A devil will promise the breath of our fears

Everybody knows that yeah I'm kind of shy,
I'm not the kind of girl that who can ever approach a guy,

And if your free,
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see,
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy.

When I told you that I don't need a man in my life that ties me down,
And don't want a playa that can kiss all over town.
Who's these girl stripping all over my Mercedes seat,
I can stand a man who thinks he looks better than me,
I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun,
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please.

Last thing I need is a man who's soft, 
He better get it on up, and break me off,
Some body fly high, who's 6'5, 
who's shy that's the kind of man I need because I'm free.

Just a cowboy from the good side

Drinking whiskey and talking loud
Rough neck riders they were shooting up the town
A tall dark stranger he made a stand
Grabbed his gun and took the law into his hand

Eyes on fire he rose slowly from his chair
Walked outside and weighed the danger in the air
Seven bullets had the names of seven men
When the smoke cleared he's the only one to stand

[Chorus]
Just a cowboy from the good side
On a page that they left out of history
Just a cowboy from good side
And no one knew his name

He was the hero then it all went black
Out of nowhere someone shot him in the back
But on windy nights when the cactus blooms
You'll see his silhouette against the moon

Torn from the tales of an age

Childhood sweethearts
The neighborhood had all agreed
That we would succeed
With infinite passion

We were so innocent then
Everyone's favorites
Never a moment apart
Waiting for the love
To grow between us

Then one day a cold wind blew
The love got so much older
I didn't see the problem in time
And suddenly it was over

It's over
It's over
It's over

Marriage came quick down the line
The families applauded
Three kids and ten years today
Trying to live the way
They all imagined

Now we're like everyone else
Stripped of the magic
The distance that love could not reach
Higher than the night
As sure as daytime

They're sorry when they're sober

One good reason, why I shouldn't
put someone above you

Look who's going under
Trying to make it last
Don't want to steal your thunder
but the time for saving's past
(It's so far gone)
And all the talk that's going down
well, I never ever bought a line
No reason left to hang around
And I just don't have the time

(CHORUS:)
Ain't nothing you can say now
gonna make me change my mind
All I need is one good reason
Tell me why--why I ought to love you
One good reason
Ya got to give me one

All I need is one good reason
Tell me why, why I ought to love you
One good reason

And I haven't got lines for just a minute or two

When love was new

Can't help rememberin' all of the times
When love was new 
When love was new

We were dancing in the dark

Breaking all the rules

And my lady is sweet, the children are fat
Just in passing, you cross my mind and I look up
All about the time...

When we were dancing in the dark

Just a couple of fools
Holding you close and
Breaking all the rules
Doesn't everything get covered by those first love's blues

You can change it any way with ease
As I'm sitting here and thinking of you 
Do you know what I really need?

So hard to ignore our mutual interest
And your arresting eyes

Drop your robe to the floor
Let me kiss your insides
I know ecstasy hides deep in you
Allow me to explore your mystery
Set our souls free

Been drinkin' with the sailor boy
Been tryin' hard to understand
Lines here in my hand

Tried so hard, the smile on my face

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Is a love I can be sure of

It could be me
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all
It should be me, it could be me

Wandering through life will love come home to you
And the love you want forever, will they be true to you

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time

It should be me, it could be me

Where does it stop where do you dare me to draw the line
You've got the body now you want my soul
Don't even think about it say no go",Sunrise

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin

All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see

I could breathe this air forever cause I feel you in this place
Never thought I'd live alone by the time I was 33
Guess I was wrong but that ain't a new thing to me
I'd rather be right just like anybody else, but I still have to live with myself

Well you know I'd rather be lost in love instead of found
You can see I've followed love all around
There's something in me that can never get enough
It's a funny kind of thing, first I'm down then I'm up
I wish somebody could explain the light of love

The light of love is somewhere waiting
Lose the breath you're saving
Feel like celebrating for love
I should have known the world was saying
Raise your head its raining
Some day boy you'll see there's enough

This is some kind of day, I thought it was summer in July
But so much rain, it's like a cold winter sky
I'd love it this way if I wasn't here alone
Have another glass of wine and let her go

I'm alone ooh I'm lonely as I hear the seabirds call
Seven islands sail before me
I guess I'm not alone at all

Well you know I'd rather be lost in love instead of found
You can see I've followed love all around

Michael Tomlinson,"I used to think I would one day settle down
I don't know what that really means
I'm in a place where the dream
Comes back around
To look me right in the face
I dream of love like it was before but
That kind of love seemed to never stay
Yet it still has a hold on me today

Sometimes I want to lay these troubles down
Turn around and then walk away
But I believe that I know too much now
I can't pretend I'm the same
Some love lives to cut and scrape us
Some love come to help us feel
Some love, so we'll all begin to heal

Whenever I feel alone like this
I lay awake uneasily
I need more than a lover's sweet kiss
Romance will not deliver me
I hear and old and endless song
The words I just keep filling
I keep thinking the love we need
Will live again

There are things when we're young
That we all learn
To gorw up and just never ask
How is it that a world that doesn't work
Has ended up on our backs
Sometimes I can see right through this
Sometimes I'm no more than blind
Stumbling in the darkness of my mind

In a world that we don't even
Begin to understand
There's a storm that we're living in
Can we learn to live in trust

Michael Tomlinson,"I see you out on the street in your cars
People hurting, smouldering, burning
And all it is, is that we don't know who we are
Hard and hurried, tired of the journey

Life goes on and the veil doesn't lift
If we're still learning
Why does it take so long
It seems to me that there will be

A better way
Through these dark and desperate days
We've been down and we've been out
We've been broken on the ground

We've all been left and spun around
Yeah, we all know the stifled sound
Of life gone dry

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

Never quite got said
Now the time is gone
We're moving on
Even though it hurts so bad

If I could
I'd turn back the days
And I'd love again
To be your friend
In a hundred different ways

But we can't turn back the time
The days

So if I never said, all I needed to say
I'll say it now
You know I loved you once
I love you stronger than day
Please love, find me a way
Words, I still need to say
But I don't know how

Can't stand still
Still I can't move on
Lord, I need your strength
Need you and me
'Cause a part of me is gone

In time, I will know
What I've yet to see
That through all the pain
You hurt the same
And you're standing here with me

More than anything it's you
I need

So if I never said, all I needed to say
I'll say it now
You know I loved you once
I love you stronger than day
Please love find me a way
Words, I still need to say
Please show me how

So if I never said, all I needed to say

Michael W. Smith,"On the day
You were saved
Heaven and hell marked you down
Angels praise
Devils raged
Life became a battleground
So when hell starts to move
And the enemy marches on you
Hang on, it's a fight
You've been marked by the army of night
You're a target

When your heart
Loved the dark
Hell could just leave you alone
With your life
Filled with light
You have become quite a foe

So when hell starts to move
And the enemy marches on you
Hang on, it's a fight
It's a battle of darkness and light

[Chorus:]
When things get bad and you can't stand to look
It's time to read to the end of the book
Don't put it down 'til you get to the end
When Jesus come and His Kingdom begins
'Til He comes
God the Son
Teaches us to use the sword
And every fight
Has a light
When you know we win the war

So when hell starts to move
And the enemy marches on you
Hang on, it's a fight
You're a part of the army of light

Found between the truth and me

And make a way to find a way to soothe my mind

There is a way that might seem right to me
A dim reflection of what's good
Just an illusion of the best that I can be

Out in the city heat
Always a party there
Along the sordid street
And it was guaranteed
The place to be was Rocketown
The drinks were two for one
Inside the crowded bars
The girls would make their run
Out on the boulevard
It was the idol place
We lived the ways of Rocketown
Hang around by the street light
In the heart of the night life

There came a certain man
A stranger to the crowd
We didn't understand
What he was all about
He walked a different pace
So out of place in Rocketown

They made a fool of him
They teased him when he'd speak
But when they knocked him down
He'd turn the other cheek
He told me I could find
A life outside of Rocketown
Hang around by the street light
In the heart of the night life

What was his mission
Where was he going
Why was his heart light
Always glowing
All I was missing
He stood there holding
What was his secret
Could I know it

Some laughed and turned away
But me, I longed to hear

I could feel the emptiness

Michael W. Smith,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa

From outside looking at the ""In Crowd""

They look mighty fine, a sight to behold
But all that glitters is not gold
(Still those voices are calling you)

[Chorus]
All you're missin' is a heartache
A disillusion for a keepsake
A life of living with your own mistake
All you're missin' is a heartache

The water is high, you're out on a limb
Well, if you take the fall then it's ""sink or swim""

You're kissing the dark
You're courting your pride
You wonder is it greener on the other side

See it laying down the cornerstone
The Hand of Providence, it's evident
For we could never make it on our own
Apportioning the power
Weighing all that it entails
Giving us the fulcrum
And a balance to the scales

Oh, the Hand of Providence
Is guiding us through choices that we make
Oh, the Hand of Providence
Is reaching out to help us on our way

Providence, ever since
Any thesis ever entered man
The Hand of Providence
Has been our best defense
Tho' his ways are sometimes hard to understand
From the dying of a heartbeat
To another soul reborn
From in between and circling

Or it can be a paradox
To seek solace in your solitude

I'll be right here by your side
So whenever your need be
Know that you can lean on me

I'll help you find your way
I'll help you find your way
When you're lost in all the madness
When you're blinded by your doubt
When you need someone to be there for you
I'll help you find your way

Don't keep your thoughts
Locked behind your cellar door
All shrouded in a mystery
Just let them out
That's what friends are for
To give without giving the ""third degree""
No need to be ashamed
I've been through' it just the same
So when your path misleads
Know that you can call on me

She was living here
Yea, she was living here

And losing one you love is like a storm

Singing in heaven tonight
And in between the sadness
I hear Leesha
Telling me that she's alright

Life goes on even after life
That's what I believe
Yea, that's what I believe
Leesha's gone, but she will still survive
In a memory that I'm keeping here with me
Silencing the voice of mortal tragedy
Listening to whispers of the soul
All is peaceful

Michael W. Smith,"Once a true believer
Once there was a fire in your soul
You were the epitome of blessed faith astir
With thirst for holiness
And hunger for the Word
Now you move in other circles
To the beat of different drums
And I see only glimpses of the one you used to be
The inspiration that you were to me'

[Chorus]
I miss the way His love would dance within your eyes
I miss the way His heart was the soul of your life
And somewhere in the saddest part of heaven's room
Our Father sheds a tear for you
He's missing you, too

Some are calling you a prodigal
Some aren't calling you at all
But far away someone is calling you back home
Do you hear it anymore out there on your own

Michael W. Smith,"Never should have tasted that forbidden fruit
Tell me why do I always do
What I don't want to do
Now, I'm the only reaper of the seeds that I sow
And when I walk the field of my stubborn will
It's a hard row to hoe
There's a price for getting smarter
So I pay what I owe
While bridges burn
Let the shadow fall behind me
I am wiser I know
We live and learn
Always living and learning
Always living and learning
Is it out of the fire, back in to the pan
Is once enough to let it all sink in-or will I do it again
A time for understanding has now come of age
So I heed the word of the counselor and the voice of the sage
Try to see the meaning
Read between every line
When pages turn
There'll be no room for explaining what has been well-defined
We live and learn
Always living and learning
Always living and learning

An engaging temptation had me doing time
Cause when it starts a fire under strong desire
We are partners in crime
But hindsight is clearer
I can where I've gone and never return
It's a new man in the mirror
It's a new freedom song to live and learn
Always living and learning
Always living and learning",Live and Learn
Michael W. Smith,"I'm not how I used to be
When we hung around
Back when it was you and me

I am not the same

And you wonder where I've gone
Well, I've found where I belong
I'm on the other side
True, I used to walk your shore
But I'm not there anymore
I'm on the other side

Years fade like the setting sun
Turning us loose
They give us many ways to run
And many roads to choose
Well, I ran into saving grace
Headed for nowhere
Love showed me another place
And brought me there

Here is where we realize
The sculpting of the Father's great design
Through' time you've been a friend to me
But time is now the enemy
I wish we didn't have to say goodbye
But I know the road He chose for me
Is not the road he chose for you
So as we chase the dreams we're after

Pray for me and I'll pray for you
Pray that we will keep the common ground
Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you
And one day love will bring us back around again

Painted on our tapestry
We see the way it has to be
Weaving through' the laughter and the tears
But love will be the tie that binds us
To the time we leave behind us
Memories will be our souvenirs
And I know that through' it all
The hardest part of love is letting go
But there's a greater love that holds us

Pray for me and I'll pray for you
Pray that we will keep the common ground
Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you
And one day love will bring us back around again",Pray for Me

Teaching new ways
Each word winning them over
Each heart a kindled flame
Old men watch from the outside
Guarding their prey
Threatened by the voice of the paragon
Leading their lambs away
Leading them far away

Nobody knew His claim to fame
He broke the old rules steeped in tradition
He tore the holy veil away
Questioning those in powerful position
Running to those who called His name
But nobody knew His secret ambition
Was to give His life away

His rage shaking the temple
His word to the wise
His hand healing on the seventh day
His love wearing no disguise
Some say, ""Death to the radical
He's way out of line.""
Some say, ""Praise be the miracle
God sends a blessed sign.
A blessed sign for troubled times.""

Go west young man
When the evil go east
Go west young man
Go west young man

Well I don't know
But I'm asking for the will to fight
To wear the crown of life

Who can tell you what is going on
It seems we have become the generation
Of wars and bombs
And the heart grows weak
And the fear grows strong

And you want to run
But you don't know where
So where do you go
I know
And I tell you

I am sure there will be a day
But it will not be like the nations say
The Lord will come when this life is through
And His deep desire is to be with you
Hearts will fly when the new world starts
And joy will rise like the morning star
God will meet every cry of the heart
And it's my prayer
I want you to be there

I like to think about the new creation
Things that God will do
So every now and then I stop and close my eyes
I enjoy the view
And the heart grows strong
And the fear grows weak
And I cannot wait for the new world to come to me
And while I dream
Oh, I pray for you
Cause He wants you to go
I know
And I tell you

Fade into the cold night
Don't know where to turn
I don't know where to turn

Seem to lose their meaning

Baby, let me in your world
All you need is someone you can hold
Don't be sad, you're not alone

I will be here for you
Somewhere in the night
Somewhere in the night
I'll shine a light for you
Somewhere in the night
I'll be standing by
I will be here for you

In this world of strangers
Of cold and friendly faces
Someone you can trust
Oh there's someone you can trust
I will be your shelter
I'll give you my shoulder
Just reach out for my love
Reach out for my love
Call my name and my heart will hear
I will be there, there's nothing to fear

Michael W. Smith,"Sun comes up Sunday morn 
On the little church where I been since I was born 
And there he stood a hearty smile 
You could hear his voice ringing out for a country mile 

And he could place your mind at ease 
With his tenderness and a heart 
That aimed to please 
A pauper's hands a farmer's clothes 
Just a preacher man we called Kentucky Rose 

He worked the soul like he worked the land 
He spoke in ways that anyone could understand 
Simple words of simple faith 
And when it came to love 
He would go out of his way 

A helping hand 
A soothing chat 
And he practiced what he preached imagine that 
And as far as kindness goes 
There was none compared to old Kentucky Rose 

Evening stroll 'cross Shyler's bridge 
That's when he saw the boy 
Trapped below that rocky ridge 
He knew the danger he would face 
But it's as if he saved the child 
Only to take his place 

For on that ridge of stone and ice 
Kentucky met his maker in a sacrifice 
Why he's gone 
God only knows 
Maybe for the company of his Kentucky Rose 

So peaceful in his Sunday best 
He was buried on a hill and laid to rest 
When people heard they came in droves 
To say their last good-byes to sweet Kentucky Rose 

Now, on that hill 
One flower grows 
They say it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose
They say it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose 
I believe it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose",Kentucky Rose

And media pressure

If you don't look like a paper doll 

In a world where the goal is 
To be like the Joneses 
It's guaranteed to drive you wild 
Keeping up with the latest style 
Gaze in the mirror 
You want the glamour 
And the grace of a movie star 
But I like you the way you are 
You are the only one I'm dreamin' of

Breathing in the lifeline
Angels in waiting
Gone before they could be given wings to fly

With truest of intentions
And yet they're jaded by
Hypocrisies behind cathedral walls

What of the humble and the meek that knew despair
And never got their moment
But sacrificed a life of comfort
So that others knew no pain

Whatcha had to know - 'n what it's all about
When you started to move - just a step at a time
You never wanted to fall

Are ya way at the top - afraid of somethin' you found
Then you try to go back - not as easy to do
Did you find who you are

Watch it count down to the end of the day

This is where you need to be

All the days that you've been spending
Spinning while your heart's descending
Like a stone in the ocean
Sometimes when you think the world is ending
It's really just a new beginning
The other side of emotion

But I've seen your eyes
No compromise
When you set your mind on the matter
Be strong through the tears
And your sight will clear
You're gonna get what you're after

[Chorus]

Don't be surprised when the road divides
Just take the one less traveled by

[Chorus]",Don't Give Up
Michael W. Smith,"Where's the Navigator of your destiny?
Where is the Dealer of this hand?
Who can explain life and its brevity
Cause there is nothing here that I can understand

You and I have barely met
And I just don't want to let go of you yet

[Chorus]
Noah, hello, goodbye
I will see you on the other side
Noah, sweet child of mine
I will see you on the other side

And so I hold your tiny hand in mine
For the hardest thing I've ever had to face
Heaven calls for you before it calls for me
When you get there, save me a place

A place where I can share your smile
And I can hold you for more than just a while

[Chorus]","Hello, Goodbye"
Michael W. Smith,"Once upon a time
I was faithless, strutting blind
Through the valley of the lost
So now you find it rather strange
When you hear me claim the name
Of the one who bears the cross, and I say

[Chorus]
I believe in You now
A new light is showing me how
I used to walk in the shadows of doubt
But I believe in you now

Will there ever come a day
When you follow in the way
Of the truth that sets you free?
To where the thunder of a voice
And the echo of a choice
Will bring you to your knees
No longer running through the night
A conversion to the light
Giving way to disbelief, and you say

[Chorus]",I Believe in You Now
Michael W. Smith,"Who is the you that no one else can see
In your heart, a lonely one afraid to be
Lost again, need a friend

You hide your soul to keep the hurt inside
All alone, your tears call out into the night
Is He there, does He care

[Chorus]
Yes, I know your name
Every prayer you pray
I'm the One Who brought you to this place
The Voice Who sings to you
The Hand that clings to you
Oh My child, I've always known your name, known your name

I hold you close to me, close to heart
And this kind of love will find you anywhere you are
Never fear, I am here

[Chorus]",I Know Your Name
Michael W. Smith,"I really want to see you
I really want to touch you
If only I could hold you in my arms again
I really want to reach you
Forever to be with you
If only I could hold you in my arms again

It was written in the stars
On the pages of my heart
Oh, that someday I would find
The love I feel for you tonight

On the ocean of our dreams
Like a prayer you came to me
And the longing that had been
Found its ending in your eyes
And I am missing you tonight

I really want to see you
I really want to touch you
If only I could hold you in my arms again
I really want to reach you
Forever to be with you
If only I could hold you in my arms again

Across the waves, across the sea
Separating you from me
Here's a promise and it's mine
I will love you for all time
I'm wishing you were here tonight

I really want to see you
I really want to touch you
If only I could hold you in my arms again
I really want to reach you
Forever to be with you
If only I could hold you in my arms again",In My Arms Again
Michael W. Smith,"I'm looking at you, old friend of mine
There's no use pretending that everything's fine
Now don't be so brave, don't be so proud
I want you to know that I'm here for you now

I can see you hurting and it's hurting me
It doesn't have to be this way

[Chorus]
(Somebody gonna hold your head up)
If you let me hold you closer
(Somebody gonna show you the light)
Let me know you
(Somebody gonna hold your head up)
Let me show you the way
(Somebody gonna see you right)

I'm feeling for you, feeling so much
When this heart is big enough for the both of us
I'll give you my love if you give me your pain
I'll hold it inside of me 'till you're stronger again

Well, I hate seeing you so far away
When not a word can say it enough

[Chorus]

I'll be your rock for this day
When I hear you calling out my name
Cause I know you'd only do the same for me

[Chorus]",Let Me Show You the Way
Michael W. Smith,"If I could, I would tell you why
The first time I saw her I could touch the sky
I turned to stone, and I could not speak
She had the ability to make me weep

Always wishing, always hoping
That she'll get the message from the bottom of my heart
Let's together share forever
It's just a matter of time

I had to wait and just let her breathe
That's never been easy for a man to see
She moved slow and she took her time
She kept me guessing what was on her mind

Always wishing, always hoping
That you'd get the message from the bottom of my heart
Let's forever be together
It's just a matter of time",Matter of Time
Michael W. Smith,"I have been unfaithful
I have been unworthy
I have been unrighteous
And I have been unmerciful

I have been unreachable
I have been unteachable
I have been unwilling
And I have been undesirable

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I have been unwise
I've been undone by what I'm unsure of
But because of you, and all that you went through
I know that I have never been unloved

I have been unbroken
I have been unmended
I have been uneasy
And I've been unapproachable

I've been unemotional
I've been unexceptional
I've been undecided
And I have been unqualified

[Chorus]

Unaware, I have been unfair
I've been unfit for blessings from above
But even I can see the sacrifice you made for me
To show that I have never been unloved",Never Been Unloved
Michael W. Smith,"The longing in my heart has stirred a faded memory
Of my young heart beating fast behind the willow tree
I was counting out loud, and I only peeked a time or two
And the only purpose in my life was finding you
Singing, ""Ollie, ollie, everybody free!""
Now was I chasing you or were you chasing me?

We all grow up and put away our childhood games
But deep inside I wonder if we really change
'Cause I'm still seeking, though I've learned to hide so well
And I can still remember how it felt
Singing, ""Ollie, ollie, everybody free!""
Will I ever find someone pursuing me?

And then you caught me by surprise
I found my tears are in your eyes
I hear my heart inside of you
At last I've found somebody who
Can free my soul
And love me too

I can't believe we hide so long and run so well
When all the while we're aching to be caught and held
But it's only in surrender that our freedom comes
And so I run abandoned to your waiting arms
Singing ""Ollie, ollie, everybody free!""
I belong to you and you belong to me!

Singin' ""Ollie, ollie, everybody free",Everybody Free
Michael W. Smith,"Hey you
Things to do
Live the life for faith and family
It's tough
With all that stuff
Filling your head
We know
The undertow
Could get us so we don't remember, but
Lest we ever
Lest we ever forget

Hey you, it's me
True lovers are we
Children under the sun
Two spirits in the name of One

Hey me
Got to be
Places to go and people there to see
No space
For back to base
And no time at all
We talk
Walk the walk
Run the race
And climb the ladder, but
If we ever
If we ever should fall

Sometimes the smoke clears
And I see things how they are
I see how we have come so far",Hey You It's Me
Michael W. Smith,"Said it's sad, said it was a shame
Bet you thought I caught a boat to Bombay
On the line just to let you know
I will be around

Underneath the bridge to nowhere
Like I'm livin' out a game of solitaire
Goin' up to a better day
I will be around

Hey world, it's me
I still have the heart, still have the dream

Come on, people
We've got to come together
It's you and me
Hope will make us stronger
Freedom it rings
Do you hear it calling
Reach out and touch
And love will take us higher

Somebody threw a brick at my vision
Tried to sabotage my mission
Either way, I believe
I will be around

I want to know, people are you with me
Open up your heart and just believe 
Take a step, let me hear you say
I will be around

To give you a future, and a hope",I Still Have the Dream
Michael W. Smith,"I see you smiling at me
And I fall into a daydream
Don't know what all of this means
Oh, is it love?
Logic is slipping away
My heart's on a runaway train 

I'm gone, yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone and
It feels so right 

Each time I look in your eyes
So glad you came into my life
Much more than an emotional high
Oh, this is love
I know that I've made up my mind
I'll stay for the rest of my life",I'm Gone
Michael W. Smith,"Another million miles from the Truth now
I know there's peace but I can't seem
To figure out how
To stop this race that's taking over me
I'm under the gun I wait for You to see

Oh, please reach out to me
Open my eyes to see
I'm running from you now
Come rescue me somehow

Another scar from fighting the Truth now
Has left me like a stranger to my need now
A masquerade, a game to figure out now
A cruel charade I cannot scream aloud

A narrow stretch of road in the way now
A heavy load still hanging on to me now
I'm in a maze that I can't seem to get out
Without a view from these shoulders of doubt",Reach Out to Me
Michael W. Smith,"From the first breath of her life
She flew straight into my arms
I used to catch her from the swings
When she was five
And now she dances on the wind
In a world as hard as stone
She's so anxious to begin
And ready to fly

And she walks with me
And she talks with me
And I hold her hand in mine
I know she'll find her way
Like the light of day
Cause it's love that makes her strong

Though I cannot stop the rain
And I cannot turn the tide
And I am sure there will be things 
That break her heart
I can only let her know
I am always on her side
And even as I let her go
I'll never be far

And she walks with me
And she talks with me
In her eyes I see her truth
Born of her fire and grace
As she finds her place
Cause it's love that makes her strong

And she walks with me
And she talks with me
In my eyes she'll see my prayer
As she turns each page
Through this tender age
It is love that makes her strong
It's her love that makes her strong",She Walks With Me
Michael W. Smith,"It was a test that we could all hope to pass
But none of us would want to take

You've stared at the sun,
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one.

Sometimes I need you naked,
Sometimes I need you wild,
I need you to carry my children in
And I need you to kill a child.

You know who I am

If you should ever track me down
I will surrender there
And I will leave with you one broken man
Whom I will teach you to repair.

It's coming nearer to this old town.
Rich and poor, weak and strong
It's bringing mercy, it won't be long.

Healing rain is coming down
It's coming closer to the lost and found.

Are washed forever in Jesus' name.

Healing rain, it comes with fire
So let it fall and take us higher.
Healing rain, I'm not afraid
To be washed in Heaven's rain.

Lift your heads, let us return
To the mercy seat where time began.
And in your eyes I see the pain.
Come soak this dry heart with healing rain.
And only you, the Son of Man
Can take a leper and let him stand.
So lift your hands, they can be held
By someone greater, the Great I Am.

Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware

Maybe there's a place where we will fly
But some, say God is dead like Nietzsche said
And faith has made me a fool

But maybe there is more than meets the eye
Who's that stranger, there, beside you?
Don't be smug and don't be cruel
Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware

Battles of the heart and of the mind
We stay caught in mental purgatory
'Til our existence can be defined

Meanwhile on the shores of parallel
There may be a holy conference held somewhere
Discussing all mankind
Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware

I say maybe we are entertaining angels unaware

To the light that leads to where You are
Now I've acquired these callouses
With the darkness of a cold and jaded heart

So breathe in me, I need You, now
I've never felt so dead within
So breathe in me, maybe somehow
You can breathe new life in me again

Michael W. Smith,"I was throwing away what I needed most
It was the father, son, and the holy ghost
A little carnal knowledge is a dangerous thing
It'll eat a hole in the brain

I'd be the biggest fool in the whole universe
To trade a heavenly blessing for a worldly curse
I was a weaker man till I made my stand
Now I am here to make a change

I'm running blind on the wheels of faith
Moving to the beat of a heart that prays
Hanging on every word you said
I get a little stronger every day

Ain't gonna find any help on the TV
Or written down on the pages of People magazine
It takes digging a little deeper into the good book now
For a little sacred advice

I'm running blind on the wheels of faith
Moving to the beat of a heart that prays
Hanging on every word you said
I get a little stronger every day

Getting strong, stronger now, every day
Getting strong, stronger now, every day
I'm getting stronger

I'm running blind on the wheels of faith
Moving to the beat of a heart that prays
Hanging on every word you said

Michael W. Smith,"Where's the Navigator of your destiny?
Where is the Dealer of this hand?
Who can explain life and its brevity?
'Cause there is nothing here that I can understand

You and I have barely met
And I just don't want to let go of you yet

Noah, hello, good-bye
I'll see you on the other side
Noah, sweet child of mine
I'll see you on the other side

And so I hold your tiny hand in mine
For the hardest thing I've ever had to face
Heaven calls for you before it calls for me
When you get there save me a place

A place where I can share your smile
And I can hold you for more than just awhile

Michael W. Smith,"Sometimes I wonder if my beating heart has a reason
The thought of breathing only takes my breath away
I've spent so many nights wrestling with this feeling
Do I have the strength to make it through the day
But I was never meant
To walk this road alone
I can always trust you
When you say

I will carry you
Be your strength
And pull you through
Reach for me
And take my hand
We will pray
And we will stand
In a world
Crying out for peace
Let your heart be strong
For when I am weak
You will carry me

Sometimes you wonder if the road you're on has a reason
It's hard to go on when you just don't know
We can shoulder all the weight of life between us
Until the fear of what we cannot see is gone
Cause we were never meant
To walk this road alone
We are bound together
When we say

I will carry you
Be your strength
And pull you through
Reach for me
And take my hand
We will pray
And we will stand
In a world
Crying out for peace
Let your heart be strong
For when I am weak

Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook and feel the gentle breeze

How great Thou art, how great Thou art?
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee

Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on that cross my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

How great Thou art, how great Thou art?
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee

And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart?
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art?

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees
I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turning my world upside down
 
Do me wrong, do me right, right now baby
Go on and tell me lies, but hold me tight
Save your good-byes for the morning light, morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely tonight
No, no, I don't want to be lonely tonight

Michael Winkle,"You were my adored one
Then you became the bored one
I was like a toy
That brought you joy one day
A broken toy
That you preferred to throw away

If I expected love
When we first kissed
Blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist
Blame it on my youth
I believed in everything
Like a child of three
You meant more than anything
All the world to me

If you were on my mind
All night and day
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth
If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on the stars
Don't blame it on your smile
Don't blame it on my eyes
Blame it on my youth",Blame It on My Youth
Michael Winkle,"I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

[Chorus:]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

[Chorus]

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love
Michael Winkle,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Michael Wolff,"It was the third of September; that day I'll always remember, 
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, ""Son, 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""

Michael Wolff,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song

Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Michael Wolff,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

This time before you run to her

I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(think it over) haven't I been good to you?
(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over

Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is

And if I were a salad,

While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.

Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.

Dans le meilleur des mondes
De ces tours qui s'effondrent
Devenant poussière et haine

J'ai pleuré sur leurs morts
J'avoue, j'ai de la peine
A croire qu'on est encore
Encore humains

Et je veux vivre libre
Je veux mourir libre
Je veux prier libre
Ce qui nous rend éternel

Je veux vivre libre
Mourir libre

Michal Kwiatkowski,"j'dis pas que j'aime pas
les caresses les draps de soie
la douceur d'une rose

mais j'aime bien aussi quand ça fait mal
quand le cuir est entamé
j'aime aussi les nuits sans étoiles
quand on fait n'importe quoi
j'aime bien le miel

Michal Urbaniak,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Michal Urbaniak,"Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning when you find your heart a home
I've see it in the movies read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it but your touch was all it took

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic 'till you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer I'll be drowning in your eyes
You're the one I needed most when my love was on the line
I'm so glad you gave me yours when I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
You're the only one who could break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good

To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you'll know for sure that

Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver

Michal Urbaniak,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Michal Urbaniak,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song

I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last

I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast

And when I knew I'd have face another day.
Lord, it made me feel so tired.
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind.
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it.
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it.
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for,
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more.

You make me feel like a natural woman.

Qui mettez tant de grâce a vous retirer du jeu
Il faut qu'une main posée sur votre épaule
Vous pousse vers la vie, cette main tendre et légère

On a tous quelque chose en nous de Tennessee
Cette volonté de prolonger la nuit
Ce désir fou de vivre une autre vie
Ce rêve en nous avec ses mots à lui

Quelque chose de Tennessee
Cette force qui nous pousse vers l'infini
Y a peu d'amour avec tell'ment d'envie
Si peu d'amour avec tell'ment de bruit

Ainsi vivait Tennessee
Le cœur en fièvre et le corps démoli
Avec cette formidable envie de vie
Ce rêve en nous c'était son cri à lui

Quelque chose de Tennessee
Comme une étoile qui s'éteint dans la nuit
A l'heure où d'autres s'aiment à la folie
Sans un éclat de voix et sans un bruit
Sans un seul amour, sans un seul ami

Ainsi disparut Tennessee
A certaines heures de la nuit
Quand le cœur de la ville s'est endormi
Il flotte un sentiment comme une envie
Ce rêve en nous, avec ses mots à lui

Quelque chose de Tennessee
Oh oui Tennessee
Y a quelque chose en nous de Tennessee

Michel Camilo,"Plan in motion I must succeed but replaced by stagnate conformity
Oh hear me I cry inside but pride consumes me where balance is
Designed to make
To make us whole but grace
Feeds this red flame

Separation to cleanse provides answered questions of where salvation lies
Oh fill me with this perfection
In waves of humble sight
Trinity cut rebuild reborn
And through this vision

The taste of, salt that, I feel aching, I claw ,and scrape, to compel
Myself to take a stand and walk above this
This fear embraces nothing
Reject this blindness from sight endure recede
Glory and so I let all I am
Let go release your hands
Renews completes

The sickness in me I give away is ready
To resist these hands held out to me to refuse in my confession the
Collapse of my condition
The stale air becomes thin with each breath I receive I'm invoked
Into this spirit invoked into this spirit

Makes me whole
Beneath
Light that
Shines though
Empty
I was
Will be
No more is free

Takes this pawn I know that this is trying, calling upon
Takes my prayers I know that this is calling upon you
Now that I know this strength in me I see past it I'll go past it
Always am I will decide from within
Blessed and born eternal life grace from him to me forever",From Within

Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world, ages old

The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace

Michel Conte,"Les étoiles étaient dans le ciel
Toi dans les bras de Gabriel
Il faisait beau, c'était dimanche
Les cloches allaient bientôt sonner
Et tu allais te marier
Dans ta première robe blanche
L'automne était bien commencé
Les troupeaux étaient tous rentrés
Et parties toutes les sarcelles
Et le soir au son du violon
Les filles et surtout les garçons
T'auraient dit que tu étais belle

Évangeline, Évangeline

Mais les Anglais sont arrivés
Dans l'église ils ont enfermé
Tous les hommes de ton village
Et les femmes ont dû passer
Avec les enfants qui pleuraient
Toute la nuit sur le rivage
Au matin ils ont embarqué
Gabriel sur un grand voilier
Sans un adieu, sans un sourire
Et toute seule sur le quai
Tu as essayé de prier
Mais tu n'avais plus rien à dire

Évangeline, Évangeline

Alors pendant plus de vingt ans
Tu as recherché ton amant
À travers toute l'Amérique
Dans les plaines et les vallons
Chaque vent murmurait son nom
Comme la plus jolie musique
Même si ton cœur était mort
Ton amour grandissait plus fort
Dans le souvenir et l'absence
Il était toutes tes pensées
Et chaque jour il fleurissait
Dans le grand jardin du silence

Évangeline, Évangeline

Tu vécus dans le seul désir
De soulager et de guérir
Ceux qui souffraient plus que toi-même
Tu appris qu'au bout des chagrins
On trouve toujours un chemin
Qui mène à celui qui nous aime
Ainsi un dimanche matin
Tu entendis dans le lointain
Les carillons de ton village
Et soudain alors tu compris
Que tes épreuves étaient finies
Ainsi que le très long voyage

Évangeline, Évangeline

Devant toi était étendu
Sur un grabat un inconnu
Un vieillard mourant de faiblesse
Dans la lumière du matin
Son visage sembla soudain
Prendre les traits de sa jeunesse
Gabriel mourut dans tes bras
Sur sa bouche tu déposas
Un baiser long comme ta vie
Il faut avoir beaucoup aimé
Pour pouvoir encore trouver
La force de dire merci

Évangeline, Évangeline

Il existe encore aujourd'hui
Des gens qui vivent dans ton pays
Et qui de ton nom se souviennent
Car l'océan parle de toi
Les vents du sud portent ta voix
De la forêt jusqu'à la plaine
Ton nom c'est plus que l'Acadie
Plus que l'espoir d'une patrie
Ton nom dépasse les frontières
Ton nom c'est le nom de tous ceux
Qui malgré qu'ils soient malheureux
Croient en l'amour et qui espèrent

I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

You know I'm yours for the very taking

Michel de Villers,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me

Et ce soir les roses m'ennuient

Il est fatigué, le prince charmant
Il est fatigué, son beau cheval blanc
Ses rêves bleus sont un peu gris
Son épée d'or est en fer blanc

Je ne parle pas avec les oiseaux
Mais je parle avec les hommes
Et c'est parfois le chant le plus beau
Mon coeur n'écrit pas
Un roman-photo
Certains soirs, le rôle m'ennuie
Et ce soir, le rôle m'ennuie

J'étais prisonnier
Je suis délivré
De la prison de coton
Que j'habitais depuis des années
J'ai tout fabriqué, je me suis trompé
Mais je t'aime, pardonne-moi
Si tu m'aimes alors aime-moi!

And brought them all together for one night

I'll begin to reach my prime.

You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.

Nous réveillerons la terre entière
Et demain, nos matins chanteront

Trempa sa plume dans le sang

De mourir quand on a vingt ans

Au ventre rond au ventre blanc

Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

Mais je suis seul dans l'univers
J'ai peur du ciel et de l'hiver
J'ai peur des fous et de la guerre
J'ai peur du temps qui passe, dis

Ce sauveur de l'humanité

Comment peut on vivre sans lui?
Sous quelle étoile, dans quel pays?

D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

Mais j'en ai marre d'être roulé
Par des marchands de liberté
Et d'écouter se lamenter
Ma gueule dans la glace, dis
Est-ce que je dois montrer les dents?
Est-ce que je dois baisser les bras?

Que l'on griffonne
Sur la nappe en papier

Michel Fugain,"Bluesy, c'est bluesy, une ville la nuit. 
A l'heure où les rues sont désertes, et sous la pluie, 
Y'a des néons qui pleurent sous la flotte, 
Couleurs qui clignotent, 
Sans savoir pourquoi ni pour qui. 
Moi, le cœur dans les étoiles, 
J'arrive place Pigalle. 
Je suis tout seul, tout seul à Paris sous la pluie. 

Et c'est là que je me dis: 
""C'est tout con, mais je suis heureux. 
Faut pas que je joue avec le feu. 
J'ai presque tout, j'ai presque trop, j'aurai pas mieux."" 
C'est pas sérieux. 
Mais qu'est-ce qu'elle fout dans mes pensées? 
C'est déjà pris, déjà complet. 
Qu'est-ce qu'elle faut là 
Et pourquoi ça me fait ça? 

Tout petit, c'est tout petit, un homme dans la nuit, 
Qui se met les points sur les ""i"", là sous la pluie. 
Je regarde les choses en face, 
Celles qui laissent des traces, 
Et je me dis 
Qu'y'a plus beaucoup de place dans ma vie. 
J'arrive un peu bizarre 
Sur les grands boulevards. 
Je suis tout seul, tout seul à Paris sous la pluie. 

Et tout au fond de moi, 
Je sais bien que je le serai pas. 
Je me connais bien, je suis pas comme ça, 
Mais c'était bien
D'y penser et d'en rester là. 

Bluesy, je suis bluesy comme une fin de nuit, 
Quand on retourne à sa vie, là sous la pluie. 
Y'a des histoires qui passent 
Sans laisser de traces 
Mais qui sait, est-ce que c'est tant mieux ou tant pis. 
J'arrive enfin chez moi 
Et je laisse tout ça. 
Là dehors, dehors à Paris sous la pluie

Je n´aurais regardé que toi

Y avait ce soleil-là
Qui donnait à ce moment-là
Je ne sais, je ne sais quoi

Ce soleil-là
J´aimais ce soleil-là
Qui donnait à ce moment-là
Ce je ne sais quoi
Qui arrêtait le temps
Et tout n´était que
Ce soleil-là
Jour après jour
Ce soleil-là
J´aurais toujours
Ce soleil-là
Tant que tu seras là
Tu seras là",Ce Soleil La
Michel Fugain,"Je vous dois depuis l'école toutes mes folies
Des journées entières à rêver de vos paradis
Cette envie que j'ai de mourir dans vos bras
Pourquoi pas ?
Deux ou trois chagrins qui traînent
Mais j'avoue que j'y pense à peine
Allons-y

Dansez, dansez mes belles
Tant que la terre tournera
Allez-y, dansez mes demoiselles
Un jour Dieu vous le rendra

Je vous dois des nuits d'ivresse à chanter sous la pluie
Des matins pleins de tendresse et quelques insomnies
Ce besoin de vous qui ne me lâche pas
Pourquoi pas ?
Et j'aurai le regret sans doute
De ne pas vous avoir eues toutes
Allons-y

Dansez, dansez mes belles
Tant que la terre tournera
Allez-y, dansez mes demoiselles
Un jour Dieu vous le rendra

(Dansez, dansez, dansez)
Un jour Dieu vous le rendra
(Dansez, dansez, dansez)
Dansez, ne pensez qu'à ça
(Dansez, dansez, dansez)
Dansez la vie n'attend que ça

Dansez, dansez mes belles
Tant que la terre tournera
Allez-y, dansez mes demoiselles
Un jour Dieu vous le rendra",Chanson Pour Les Demoiselles [Live]
Michel Fugain,"A quoi ça sert l'amour
Si c'est un aller sans retour
Y 'a plus que du vide à la place
Mais que veux-tu que j'en fasse?

A quoi ça sert la vie
Quand on meurt petit à petit
S'il ne reste plus que l'absence
A qui veux-tu que je pense?

Je jure si tu reviens
Je saurai être heureux d'un sourire
Je jure que j'apprendrai à écrire
Tous les mots pour le dire

Chaque jour de plus est un jour de trop
Je plie déjà sous le fardeau
Chaque jour de plus est un jour de trop
Est-ce que tu reviendras bientôt?

Et moi je sers à quoi
Si je n'suis plus la moitié de toi
Si ta vie n'est plus dans le mienne
Comment veux-tu que je tienne?

Je jure si tu reviens
J'apprendrai à étre différent
Je jure que je saurai simplement
Laisser le temps au temps

Chaque jour de plus est un jour de trop
Je plie déjà sous le fardeau
Chaque jour de plus est un jour de trop
Est-ce que tu reviendras bientôt?

Il ne reste plus que l'absence
A qui veux-tu que je pense?

Michel Fugain,"Fais comme l'oiseau
Ya vit d'air pur et d'eau fraiche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de peche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien de l'emp?
Che l'oiseau
D'aller plus haut

Mais je suis seul dans l'univers
J'ai peur du ciel et de l'hiver
J'ai peur des fous et de la guerre
J'ai peur du temps qui passe, dis
Comment peut-on vivre aujourd'hui
Dans la fureur et dans le bruit
Je ne sais pas,
Je ne sais plus, je suis perdu

Et l'amour don't on m'a parlé
Cet amour que l'on m'a chanté
Ce sauveur de l'humanit?
Je n'en vois pas la trace, dis
Comment peut-on vivre sans lui
Sous quelle étoile, dans quel pays
Je n'y crois pas, je n'y crois plu
S, je suis perdu

Mais j'en ai marre d'etre roulé
Par des marchands de liberté
Et d'écouter se lamenter
Ma gueule dans la glace, dis
Est-ce que je dois montrer les dents
Est-ce que je dois baisser les bras
Je ne sais pas, je ne sais plus, je suis perdu",Fais Comme l'Oiseau [Live]
Michel Fugain,"Tiens tout a changé ce matin

C'est comme un grand coup de soleil

Merde que ma ville est belle
Sans ces putains de camions
Plus de gaz-oil mais du gazon
Jusque sur le goudron
Merde que ma ville est belle
Avec ces gosses qui jouent
Qui rigolent et qui cassent tout
Qui n'ont plus peur du loup!
Et l'eau c'est vraiment de l'eau
Que l'on peut boire au creux des ruisseaux

Venez danser dans la rue
Ce n'est plus défendu
C'est la fête, la fête
En vérité je vous le dis
C'est le paradis
C'est la fête, la fête

C'est comme un grand coup de soleil

Michel Fugain,"L'amour est une forteresse
Dont les murs sont faits de promesses
C'est là que dorment les amants
Cachés de tout, cachés du temps

Et quand leurs lèvres se rejoignent
C'est tout l'univers qui s'éloigne
Autour le silence est parfait
Comme un instant d'éternité

Tourne le, tourne le, tourne le temps
Tout autour des amants

L'amour est une forteresse
Dont les murs sont faits de tendresse
Aussi fins qu'un papier de soie
Mais qui ne se déchirent pas

La peau et la peau qui se touchent
Les mots qui naissent sur la bouche
Disent tout bas comme un secret
Qu'on peut tout prendre et tout donner

Tourne le, tourne le, tourne le temps
Tout autour des amants

L'amour est une forteresse
Qu'il faut réinventer sans cesse
Pour qui oublie de la rêver
Elle disparaît à tout jamais

Si devant vous des amants passent
Quoi qu'ils se disent ou quoi qu'ils fassent
Ne vous posez pas de question
L'amour a toujours ses raisons

Tourne le, tourne le, tourne le temps
Tout autour des amants

Tourne le, tourne le, tourne le temps
Tout autour des amants",Forteresse
Michel Fugain,"On est la pierre, on est le sable, 
On est de glace et de soleil, 
Un peu de sang, de sueur et de larmes
Et aussi la violence qui sommeille
On sait pourtant qu'il faut tenir
A chaque aurore, chaque matin, 
Rêvant du bien et capable du pire
On suit comme on peut sa vie, son chemin

Je nous aime et souvent je me demande
Pourquoi c'est de l'amour et pas de la haine
Je sais seulement que je nous aime, 
Sans bien comprendre, sans réfléchir
Je nous aime, j'aime le dire

On se rassemble et on se donne
Des coups de cur, des coups de poing
Et comme on se ressemble, on se pardonne
On fait la paix au moins jusqu'à demain, 
Rêvant du bien et capables du pire, 
On suit comme on peut sa vie, son chemin

Je nous aime et souvent je me demande
Pourquoi c'est de l'amour et pas de la haine
Je sais seulement que je nous aime, 
Sans bien comprendre, sans réfléchir
Je nous aime, j'aime le dire

Le soir, lorsque la nuit se lève, 
On pose les armes en silence
On laisse aller son cur qui se soulève
Et on retrouve un peu de son enfance
Et c'est pour ça que je nous aime",Je Nous Aime [Live]
Michel Fugain,"Demandez la liberté

Avec des signes bizarres et tellement peu d'effort, Alleluia... 
Lire entre les lignes 
Du théorème de Pythagore 

Alors... 
Alleluia... 

La casa corazon nunca esta perdida 
Y si quieres la vida hay que matar la muerte 
Nos oublis volontaires, l'avenir du passé sont nos ennemis 
Si quieres el ayer hay que mirar en mi 

Tes mains peignent un coquelicot 
Si solide par grand vent, Alleluia... 
Prends la mer à son tempo et navigue vers l'avant, Alleluia... 
Tout droit sur cet horizon 
De hasards et d'illusions 

Alors... 
Alleluia... 

La casa corazon nunca esta perdida 
Y si quieres la vida hay que matar la muerte 
Nos oublis volontaires, l'avenir du passé sont nos ennemis 
Si quieres el ayer hay que mirar en mi 

Les espions de l'âme sont aveugles. Ça rend fou 
S'ils n'ont même plus le temps de se pencher sur toi 
C'est le vent du hasard qui efface leurs pas 

Virgile dans l'Énéide racontait en riant, Alleluia, Alleluia... 
L'amour indélébile d'un prince ensorcelant, Alleluia... 
Le temps remonte le Nil, 
Le temps est un diamant

Michel Fugain,"On était une poignée 
De jeunes rhinocéros
Aux belles cornes soignées.
On lorgnait d'un œil féroce
Des moutons, des crânes creux,
Résignés, bêlants, dociles
De vrais imbéciles heureux,
De vrais imbéciles.

Du matin jusqu'au matin
Et de la cruche à la cruche,
Sous les lampadaires éteints
On éclatait des baudruches,
Des soumis, des liquoreux,
Des placeurs de mots faciles,
Des vrais imbéciles heureux,
Des vrais imbéciles.

On se comptait sur le poing,
On pleurait de pas grand-chose,
On riait de tout et rien
En ces temps dont je vous cause,
Et moins on était nombreux
Plus on était invincibles
Face aux imbéciles heureux,
Face aux imbéciles.

Certains de nous ont vieilli,
Certains se sont effacés,
Quelques Judas ont trahi
D'autres se sont fait passer
Des menottes d'amoureux
Pour un battement de cil
Comme des imbéciles heureux,
Comme des imbéciles.

Quelques paléontologues,
Un jour, sortiront de terre
Des rires d'ancienne vogue
Aux pieds de nos réverbères.
Je les entends dire entre eux,
En découvrant nos fossiles :
Tiens ! Des imbéciles heureux,
De beaux imbéciles.
Tiens ! Des imbéciles heureux,
De beaux imbéciles.",Les Imbéciles Heureux
Michel Fugain,"Toutes ces images qu'on nous montre
Ces horreurs qu'on nous raconte
Ce grand robinet à douleur
Pour nous plomber le coeur

Du poison pour toute la semaine
Sans faire aucun mal à personne
Non coupable mais tout comme

Qu'on en oublie
Que le monde est si beau
Et que l'amour est un sacré cadeau
La vie, la vie, quel joli mot la vie (bis)

C'est l'histoire de la bouteille
A moitié vide à moitié pleine
Tout n'est pas rose évidemment
Ni tout noir pour autant
Sans mettre des oeillères
On peut prendre un peu l'air
Avoir envie de faire une pause
Parler des belles choses

De dire tout haut
Que le monde est si beau
Et que l'amour est un sacré cadeau
La vie, la vie, quel joli mot la vie (ter)

Quitte à paraître politiquement incorrect
Naïf, imbécile, je persiste et signe

Michel Griffin,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Well this scene is hot
Even if you’re not
We’ll show you the way

You’ve got too many thrills left unclaimed
Too many women you wanna forget
Worries you wanna loose
Check your troubles behind
And have yourself a good time
Try a little toke
Drink a little booze

I can feel you’re down and disgusted
I can see all the broken-hearted
If you’ve been busted and dusted
I’ve got some good news for you
Let your mind get away

That my man’s name is Lou
Gonna blow for you

You’ve picked up the right place
You chose the right space
Ain’t no doubt about it
Best spot for action
Sure satisfaction
Just hang on to your seat

If your woman has treated you wrong
If you’ve heard too much of that same old song
Time to look for some new kind of action
Time for you to get loose
Check your troubles behind
And have yourself a good time
Take a little cruise
Have a little juice

Michel Jonasz,"He came on like a hurricane
And suddenly drove me insane
Swept me off my feet into the sky
I couldn’t resist it, we got so high
But here today and gone tomorrow
That’s the story of my sorrow

From city street to country lane
Will I ever see you again
Walking endlessly mile after mile
Searchin’ ev’rywhere until I die
But here today and gone tomorrow
That’s the story of my sorrow

My friends don’t understand
Why I still care for you
After all the pain and tears
That you have put me through
They say I’ve lost control
But my love was so strong
I won’t ever give up on us
No matter what went wrong

He came on like a hurricane
And suddenly drove me insane
Swept me off my feet into the sky
I couldn’t resist it, we got so high
But here today and gone tomorrow

I’m gonna loose my mind

I saw her last night
Cruising down the avenue
I saw her last night
Cruising down the avenue
Just can’t recall her name
Just haven’t got a clue

I thought her name was Sally
Then I thought her name was Sue
It could have been Mary or maybe Linda Lu
It could have been Helen that’s right Helen as sweet as morning dew

on part battu
qu’il n’y a pas d’autre alternative pas d’autre issue

le temps passé n’est pas passé inaperçu

On s’est aimé coeurs enlacés dessous dessus
comment ces doutes ont commencé nul ne l’a su
on s’est regardé autrement et on a eu peur
que l’ombre grandisse
que l’coeur se ferme
et que la peau puisse perdre un jour de sa douceur
mais tout ça n’vaut rien
tout ça n’est plus

Bonsoir vous voulez quoi
Chapeau melon claquettes et tout ça
Je veux bien même essayer
Mais je promets rien, tiens déjà l'amour je l'ai raté
Vous aussi vous avez
Dans le coeur un morceau cassé
Et du style je soupir,
Qu'est-ce-que vous allez dire
Le papier peint me sort par les yeux
Les voisins me bassinent un peu
Je passe ma vie à faire le douze
Je sais ce qui te faut

Michel Jonasz,"Je veux aller où l'air est plus doux
Où la colombe vole en-dessous
Où le printemps entre un jour comme un fou
Vous saisit au revers
Au détour d'un chemin vert
Et vous dit 
Ca va pas comme ça
Changez tout changez tout
Votre monde ne tient pas debout
Changez tout
Changez tout
Changez tout

Je veux aller dans l'après-midi
D'un jour où rien n'est interdit
Où le bonheur sans faire de comédie
Vous salue sans manières
Et vous parle à cœur ouvert
Et vous dit
Qu'est-ce que t'as bien fait
De changer tout changer tout
Pour une vie qui vaille le coup
Changez tout
Changez tout

Michel Jonasz,"Elle avait toujours
Dans son porte-monnaie
L'île au trésor
Et des pièces de un franc usées
Un pinceau de poil de martre
Pour mettre des rideaux bleus
Aux fenêtres de ses yeux
Aux fenêtres de ses yeux

Un livre à la main sur le balcon
Elle s'endormait dans un vieux fauteuil de Manille
Je cherchais des prénoms Mathieu, Cécile
En regardant courir vers dix heures
Dans l'école des filles et des garçons

Dites-moi 
Dites-moi même qu'elle est partie pour un autre que moi
Mais pas à cause de moi
Dites-moi ça
Dites-moi ça

Dites-moi même qu'elle est partie pour un autre que moi

Dans mon cœur vaudou
Il y a quatre épingles
Qu'elle a pris soin d'abandonner pour que je pleure
J'ai cloué ma porte qu'est-ce-qui m'a pris
J'ai brisé le miroir où elle faisait ses tresses
Mis du papier journal sous les fenêtres
J'entendais de l'école trop de cris
Il n'est rien né de notre lit

Dites-moi 
Dites-moi même qu'elle est partie pour un autre que moi

Michel Jonasz,"J'veux pas que tu t'en ailles 
Pourquoi?
Parce-que j'ai attendu beaucoup

Et que je t'ai cherchée partout
A en boire toute l'eau des rivières, pour voir le fond
Et pour en soulever les pierres
A couper les arbres des bois, pour voir plus loin
Entre New-York et Versailles
J'veux pas que tu t'en ailles 
Je voulais des vagues et des S,
Avec une à moi ma déesse
Et je roulais tout en zigzag et n'importe où
Avec mes confettis mes blagues
Jetés aux pieds des gens dans les soirées mondaines
Avec leur tête à funérailles
J'veux pas que tu t'en ailles,
J'veux pas que tu t'en ailles

On voulait faire des galipettes
Des ploufs dans l'eau des Antilles
Au sombrero pour moi, pour toi mantille
Manger des papayes à Papette, à Cuaico, aux Galapagos
Les goyaves de Guayagui à toutes les sauces
Plonger dans les mers de corail
J'veux pas que tu t'en ailles
J'veux pas que tu t'en ailles

Quand j'irai miauler mes refrains
En pensant tout ça c'est pour rien
Ma voix qui s'en va dans les fils et dans les airs
Sûr qu'elle va retomber par terre
Et que mes couplets de misère seront pour toi
Du graffiti sur du vitrail
J'veux pas que tu t'en ailles

Michel Jonasz,"Je mettrai mon cœur dans du papier d'argent
Mon numéro d'appel aux abonnés absents.
Mes chansons d'amour resteront là dans mon piano
J'aurai jeté la clé du piano dans l'eau
J'irai voir les rois de la brocante
""Vendez mon cœur trois francs cinquante""
Tu savais si bien l'écouter
Que ma vie s'est arrêtée
Quand tu m'as quitté

Je voulais te dire que je t'attends
Et tant pis si je perds mon temps.
Je t'attends, je t'attends tout le temps
Sans me décourager pourtant
Comme quelqu'un qui n'a plus personne
S'endort près de son téléphone
Et sourit quand on le réveille
Mais ce n'était que le soleil

L'autre jour, j'ai vu quelqu'un qui te ressemble
Et la rue était comme une photo qui tremble.
Si c'est toi qui passe le jour où je me promène
Si c'est vraiment toi, je vois déjà la scène
Moi je te regarde
Et tu me regardes.

Je voulais te dire que je t'attends
Et tant pis si je perds mon temps.
Je t'attends, je t'attends tout le temps
Ce soir, demain, n'importe quand
Comme quelqu'un qui n'a plus personne
S'endort près de son téléphone
Et qui te cherche à son réveil
Tout seul au soleil, j'attends
Je voulais te dire que je t'attends

Michel Jonasz,"On allait au bord de la mer
Avec mon père, ma sœur, ma mère
On regardait les autres gens
Comme ils dépensaient leur argent
Nous il fallait faire attention
Quand on avait payé le prix d'une location
Il ne nous restait pas grand-chose

Alors on regardait les bateaux
On suçait des glaces à l'eau
Les palaces, les restaurants
On ne faisait que passer d'vant
Et on regardait les bateaux
Le matin on se réveillait tôt
Sur la plage pendant des heures
On prenait de belles couleurs

On allait au bord de la mer
Avec mon père, ma sœur, ma mère
Et quand les vagues étaient tranquilles
On passait la journée aux îles
Sauf quand on pouvait déjà plus

Alors on regardait les bateaux
On suçait des glaces à l'eau
On avait le cœur un peu gros
Mais c'était quand même beau

On regardait les bateaux

silencieux reflet d'une danseuse étoile
les pensées s'arrêtent heure limpide
et le bonheur tranquille qui s'installe

Seul mouvement visible sur les arbres tout autour
de l'étendue qui repose immobile
quelques feuilles sensibles à la tombée du jour
et s'installe le bonheur tranquille

D'abord incrédule elle voit l'âme candide
l'éternel instant qui se dévoile
le temps qui s'arrête heure limpide

et puis dehors une pluie fine

Toutes ces années à t'attendre
c'était comme le feu sous la cendre
c'était comme une ville endormie

Des nuits longues des nuits blanches
des nuits tristes en avalanche
et le manque d'amour qui grandit

ne parlons plus de l'absence reprends ta place
non n'aie pas peur y'a personne

Michel Jonasz,"Le cœur d'un enfant c'est grand
des vaisseaux spatiaux s'y baladent
et si leurs Mamans tombent malades
elles guérissent en regardant dedans

On y voit des goélands
on y boit des rivières d'orangeade
en écoutant les galopades
d'un cheval pur-sang

Le cœur d'un enfant c'est grand
l'amour s'y déverse en cascade
l'ours blanc fait des glissades
sur la seule neige du monde qui dure vraiment

Le cœur d'un enfant c'est grand
le temps s'y transforme en espace
et l'espace en un instant
peut dev'nir le temps qui passe

On croise un éléphant blanc
deux indiens en embuscade
un troupeau d'élans qui gambadent
un cheval pur-sang

Le cœur d'un enfant c'est grand
on y voit la lune qui s'déplace
on y voit le bleu firmament
dans l'cœur d'un enfant y'a d'la place

Michel Jonasz,"On laissait des traces derrière nous comme des baisers
des mots d'amour suspendus
les gosses des campagnes aimaient bien ramasser
toutes nos caresses perdues

Facile de savoir par où on était passé
les marques étaient encore fraîches
pour retrouver la source où tout a commencé
nous pouvions suivre les flèches

celles qui sur les écorces dans un cœur transpercé
indiquant le ch'min parcouru
nous montraient du doigt les ruelles traversées
les soupirs de bonheur encore accrochés
aux branches des saules par le vent battues

On laissait des traces derrière nous sans y penser
des mots d'amour suspendus
les oiseaux rapides aimaient bien rattraper
toutes nos caresses perdues

facile de comprendre comment ça c'était passé
car lorsque les larmes sèchent
il reste toujours une tache là où elles sont tombées
ce sont elles qui nous empêchent

d'oublier les écorces et leurs cœurs transpercés
d'oublier nos âmes décousues
d'où s'échappaient souvent glissant dans les fossés
ces soupirs d'un bonheur difficile à garder
qui grandissait de plus en plus

facile de comprendre comment ça s'était passé
comment c'était au tout début

les traces que l'on laisse derrière nous comme des baisers

Michel Jonasz,"On s'était sur les récifs jetés
comme deux zéros pointés
devant le mur crépi
des décrépitudes

Accrochés à la nacelle des jours
elle nous trouvait trop lourds
et descendait bas
vers l'ombre des habitudes

Nous passions entre les chênes
avec celle qui nous enchaîne
l'un à l'autre
comme la mer à l'écume
mais nous brûlions nos dernières flammes
cachions nos premières larmes
dans une étrange alliance
de douceur d'amertume

De tokay vin sucré
de nuages cendrés
par les bouffées d'afghane
au cabaret tzigane

Le temps nous avait prév'nus
son vol est suspendu

qui souffrent et qui s'aiment

Ça pour s'aimer on s'aimait
deux gosses à tout jamais
que l'amour soit en vous comme il est
dans ces deux-là disait Dieu lui-même

déchirant les états d'âme

Michel Jonasz,"Ils sont sur les éponges mouillées du temps qui passe
ces baisers qu'on voulait donner et qui s'effacent
s'envolent au gré des courants d'air et des zéphyrs
et n'ont duré que l'instant d'un demi-soupir

Une ombre un soir l'ai-je oublié ou est-ce un rêve
un jeu d'enfant dans l'adolescence qui s'achève
une vision du passé autour de moi voltige
comme les tulles d'une fenêtre ouverte sur le vertige

et c'est une femme qui marche et je n'l'ai pas suivi
le sable ne garde aucune trace des amants désunis
sur des plages encombrées par les jours qui s'allongent

Ils sont sur les éponges mouillées du temps qui passe
ces baisers qu'on voulait donner et qui s'effacent
dérivent au gré des courants marins nord-nord-est

J'avais tout le courage du monde au soleil couchant
quand on s'en va des villes quand on revient des champs
on s'est regardé on s'est vu et on s'est rien dit
et ces mots jamais prononcés tombent dans l'oubli

Avec ces étreintes éternelles jamais partagées
elles sont enfouies sous le sable des sabliers
sur des plages encombrées par les jours qui s'allongent

jusque sous les pins des Landes
où le vent m'a caressé
j'ai cherché

Le long de l'Hérault tranquille
dans les rues grises des grandes villes
sous la voûte céleste étoilée
j'ai cherché

Aux merveilleuses fins d'automne
quand la couleur des feuilles donne
aux arbres leur merveilleuse clarté
j'ai cherché

Terre humide sous mes épaules
à l'ombre des larmes d'un saule
sur l'herbe tendre allongé
j'ai cherché

Les jours passés me reviennent
parfum d'une forêt vosgienne
rivière où j'allais pêcher
j'ai cherché

C'est ma soeur âme ma frangine
la neige ô la neige divine
chantait sous mes pas d'écolier
j'ai cherché

Hier enfant dans ma chambre
à l'aurore aux couleurs d'ambre
pressentant le grand mystère
j'ai cherché

Plus tard aux premières conquêtes
à l'heure des premiers baisers
si troublante qu'il ne m'en reste
rien d'autre que le besoin d'aimer
quand tout le reste s'arrête
j'ai cherché

Où est la source 
c'est une étoile sous la mer
c'est la Grande Ourse
un voilier blanc sous l'azur
qui poursuit sa course
où est l'eau pure 
où trouver l'air
qui fera de l'homme obscur
un homme lumière
de nos âmes divisées
une âme entière 
où est l'eau qui désaltère 

Dans la garrigue en Provence
en Inde sous le ciel immense
au soleil de février
j'ai cherché

La nuit langoureuse lascive
env'loppant toute âme qui vive
d'une éternelle infinité
j'ai cherché

La nuit lumière indicible
où l'on perçoit l'invisible
où se dévoile enfin
l'éternité

Dans les rêves où tout arrive
où l'on peut voir l'autre rive
et s'envoler de l'autre côté
j'ai cherché

Terre humide après l'averse
par les chemins de traverse
au cœur des vastes Cévennes
en été

Respirant aux heures propices
le souffle des muses inspiratrices
dans mes chansons sur la scène
j'ai cherché

Le berceau originel
le foyer universel
partout sur la Terre
j'ai cherché

Et c'est ma dernière conquête
c'est mon ultime volonté
dans mon corps et dans ma tête
rien d'autre
que le besoin d'aimer
dans l'infini bonheur d'être
j'ai cherché

Où est la source 
c'est une étoile sous la mer
c'est la Grande Ourse
un voilier blanc sous l'azur
qui poursuit sa course
où est l'eau pure 
où trouver l'air
qui fera de l'homme obscur
un homme lumière
de nos âmes divisées
une âme entière 
où est l'eau qui désaltère 

C'est elle en moi ce feu qui brûle
c'est elle ce besoin d'aimer
elle en moi qui coule et chaque cellule
contient l'infini liberté
c'est elle en moi ce feu qui brûle
c'est elle ce besoin d'aimer
c'est elle en moi ce feu qui brûle
c'est elle ce besoin d'aimer",Où Est La Source
Michel Jonasz,"J'sais pas pourquoi
ce piano-là
ne joue qu'en mineur
ce meuble noir
a dû en voir
de toutes les couleurs
en espérant faire fortune pour lui
j'ai dépensé toutes mes tunes
c'était une erreur
moi j'avais l'âme d'un fantaisiste
mais pas lui
non pas lui
il a des cordes trop sensibles à nos douleurs
pourrait passer sa vie
à en dresser la liste
vous comprenez pourquoi
ce blues très lent
ce blues très triste
vient du piano
pas du pianiste
c'est moi l'instrument
c'est lui l'artiste
pauvre piano
pauvre pianiste

Mais l'pire de tout
ça ça m'rend fou
c'est sa pudeur
une tour d'ivoire
dans sa mémoire
cache sa douleur
d'où lui vient cette amertume
qui le sait la cause de son infortune
est-ce une peine de cœur
aucun signe visible aucune piste
qui permettrait qui permettrait
de débusquer l'origine de tous ses malheurs
et l'aider à sortir d'une mélancolie qui persiste
qu'on puisse faire autre chose
que ce blues très lent
ce blues très triste
qui vient du piano
pas du pianiste
c'est moi l'instrument
lui le soliste
pauvre piano
pauvre pianiste

Je suis en toi
prête-moi ta voix
pauvre chanteur
tu veux savoir
pourquoi le soir
je n'joue qu'en mineur
y'a longtemps un soir de brume
furent écrits ces fameux rêves d'amour nocturnes
par mon possesseur
moi j'avais l'âme d'un fantaisiste
mais pas lui
non pas lui
voilà pourquoi je suis sensible à vos douleurs

Je n'pouvais pas savoir qu'il gardait
en lui l'âme de Liszt
je comprends maint'nant

Michel Jonasz,"L'amour comme un cordon ombilical
qui relierait la Terre aux étoiles

adieu
ô mon amour j'ai eu si mal
quand la mort a déployé sa voile
le soleil radieux
le souffle fou des tempêtes
invincible le temps qui passe
que rien n'arrête
n'ont pu sécher mes larmes
ni taire ma douleur secrète

Comme je t'aimais ma princesse
mon étoile
comme j'aimais tes yeux d'opale
et de bleu

Moi Shah Jahan empereur Moghol
moi qui fus le roi des rois
je pourrais vivre sans richesses d'une obole
mais comment vivre sans toi 

L'amour
dès l'aube et ses premières lueurs pâles
aux premières couleurs matinales
je m'adresse à Dieu
mon Dieu
tu m'as pris mon souffle vital
tu m'as pris ma princesse mon étoile
mon soleil radieux
garde-la loin des tempêtes
remplis mon cœur et mon corps
mon âme inquiète
toi seul peux sécher mes larmes
effacer ma douleur secrète

Comme je t'aimais ma princesse
mon étoile
comme j'aimais tes yeux d'opale

Regarde il est là
c'est mon ultime cadeau nuptial
un lien entre toi et moi
entre nos âmes un canal
regarde c'est pour toi

On jouait le dimanche
les pierres du terrain vague dev'naient
du sable d'or
et l'on voyait l'écume
on s'inventait l'orage
au loin un sémaphore

Regarde comme il penche
le voilier sur la vague
regarde il rentre au port
quand deux âmes ne sont qu'une
elles font le même voyage
et c'est l'île au trésor

Il pleut

Tu m'écris des poèmes
murmura-t-elle un soir
c'est bien mais pas assez
regarde-moi dans les yeux
pour savoir si on s'aime
vraiment
faut s'embrasser

Et j'ai posé mes lèvres
sur sa bouche enfantine
mon coeur battait si fort
que c'était comme un feu
brûlant dans ma poitrine
c'était l'île aux trésor

On s'aim'ra tous les deux
jusqu'à la fin du monde
et même après la mort
on ira s'embrasser
cachés aux yeux du monde
derrière un météore

Un jour elle est partie
pour une ville autre part
un jour elle m'a laissé
adieu l'écume adieu
le voilier sur la vague
adieu sable doré

Et j'ai marché longtemps
dans les rues au hasard
longtemps j'l'ai cherchée
et j'ai pleuré souvent
au bord du terrain vague
et puis j'ai oublié

une voix en nous disait yes futur
c'était une voix magnifique

et on a chanté
viv'ment l'av'nir

remplacé à jamais
par le seul qui peut guérir

Le lendemain matin
dans la rue les gens c'était pas banal
se sont r'gardés avec le sourire
qu'est-ce que c'est dites
ça semblait descendre des étoiles
en tout cas c'était magnifique

Ils se sont enlacés et leurs mains d'enfant battaient la mesure
ils inventaient leur propre musique
le monde entier dansait yes futur
ce fut un moment magique

à toucher juste du bout des doigts l'ciel étoilé
là
sans s'mettre sur la pointe des pieds

L'amour ça devient sérieux

on se sent prêt à partir

Baby là
on pourrait s'jeter d'une falaise les yeux fermés
oui là
on est sûr de s'envoler
là ça devient sérieux tu sais

à la première crise de rire
on se découvre audacieux
on a l'coeur prêt à partir
et surtout cette chaleur partout

Baby là
on pourrait marcher sous les mers et traverser
là

on cherche le juste milieu

Michel Jonasz,"Souviens-toi de ces amoureuses qu'on regardait glisser le long des palissades
entre nous et l'école des filles
sur ces apprenties langoureuses nous jetions sans qu'elles sachent presque à la dérobade
des p'tits coups d'oeil qui déshabillent

Et l'on profitait d'un espace entre deux planches 
pour glisser des billets doux
ils étaient anonymes nous avions carte blanche
on leur donnait rendez-vous

Des rendez-vous impossibles car nous n'aurions jamais osé le geste tendre
dont nous rêvions tous les jours
alors on écrivait je t'aime et l'on signait celui qui n'en peut plus d'attendre
celui qui se meurt d'amour

Nous les croisions par hasard samedi dimanche
dans les jardins dans les rues
mais nous préférions les palissades et les planches
et le goût du fruit défendu

Souviens-toi de ces  amoureuses qu'on regardait glisser le long des palissades

la route qu'on ne peut plus prendre
c'est la pluie sur les carreaux

souviens-toi des soirées cubaines
aux accents du Boléro

Et je m'en vais l'âme en peine
les jours se suivent et s'enchaînent
comme les accords d'un piano

Vivre sans toi c'est attendre
écouter le ciel se répandre
en pluie fine sur les carreaux

Elles me manquent nos nuits d'étoiles
nos voyages sans escales
il me manque le brasero

Qui brûle quand on est ensemble
quand nos deux corazons s'assemblent
aux accents du Boléro

Je meurs j'ai envie d'entendre
encore tes mots les plus tendres
qui mettaient mon coeur en lambeaux

Encore le feu qui s'allume
encore nos corps qui se consument

par une fenêtre éclairée
sur un mur de pierre l'ombre fragile

Ils vivaient sans doute leur première idylle
d'une attente la récompense

ils vivaient la fin de l'enfance

et ils attendent qu’une mémoire ancienne
leur accorde une dernière chance
où vont les rêves où vont les rêves
où vont les rêves où vont les rêves

Tous ces désirs inassouvis qui s’amoncellent
on voulait s’endormir à l’ombre d’une immortelle
se glisser sous un arc en ciel
comme un oiseau sous un arc en ciel
où vont les rêves où vont les rêves
où vont les rêves où vont les rêves

Où vont les rêves quand on les oublie
où sont nos premières blessures
on les retrouve quelquefois la nuit
dans nos cœurs leur signature

Et c’est un feu lorsqu’ils nous reviennent
c’est une douleur qui nous lance
elles nous rappellent ces mémoires anciennes
qu’il nous reste une dernière chance
où vont les rêves où vont les rêves
où vont les rêves où vont les rêves

Tous ces désirs inassouvis qui s’amoncellent
on voulait s’endormir à l’ombre d’une immortelle

oh je t’aime ça y est j’te l’ai dit
entre mon âme et mes paroles

et j’dédicace à celle que j’aime
ces chansons qui n’viennent
pas d’n’importe où
mais du fond de mon vrai moi-méme
oh je t’aime j’te l’ai dit
j’vais jusqu’au bout

et je pose comme un diadème
sur son front des phrases
mises bout à bout
chaque lettre est une perle rare
je les accroche autour de ton cou

Traversant les rivières qui les arrêtaient
franchissant l’infranchissable
tous ces passages à niveau fermés
surgissant au grand jour enfin de mon moi véritable
les voici ces mots vérité

Même si ce n’est qu’une petite parcelle d’un amour infini
un p’tit morceau invisible
deux simples syllabes et nous sommes
oh je t’aime ça y est j’te l’ai dit
de toute éternité l’indivisible

Et j’dédicace à celle que j’aime
ces chansons qui n’viennent
pas d’n’importe où
mais du fond de mon vrai moi-même
oh je t’aime j’te l’ai dit
j’vais jusqu’au bout

Et je pose comme un diadème
sur son front des phrases
mises bout à bout
chaque lettre est une pierre précieuse
je les accroche autour de ton cou

Et j’dédicace à celle que j’aime
ces chansons qui m’viennent
tout à coup",Je T'aime

Grimper tout en haut jusqu’au sommet d’ la gloire
Et chanter, le duo enchanté, le duo qui cartonne

Hé Black, les images me r’viennent en vrac 
Le jour où on a pris une claque à la MJC

Un copain le directeur et sa fiancée

En chantant Hoochie Coochie Man bien balancé

Michel Legrand,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name?
I know the way I feel for you it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck then I suppose
The music never ends
I know, the way I feel for you
It's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever

Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck then I suppose

Michel Legrand,"If it takes forever I will wait for you
For a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms

Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
Every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forevermore I'll wait for you

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my waiting arms

If it takes forever I will wait for you
For a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you
And forevermore sharing your love","I Will Wait For You [Love Theme From ""Parapluies De Cherbourg""]"
Michel Legrand,"The night is getting on
The band is getting slow
The crowd is almost gone
But here we are still dancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

Our feet can barely move
My legs are yelling ""Whoa""
But we're in such a groove
And love is still advancing

Nothing to do, but waltz

You can't suggest that we could go on jitterbugging
No bugging

We've nothing left for moves more strenuous than hugging
Just hugging

But we don't need much room to gently cut-a-rug in, we two

We're dead on our feet
And the sauce is repeatin'
But what can you do?

I tried another juice
And get from head to toe
My body's feeling loose
And warm and kind of supple

Nothing to do, but waltz

My man would slip away
My arms just won't let go
I think I'd like to stay,
Till we're the only couple

Nothing to do, but waltz

You never know how far this sort of thing can get you
One never knows, one never, never knows

We're not as tired as we would like to think, I bet you
You stay up half the night with me, if I would let you
Yes

So come, let the waltz play again",The Jitterbug Waltz
Michel Legrand,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore",Nuages
Michel Legrand,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Michel Legrand,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?
",Moulin Rouge
Michel Legrand,"I make a date for gown, 
you can bet your life it rains. 
Tried to give a party 
But the guy upstairs complains. 
Guess I'll go through life 
catching colds and missing trains. 
Everything happens to me. 

I never miss a thing 
I've had the measles and the mumps. 
And everytime I play an ace 
My partner always trumps. 
Guess I'm just a fool 
who never looks before he jumps. 
everything happens to me. 

At first I thought that you would end this jinx for me. 
And love would turn the trick to end dispair. 
Now I just cant fool this head that thinks for me. 
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air. 
Well I've telegraphed and phoned. 
Sent an air mail special too. 
Your answer was goodby. 
There was even postage due. 
fell in love just once, 
And it had to be with you. 
Everything happens to me.","Everything That Happens to You, Happens to Me"
Michel Legrand,"If I could save time in a bottle 
The first thing that I'd like to do 
Is to save every day 
'Til eternity passes away 
Just to spend them with you. 

If I could make days last forever 
If words could make wishes come true 
I'd save every day like a treasure and then, 
Again, I would spend them with you. 

But there never seems to be enough time 
To do the things you want to do 
Once you find them 
I've looked around enough to know 
That you're the one I want to go 
Through time with. 

If I had a box just for wishes 
And dreams that had never come true 
The box would be empty 
Except for the memory 
Of how they were answered by you 

But there never seems to be enough time 
To do the things you want to do 
Once you find them 
I've looked around enough to know 
That you're the one I want to go 
Through time with",Time in a Bottle
Michel Legrand,"I've played the game of love before
Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought
The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Michel Legrand,"Little boy lost in search of little boy found
You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it? 
Little boy blue, don't let your little sheep roam
It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home? 
",Pieces of Dreams
Michel Legrand,"I may get around
I may laugh a lot
Now you'd think that I'd be happy with the life I got
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Ain't nobody really knows the inner side of me

I may seem secure
I could have it made
You might think you see a lucky man who made the grade
Nobody knows what dreams I see
Ain't nobody really sure just who they wanna be

But everybody has a place and time
A chance to live
A need to find
We all got somethin' that we care about
I propose you find it out

It's not in a book
Or a magazine
Or the stars who guide our fortunes on the silver screen
Nobody knows
It's up to me
Ain't nobody who can say it like it outght to be

I see my future at the rainbow's end
Happy hours
Timeless friends
And if I ever chance to find my way
Rest assured
I will stay

You may see your life as a compromise
You may live to find the promise dancin' in your eyes

It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven

Fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers

You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven

Michel Legrand,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

Michel Legrand,"Il avait de grands yeux très clairs
Où parfois passaient des éclairs
Comme au ciel passent des orages.
Il était plein de tatouages
Que j'ai jamais très bien compris.
Son cou portait ""Pas vu, pas pris.""
Sur son cœur on lisait ""Personne""
Sur son bras droit un mot ""Raisonne"".

Je sais pas son nom, je ne sais rien de lui.
Il m'a aimée toute la nuit,
Mon légionnaire!
Et me laissant à mon destin,
Il est parti dans le matin
Plein de lumière!
Il était mince, il était beau,
Il sentait bon le sable chaud,
Mon légionnaire!
Y avait du soleil sur son front
Qui mettait dans ses cheveux blonds
De la lumière!

Bonheur perdu, bonheur enfui,
Toujours je pense à cette nuit
Et l'envie de sa peau me ronge.
Parfois je pleure et puis je songe
Que lorsqu'il était sur mon cœur,
J'aurais dû crier mon bonheur
Mais je n'ai rien osé lui dire.
J'avais peur de le voir sourire!

Je sais pas son nom, je ne sais rien de lui.
Il m'a aimée toute la nuit,
Mon légionnaire!
Et me laissant à mon destin,
Il est parti dans le matin
Plein de lumière!

On l'a trouvé dans le désert.
Il avait ses beaux yeux ouverts.
Dans le ciel, passaient des nuages.
Il a montré ses tatouages
En souriant et il a dit,
Montrant son cou ""Pas vu, pas pris""
Montrant son cœur ""Ici, personne.""
Il ne savait pas, Je lui pardonne.

Je rêvais pourtant que le destin
Me ramènerait un beau matin
Mon légionnaire,
Qu'on s'en irait seuls tous les deux
Dans quelque pays merveilleux
Plein de lumière!
Il était mince, il était beau,
On l'a mis sous le sable chaud

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,

Michel Legrand,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind [From the Thomas Crown Affair]
Michel Legrand,"Que l'on me pende,
si je n'ai pas rêvé
je me demande
si je n'ai pas trouvé
l'amour au passage
celui qui rend fou les plus sages.
J'ai bien cru reconnaître son regard.

Tant de jeunesse,
de grâce et de beauté,
tant de tendresse
tant de sérénité.
Ma vie dépendra d'elle,
je n'existerai que pour elle
il faut que m'appartienne son amour.

Je n'attendais plus rien
et je désespérais.
Je vivais tant mal que bien
lorsqu'elle m'apparaît
plus belle qu'un ange
parmi nous descendu
je donnerais ma vie en échange
quitte à être pendu.

Michel Legrand,"A peine arrivée, avec tes idées, avec ta façon de dire non.
Tu débarques dans ma vie comme un boulet de canon.
Mais tu es tellement jolie, tu prends tellement de proportions.
Qu'c'est la révolution 1789.

Tu prends les habitudes, tu les flanques au panier.
Tu prends mon vieux fauteuil, mon portefeuille.
Tu les jettes par la fenêtre et tu ne veux rien reconnaître.
De tout ce qui était là bien avant toi:
Mon vieux pyjama, mon lit, ma pipe et mon tabac.
Tu ne veux plus voir tout ça.
Et tu décroches les rideaux, et tu les jettes à l'eau.
Avec du rideau vieux on fait du neuf.
C'est 1789.

Et tu me barricades, et j'en prends pour mon grade.
On s'croirait à l'époque des sans culottes.
Ils avaient pris la Bastille pour libérer leurs enfants.
Toi tu t'en prends à la vie.

Michel Legrand,"The sea goes on forever
The sky goes on forever
It's all a vast unmeasured shore
 
If you just think about it
The waves are always sighin'
The sea birds always cryin'

If I could I would take up the sea
Join hands with the sky
I'd melt with the shore
They're part of all I adore
And all the love we will share
One moment more, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
Ahh, the sea goes on forever
The sky goes on forever
It's something no-one can deny
If they go on forever
And they go on forever

Then why not you and I?
Like sea and sky
Sea and sky
Sea and sky",Sea and Sky
