K's Choice,"I'm about to tell you about a man I've known 
Since I've been able to open up a refrigerator 
I am wondering today in the sun on a boat to Dover 
Could you freeze me in and defrost me when it's over 

Mr. Freeze  I feel your chill 
As I inhale the urge to kill all my emotions 
I ask you please  but all you do is make me sneeze 
Mr. Freeze 

I am wondering today in the sun on a boat to Dover 
Whose shadow it is that appears as I bend over 
It's Mr. Freeze, I hear no sound 
As I focus on the amount of my emotions 

I ask you please, take the lead or let me bleed 
Mr. Freeze 
My temperature is very low now; you're here 
But you're not welcome any longer 

I will release Mr. Freeze 
No bangs no yells, merely the sea 
Is Mr. Freeze inside of me
Is Mr. Freeze inside of me
Is Mr. Freeze inside of me

I am wondering today in the sun on a boat to Dover 
How it comes that I feel so high when I ought to feel lower",Mr. Freeze
K's Choice,"Oohoo (19x)

Breath it in and breath it out

and pass it on it's almost out

We're so creative and so much more

We're high above  but on the floor

Chorus1: It's not a habit  it's cool

I feel alive

If you don't have it your on

the other side

The deeper you stick it in your vein

The deeper the thoughts there's no more pain

I'm in heaven  I'm a god

I'm everywhere  I feel so hot

Chorus2: It's not a habit, it's cool

I feel alive

If you don't have it your on

the other side

I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)

Oohoo (8x)

It's over now, I'm cold, alone

I'm just a person on my own

Nothing means a thing to me

Oh, nothing means a thing to me

Chorus2

Free me, leave me

Watch me as I'm going down

Free me, see me

Look at me I'm falling

And I'm falling.........

It is not a habit, it is cool

I feel alive I feel.......

It is not a habit, it is cool

I feel alive

Chorus2

I'm not an addict, I'm not an addict, I'm not an addict.",Not an Addict
K's Choice,"The thought of you and me and me and you 
It's clear  it's blurry 
Your head  my mind  your mind  my head  as one 
It's real  the foolish worry 

I feel you and you feel me as I feel you 
It's good  it's scary 
The speed  the heat  it's deep  and steep 
It's light but hard to carry 

Listen when I'm silent there's a 
Sound that only you can hear 
Listen when it's quiet I know 
You can hear it  cover up your ears 

Cover up your ears 
Your hands, my mouth, your mouth, my hands 
The weight of what we're thinking 
No words, the air we breathe 

It's not liquid, but we're drinking 
Listen when I'm silent there's a 
Sound that only you can hear 
Listen when it's quiet I know 

You can hear it, cover up your ears 
Cover up your ears 
Listen when I'm silent there's a 
Sound that only you can hear 

A sound that only you can hear 
A sound that only you can hear 
A sound that only you can hear",A Sound That Only You Can Hear
K's Choice,"I don't know who you are
But you seem very nice
So will you talk to me
Shall I tell you a story
Shall I tell you a dream
They think I'm crazy
They don't know that I like it here
It's nice in here
I get everything for free
Have you been here before
Shall I show you around
It's really pretty
Have you come here to stay
Well you sure picked a day
My name is Billy
It's my birthday, you're invited
To my party down the hall
Where I'll go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be I'll never know
But I am sure that I'll get everything for free
I'm not troubled or sad
I'm just ready for bed
It's been a long day
Before they switch off the lights
That truly was a delight
They think I'm crazy
They don't know that I like it here
It's nice in here
I get everything for free
Where I'll go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be I'll never know
But I am sure that I'll get everything for free
Where I'll go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be I'll never know
But I am sure that I'll get everything for free
everything for free
I don't know who you are
But you seem very nice
So will you talk to me
Have you been here before
Well you sure picked a day
they think I'm crazy",Everything for Free
K's Choice,"If I could look beyond your face 
And photograph your hidden place 
Would I find you smiling in the picture 

I don't know what you want 
Because you don't know, 
So what's the point of asking 

You're almost happy 
Almost content 
But your head hurts 

Far too many ways to go 
We learn so much but never know 
Where to look 
Or when we should stop looking 

I can love the whole of you. 
The poetry I stole from you 
And hide inside my stomach 

You're almost happy 
Almost content 
But your head hurts 

It's easy to get lost in you 
And fall asleep inside of you 
I want to return to you 
A reason to be here 
A reason to be here 

No I don't know what you want 
And you don't know 
So what's the point of asking 

You're almost happy 
Almost content 
But your head hurts",Almost Happy
K's Choice,"Oh wee 
My darlin' 
Can I make love to you tonight 
Sweetheart 
I will do you right 
I can make you feel so good 
I'm in the mood to make love tonight",Intro
K's Choice,"Cracked this morning worst and weak
Tears roll down from inside my cheek
Strange timing opportunity knocks
Sun comes up, paradox

Take the whole part out this wine
Take a rope and tie these
Thoughts of mine down
Until I'm fine

Don't ask me if I'm hungry
I'm not sick
Something's tearing me up
Brick by brick

And I feel guilty as I sigh
I'm feeling guilty, why do I?

Take your hands out of mine
Take a rope and tie these
Thoughts of mine down
Until I'm fine

Cracked this morning worse and sad
Or have I already told you that
Forget my plans to grow a vine
You weren't dressed to burn these thoughts of mine
Until I'm fine, until I'm fine
",Until I'm Fine [#]

K-Camp,"Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
I can see they watching, counting pockets, but what's new?
She know when I call it's for a reason, so come through
Nothing 'bout me change except these bitches n that coupe
Except these bitches n that coupe
Ain't too many loyal niggas, I just know a few
I'm telling nothing but the truth
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do

Used to keep money in a shoe box
Now I'm pulling up like tube socks
Went from a dollar to a few knots
Got me paying rent on 'bout two spots
They don't understand what my crew got
Remember long talks with my big bruh Cam
Young wild niggas in the bend selling grams
Man the pain and the struggle, man, that made me who I am
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
Jumped off that porch, I changed my mindset and my view
Reasons why you hate to see me win, I wish I knew
Came straight out that mud
You just don't know what I've been through
Look really no time for the talk, nigga I ain't got free time
Now-a-days I be all over green like the mothafuckin' d-line
And I ain't got time for the hoe when I barely got me time
Just give me a blunt and booth, mothafucka I'll be fine

Trill OG, I'm riding lowkey
With my hat low and my deuce up
Smoking on me some killer kush
My young partner pouring up that juice up
Doing me, so keep doing you
'Cause I ain't down with what you in to
See me, I'm a trill nigga through and through
And I'm out here looking for the chewing to
That's word to skinny pimp
Just a gangster walking with a limp
And you know I got no love for a simp
Posted up, nigga, eating steak and shrimp
Lil bitch got my knife and I got my fork
Benz outside and it's valet parked
Blunt rolled up and I'm 'bout to spark
In the city lights, I smash out in the dark
Can't be but who I am
Got to represent for my fam
Cadillac doors still getting slammed
Don't like it, sorry don't give a damn
Still down, still trill
Gon' be that way 'til I'm dead and gone
For PA I'm putting on with my candy paint
And my shiny chrome, come on

K-Camp,"I was six years old
Riding shotgun in a old school with my dad
Memories that I hold on to
'Cause really those the only ones that I had
They used to call me Lil' Rock
Skinny big head nigga with a rock
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hard
Even though my fam used to keep the grams in the socks, damn
It was me, lil Brandon and Nene
Outside running wild, fuck TV
On 13th all the way the 49th and Chambers
Shout out to my lil cuz Veve
And my uncle Jerome
One time for my uncle Jerome
In the basement smoking cigarettes with Tyrique
I think we did that when unc wasn't home
47th and Lloyd, first time I got jumped on the porch
Hit the oldest one with the one two, bink bink
Other one ran up, left his ass right there on the porch
Hell is you saying? Lil Jeff turned me into a man
That was big bro, that was big cuz
Everything to a nigga now he gone
Guess God had a plan, I don't understand
Lord why you do me this way? You live and you learn
Them tables will turn, them bridges will burn
But through it all, just make a way
I'm here to stay and I'ma do it for my city like the mayor
Real north-side nigga living life like my grandaddy Charles
He the reason why a nigga a player

Let me talk to 'em
Plenty nights when I felt all alone, nobody to lean on
Listen up, let me tell you how it feel
Look, I just tell it how it is, everybody claim they real
On the real these niggas ain't ever been real
I'm just living my life, I'm just doing my thang
Same nigga from the jump
Baby I ain't gon' change
Baby I ain't gon' change
Baby I ain't gon' change

Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be shit, is the shit,
Who knew?
Still ridin' 'round with my day one niggas
We don't need new niggas in the crew
One time for my nigga Dan
That was my first friend second grade, Mrs. Blue
I don't do too much, nigga just say what's up, man salute when you see me
These niggas upset 'cause they heard I got next
I keep cheese like Fellini's
Back in the day I used to be a hot head
Like I'm walkin' 'round with a beanie
In the middle of the summer
I'm just tryna score, nigga, no time to fumble
It's game time, everybody on ten
We just tryna get this money at the same time
I ain't claimin' what ain't mine
Got your girl on the edge like the state line
Ain't no mo play time
We just tryna get it off the muscle
Fighting for the money, how much hustle
I'ma get my bitch to respect my hustle forreal
Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit
Is the shit, who knew
Look, I'm just livin' my life, I'm just doin' my thang
Same nigga from the jump

What's the point of getting that money?
Money ain't money, if your life don't change
What's the point of pushing that whip
If you ain't changing lanes?
What's the point of having any girl
If your bitch don't change?
What's the point of staying the same
If everything around you change?
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed
If everything around you changed
All I need is change

You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be here
You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be here",Change
K-Camp,"Look, shit get better with time
You ever heard me say one lie in my rhyme?
Been doing a lot of thinking and a whole lot of praying
It's my only way to vent, what the hell is you saying?
Feel like I got a lot of people that's depending on me
Built a solid foundation, put the building on me
You remind me of myself so why you tripping on me?
I remember how it felt when my tank was on E
I remember how it felt when the money was low
Dirty dishes in the sink, mouse traps on the floor
Need to buy a bakery, the way I'm after the dough
Wonder why the hating me, I just practice and go
One thing I learned, time don't wait for nobody
Love the feeling I can finally tell my momma I got it
Love the feeling I can finally take a look in my wallet
See some hunnids in that mothafucka, maybe I'm wilding

R.I.P. aunt Randie, I got something to say
Keep ya head up unc, trust the lord and your faith
Momma just told me grandma ain't doing too well
Ever since she gave me hope, I've been giving them hell
Back then with the juice jugs shooting the cans
Where I come from, from niggas shooting they mans
Where I come from, nigga, nobody safe
Where I come from, like no other place
And I love that I'm just trying to be around where the love at
Niggas beefing over bitches, we above that
I ain't smoked all day, where the drugs at?
Shawty tryna go some rounds, where my gloves at?
Even though you wasn't around, I can't blame you
You is who you is, I can never change you
Life lessons that will show me what the game do
It made me who I am so I got to thank you

Shit get better with time
I said shit get better with time
Shit get better with time
Shit get better with time
Let's go

Hold up, wait can't believe they want more
30 cent bag of chips on the corner store
Doing 'bout a hunnid, youngin' always on go
You say you getting pussy, why you stressing 'bout a ho?
Nigga pay attention, I'm the man on the low
Fuck that shit, I'm the man on the high
Last time I checked, the only time I got fooled
When R Kelly told me he believed he could fly",Control

But don't worry, girl I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, girl I'm good
What's in the past gon' stay there
I can't make the same mistakes therefore I'm good
I told a thousand lies to prevent the cries
Now it's good bye 'cause I realized I'm good
Now I done moved on, feelings gone
Oh I'm good

She say that I'm acting different
She say I'm not the same nigga
Last time I checked when I looked in the mirror
Bitch I was the same nigga
But I do apologize for all them times I made you cry
Even though I tried to make that bullshit work
Guess we couldn't see eye to eye
And I'm not the guy that you fantasize
You couldn't hold on 'cause I'm on the rise
Now I got a new bitch, don't act surprised
I'm just a young nigga tryna multiply
My bankroll, and I know I'm not perfect at all
Just want to know are you there when I fall?
If ain't real I don't want it at all
Will you be there when I call?

When it rains I think of you
When all them nights that I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?
Turned your back

I just hope that you happy
I just hope that you happy
And I ain't gon' lie yeah it be some nights
When I really do miss you
But I just hope that you happy
I just hope that you happy
But he can't fuck you like I do
Can't fuck you like I do
Lick you up, now turn your ass around
And I hit it from the back like boom
I done packed my bags and my suitcase full
Baby ain't no room
So I ain't really worried about you
I ain't really worried about you
But I know

When it rains I think of you
When all them nights that I was there with you
Through the pain, why you do me like that?

Now it's good bye 'cause I realized I'm good
Now I done moved on, feelings gone
Oh I'm good

I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I heard she want love, I don't believe that
'Cause everywhere I go these hoes be the same
She really asking where the cheese at
It really ain't nothing for me to pick your brain
But I learned
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
She don't know my name, she just see the chains
And she want the fame, girl stay in yo lane
She must love the pain 'cause she will never change
I thought you was different, maybe I was trippin'
Maybe I was trippin', learn from my mistakes
You can get replaced, look at me I'm straight
But I learned
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same
I swear they all the same, I swear they all the same

Looking for CC, oh how she need me
That bitch still basic, still rocking BB
Laughing like hehe, how can I call it?
Oh I just love my lil bitch from New Orleans
I-20 pushing, I know you looking
Her presence, I cherish, my bitch is so gorgeous
Shawty I'm pouring the gin and the juice
You on my mind, I don't know what to do
But I know if she fuck up, then we through
But right now I'm still fucking with you

Rolling down the street with my shades on
Sippin' on gin and juice
I don't understand, girl, what you waiting on
You got me trippin' on you
I said rollin' down the street with my shades on
Sippin' on gin and juice
I don't understand, girl, what you waiting on
You got me trippin' on you
Got me trippin' on you, you, you
Got me trippin' on you, you, you
Sippin' on gin and juice, juice, juice
Got me trippin' on you, you, you

All up in a nigga face with the same game
Let me tell you what I'm gon' do
I hop on my sike life, night life
Nigga make a dream come true for you
Now turn the beat down G style
Everybody know my heat go boom
Splash and mash and pictures flashing
Man my life so cool
Let me get back to the camp
I'm lamping out, cookies in the bag
And the vast amounts, mixed with peaches and cream
Creep on the scene
Crip nigga with the thief hit the scene
In the war deep with the team
Late night creep on 'em, I mean
Hit 'em with lot botta bing
All about the money and the green
Top down, drop down on 'em clean

Rolling down the street with my shades on
Sippin' on gin and juice
I don't understand, girl, what you waiting on
You got me trippin' on you
I said rollin' down the street with my shades on
Sippin' on gin and juice
I don't understand, girl, what you waiting on
You got me trippin' on you
Got me trippin' on you, you, you
Got me trippin' on you, you, you
Sippin' on gin and juice, juice, juice
Got me trippin' on you, you, you",Rolling

It's not my birthday but I'm all over that cake

You know a young nigga too smooth like butter
Making all the plays, you can come join the huddle
I ain't saying shit like a dog with a muzzle
Figured out the game, got the pieces to the puzzle
Got a new bitch, she ain't got no standards
Magic City Monday, baby welcome to Atlanta
Shawty got flavor, she remind me of a Fanta
Take her to the H, put the deuce in a Fanta
Excuse me but I'm on right now
She only want a nigga 'cause I'm on right now

It ain't no problem, anytime we can do it
Light another L, I'm just living through the music
If I throw it at you, promise that you won't lose it
Claiming you gon' ride, baby you just got to prove it
Sipping on that purple drank, got 'em moving slow
Fuck the other side, I'ma get it 'til it's over

Pouring up the Hennessy 'til it's running over

You ain't really who you say you is
Living life with that mask on when them hunger pains
I'll have a savage nigga running in your shit
With no mask on, and I'm past gone
Not fearing nobody from God, I speak this shit from my heart
Bitches and money tear niggas apart
I been this way from the start
Long road but I learned quick
You the type to always run yo mouth
Always talk about it but never earn shit
I'm on my bridge, never burn shit
Next to Diddy Kenny Burns shit
If you don't know you better learn quick
I hold my hundreds with a firm grip
Hold my hundreds with a firm grip
Always busy like the West End

These millions, anybody a hitter
Give them a mission and pistol
'Cause you come up and holla
That don't make you my nigga
How many niggas you owe, how many niggas you know
That was like brothers before, then fell out 'bout a ho
If I knew my nigga was getting high
Then he couldn't buy it from me
You my lil nigga, lil nigga money no value to me
I took lil Keion out the hood and changed his life foreal
Ask him you can post up on this hill or go to Beverly Hills
It's on you, if you ain't 'bout that action, why the fuck you lie?
If you the realest nigga, then who the fuck am I?

I'm the type that want to see you rich
You the type to go blow your check
Just for Instagram and a sneaky bitch
I'm the type to pull off the lot
Then look at yo then say you can too
I can't wait for my nigga Bo
To bust down that block in a two door coupe
There go twelve, higher than I ever been
Mambo hide that scale

You niggas too frail
You might break my heart
But you can't break this truth I tell
Real niggas do cry too
When my album drop, hope you buy two
When it's all done I'mma die true

By the fruit that it bears

I see my field is yielding

Float away on midnight dreams 
And we don't need a magic potion 
So we can live inside our dreams

On this song because 
Me and my mama was watching the news the other day and 
We saw a lot of thangs that's goin' on in the world 
And mama just happen to just come up with some lyrics to a song 
She said ""I want y'all to sing this song for me on this CD 
Cuz y'all never sang a song for me before"" 
And ah, this was written by mama 
And this is what mama told me to tell y'all 
She said 

We all need that kind of love 
That special love 
The love from above 

We all need that kind of love 
That special love 
The love from above 

Look into the mirror of life 
And tell me what you see 
I see people all over the world 
Who needs to know the meaning of love 

Let me tell you what real love is all about 
If you see a man down, don't step on him 
Reach down and pick him up 
Pick him up, give him a helping hand 

We all need that kind of love 
That special love 
The love from above 

We all need that kind of love 
That special love 
The love from above 

Oh, see that mother over there 
Strugglin' to survive 
She has about five little children 
No food or clothes to put on their backs 

And what you should do 
If you see somebody like that 
You should go up to them 
Lend them a helping hand 
Offer a roof over their head 
'Cause the world is in need of love like that 

We all need that kind of love 
That special love 
The love from above 

We all need that kind of love 
That special love 
The love from above 

K-Ci help me, K-Ci help me 
Tell 'em where we need love 
USA, Africa, Bosnia, Ethiopia 
Korea and China, even Iraq too 
Even in Haiti 
That's what we all need

It's mental and it's spiritual and
We are spirits needing
One last time

The love I have inside
I've gotta have you one last time

And girl a life together and share the joy of children forever

That I want the world to see
There will always be the space in my soul
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me
Inside of me

Why deep in love of you like I do
Place your hand on my heart
I know it beats for you
Said I know I won't have a world without you
I said my life is so incomplete
Until I see you

That I want the world to see
There will always be the space in my soul 
Until you fill this emptiness inside of me

Cause I don't even sleep
They say I'm looking weak
But everything they say is true
Girl I can't make it without you
And I don't know which way to go 
Up or down, fast or slow
So I think it's time for me to go away 
And I know it sounds crazy
But your not my lady anymore

Until you took your love away (love away)

If I die I know I'd still look over you
Loving you, forever and forever, no need to
Heaven is not that far away
Heaven is not to far away
I can still see your precious face
Said I might have been a fool, think this way would make you gladder
When I look down on you I can see I made you sad
It's too late for me to change it
Only God can explain it

Yeah that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)
You know what time it is (maybe it's the thug in me)

By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools

That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on

Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
But do it lightly; cause that excites me to let it pop
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night

Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin me
I'm goin deep, it's the thug in me; so whatchu sayin girl?

A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
Got a lot of thug in me, that I want to put in you

It's so strong niggaz in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin, tongue kissin as I hit it from the back
With the bed ringin (haha)

Give me space as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I drive when they kick the bass
Love fuckin in tha mo'nin
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone

Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like, blindfolded
I'm cold do it real nice - that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me

I pull ya hair while we fuckin in the chair, when ya lovin me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, can get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you

Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder, I make the room rumble
In and out long stroke, hold ya breath now
Close your eyes deep throat - did you like it?

Oooh I'm excited!
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited - c'mon now
Let me see ya shake your rump, tell me
How long will it take to cum, havin fun

Do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way

Yeah baby it's a price to pay, only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash came

Drugged out with this motherfuckin thug in you

Why, am I here all alone?
Why, did I trust you for so damn long?

When all the love that I have is for you
And how can I feel again?
With all the drama you put me through
And how can I trust?
With all of the lying it's hard to do
How can I go on?
How can I ever fall in love again?
How can I ever get to feel again?
How can I ever get to trust you again?

Same thing with the squad, what you think on Bleek
Beef? Come on dog who you think gon bleed
Not Mac, never slip in the club
4/5th in the club, told why'all never slip in the club

Niggas hit like shit, how that get in the club
You think I'm playin when I'm sayin shit'll drip in the club?
Man I come to turn out the show, turn out a hoe
Before I bounce, burn an ounce of 'dro

Throw back an ounce of snow, bounce with dough
Squad deep, all with heat, and the bouncers know
Back the fuck up dog or the rounds'll blow
Man a thug in the club, why'all know how it go, shit

J'ai plus le moindre soucis
J'ai le mal qui fuit,
Tu donnes un son à ma vie
Et puis j' sais pas qu'est-ce qui s' passe,
T'as ce regard dans la face
Qui me ramène à la case départ, là où j' suis parti,
Nous ramène à la soirée do bar quand on est sortis
Et c'est cette même complicité qui s'installe,
Ou quand on est sur la scène
Et qu'on brille sous la même étoile
Quand ta voix croise la mienne, que j'ai ta soul dans mes veines
Comme on va être cool dans les tiennes
Femme t'es belle mais quand tu chantes t'es sexy,
Flash sur elle, rock, soul baby

Complice on leur donne un bon son, like
A la T.V., Mary J.Blige glamourous, ton style et ton charme t'es fabulous
Un délice pour un macadam
Hm baby baby, si tu savais comme j'te hm baby baby
Crois-moi que l'atmosphère est parfaite,
Et plus tu chantes, plus je j' glisse sur la pente et j'perds la tête
Deux vies, deux voix qui s' rencontrent
Deux histoires qui se racontent
Une chanson pour le dire,
Y'a les mots, les images pour le décrire
Une belle rencontre à l'ancienne,
Prends un flash, y'a d' la magie sur scène,
Le rideau tombe et c'est terminé
Une belle collabo, des mots sur une feuille, pour se rappeler

Donne-moi ton cœur,
Donne-moi ton corps,
Donne-moi ta soul,
Ton rock'n'roll
Je veux une femme like you
Un homme like you

Donne-moi ton cœur baby,
Ton corps baby hey
Donne-moi ton bon vieux funk,
Ton rock baby,
Ta soul baby hey
Chante avec moi, je veux une femme like you

Sans prix, sans travail, simplement, contempler les palmiers

S’allonger sur le sable sans taper d’attitudes,
Loin des lois des règles et des clichés,
Ici l'jeu est simple, pas besoin d'tricher

C’est pour ça que j’ai besoin de changer d’atmosphère,

Dans le calme, simplement reprendre mes énergies,
Décrocher, de la vie de paillettes et des trophées,

Et garder la tête froide, se regarder dans le miroir 
En étant fier du reflet qu’il donne à ce stade,
Voilà ce que je viens chercher ici,
Sous le soleil face à la mer les vérités de la simple vie
Ne voir que l’essentiel, regarder la vie sous sa façade la plus belle
Faut pas que je m’égare, faut pas que je perde le nord,

Des corps à corps endiablés, des danses spéciales en privé
Des strings léopard qui volent au dessus des rideaux fermés
Les esprits se réchauffent, la soirée s'enlamme
J'aurais trés bien vu Cauet ici tomber pour Clara Morgane
Et de l'autre côté do bar, mes homies jouent au poker
Et là encore autour d'eux des femmes déguisées en joker
Qui strippent ardement, à chaque coup de brelan
Et si le flush tombe, la danse est faite spécialement

On parle de ceux qui ne sont jamais partis, ceux qui sont restés
Malgré les coups et les colères, malgré les claques et les galères
Ceux qui se rappèleront toujours du mot ""amitié""
Ceux qui te parlent et que leur regard est sincère
Ceux qui te prennent sur leur dos pour sauter une barrière
Ceux qui ne connaissent pas la peur quand on marche ensemble
Ceux qui on le même cri la même foi même quand le cœur tremble
Mais ce monde a perdu tous sens d'unité
Tout sens d'humilité, le bon sens c'est arrêté
Les soldats tombent la trahison en bouche
Mort de regret, et le soleil se couche
Sur la nuit de ceux qui avaient leur noms gravés dans leur prières
Qui aurait pu dire aujourd'hui qu'ils ont pavé leur vie d'hier?

On sait que trop donner, peut nous revenir en mépris
On sait que tout ce qui monte redescend
Alors on ne prends rien pour acquis et on avance à pas prudents
Dans les hauts, dans les bas, faut rester entier
S'il y a des vents qui soufflent, frère, faut rester ancré

K-Maro,"Donne-moi ton cœur, baby
Ton corps baby, hey
Donne-moi ton bon vieux funk
Ton rock, baby
Ta soul baby, hey
Chante avec moi, je veux une femme like you
Pour m'emmener au bout du monde, une femme like you
Hey
Donne-moi ton cœur, baby
Ton corps baby, hey
Donne-moi ton bon vieux funk
Ton rock, baby, ta soul, baby, hey
Chante avec moi, je veux un homme like you
Bad boy tu sais que tu m'plais, un homme like you
Hey
Quand tu chantes, j'oublie
J'ai plus le moindre soucis
J'ai le mal qui fuit
Tu donnes un son à ma vie
Et puis j'sais pas qu'est-ce qui s'passe
T'as ce regard dans la face
Qui me ramène à la case départ, là où j'suis parti
Nous ramène à la soirée du bar quand on est sortis
Et c'est cette même complicité qui s'installe
Ou quand on est sur la scène
Et qu'on brille sous la même étoile
Quand ta voix croise la mienne, que j'ai ta soul dans mes veines
Comme on va être cool dans les tiennes
Femme, t'es belle, mais quand tu chantes, t'es sexy
Flash sur elle, rock, soul, baby

Complice on leur donne un bon son, like
À la T.V., Mary J. Blige glamourous, ton style et ton charme t'es fabulous
Un délice pour un macadam
Mhhm baby baby, si tu savais comme j'te mhhm baby baby
Crois-moi que l'atmosphère est parfaite
Et plus tu chantes, plus je j'glisse sur la pente et j'perds la tête
Deux vies, deux voix qui s'rencontrent
Deux histoires qui se racontent
Une chanson pour le dire
Y'a les mots, les images pour le décrire
Une belle rencontre à l'ancienne
Prends un flash! Y'a d'la magie sur scène
Le rideau tombe et c'est terminé
Une belle collabo, des mots sur une feuille, pour se rappeler

Donne-moi ton cœur
Donne-moi ton corps
Donne-moi ta soul
Ton rock'n'roll
Je veux une femme like you
Un homme like you",Femme Like U

J'ai besoin d'une femme dans ma vie
Qui me comprend, qui m'aime et me suis
Après tout ce que j'pourrai m'offrir
Tout ce que j'pourrai m'acheter
Tout ce que j'pourrai écrire en un mot

J'ai besoin de ce gangster love
Le vrai, le pur, la complicité entre 2 qui donne à crazy real love
Plus de parure, plus de décor
J'veux des promesses sur une bague en or

K-Maro,"J'ai vu des choses mon vieux, des choses qui font mal
J'ai vu des larmes qui coulent, des enfants qui ont mal
On n'a le droit de s'en foutre, c'est rien de banal
Le temps qui passe pour nous, pour eux est fatal

Mais, on n'est pas la pour la pitié
On n'est pas la pour pleurer leur sort
Je voulais que cette chanson leur soit dédiée
Que tous ensemble, pour eux, on y croit encore

Aucune raison n'est bonne pour un enfant de souffrir
Il n'y a pas de raison pour une âme de ne pas sourire
Mais la vie a fait que pour certains ce n'est pas pareil
Il y en a qui viennent au monde déjà prêts pour

Un long sommeil
C'est triste, et il faut faire quelque chose
Il faut qu'on s'implique dans de petites et simples choses
Qui pour eux font la difference
Un sourire aux lèvres, un message de l'espérance

Lève ta main pour ces princes des ghettos
Qui ne voient que l'ampleur de l'étau
Qui tous les jours se battent pour survivre
En espérant un jour ne plus soufrir

Lève ta main pour ces petits princes de la rue
Qui ne voient que leur destin perdu
Et simplement que l'on se souvienne
Que pour tout le monde la vie n'est pas la même

La cicatrice reste, quand marquée sur un enfant
Mais leur visage s'illumine, à chaque main qu'on leur tend
Tu sais pour eux le bonheur ne tient à rien
Si je pouvais en faire sourire rien qu'un

Je me sentirais déjà bien
Ces enfants de la famine
Ces enfants des terres hostiles
Ces gosses qui ne l'ont pas choisi

Mais qui en portent des traces indélébiles
Parle pour eux mon gars, prie pour eux mon gars
Plus tu ne manques de rien et plus il
Y en a pour qui ça s'arrête là

C'est la vie qui l'a choisi ainsi
Sans trop savoir qui en paierait le prix
Et coulent des larmes sous un ciel gris
Malheureusement ce sont eux qu'on oublie

En espérant qu'un jour les choses changent
C'est déjà bien qu'ensemble on y pense
Surtout que je sais qu'il aurait pu être le mien
Ce petit prince triste qui me tend la main

Lève ta main pour ces petits princes de la rue
Qui ne voient que leur destin perdu
Et simplement que l'on se souvienne
Que pour tout le monde la vie n'est pas la même

La cicatrice reste, quand marquée sur un enfant
Mais leur visage s'illumine, a chaque main qu'on leur tend
Tu sais pour eux le bohneur ne tient à rien
Si je pouvais en faire sourire rien qu'un

Lève ta main pour ces petits princes de la rue
Qui ne voient que leur destin perdu
Et simplement que l'on se souvienne
Que pour tout le monde la vie n'est pas la même

Avec des choses à dire
Tchec, Tchec
C'est ma vie

Que dieu me pardonne
Si j'ai toujours voulu vivre ma vie comme j'voulais
Sans en parler, personne
N'avait jamais vraiment compris tout ce
Don't j'ai pu manquer étant tout petit

Et j'en ai gardé des séquelles
J'ai fait le bien, le mal j'voulais voler d'mes propres ailes
J'en ai chier sur le système, pourquoi la guerre m'a pris
10 ans d'ma vie sans parler même

Ça m'fous la rage, et ça m'donne l'envie d'réussir
Le jour où j'ai tourné la page, j'me suis dit qu'plus
Rien pouvait me détruire

Et c'est c'qui fait de moi qui j'suis aujourd'hui
Qui fait que je me bat peut importe le prix
Et c'est c'qui fait que je n'ai peur de rien
J'suis pas là pour rien, j'reprendrais c'qu'on m'a prit

Si je profite un peu trop de c'que j'ai aujourd'hui qui est un peu trop
La vie me regarde, je lui tire chaque sourire
Mon seul péché aujourd'hui c'est d'réussir

J'fait ma vie comme je la rêvais sous les bombes
Quand j'avais rien je le dit j'en ai pas honte
J'ai bosser comme un chien pour tout reconstruire
Et j'en donne en retour à ceux qui ça peut servir

Mon nom, mes origines, mon sang
Font que j'regarde droit devant
Plus rien n'peut m'stoper maintenant
Trop tard je fonce, t'inquiète maman

J'ai des masses de choses à faire
Dans ma tête tout est bien clair
J'y vais pour le maximum
Et j'te ramène de quoi être fier

God, oh God
Have trust in You
God, oh God
Have trust in You

God, oh God
Have trust in You
God, oh God
Have trust in You

Que dieu me pardonne
De pas donner assez de temps à ceux qu'j'aime
De pas leur dire assez souvent que j'les aiment
De n'avoir la tête que dans mes affaires
D'essayer toujours de valoir plus cher

C'est la vie qu'j'a choisi, y a des hauts, y a des bas
C'est l'chemin que j'ai pris why a des riques a chaque pas
Je le vis tout les jours et j'suis fier d'être comme là
Et c'est comme ça, et c'est comme ça

V'est ma vie, all eyes on you
Et maintenant j'c'est qu'on me regarde
All eyes on you
Je c'est c'qui m'restera faire la
J'suis pas là pour rien

C'est la vie qu'j'ai
(All eyes on you)
Choisi, y a des hauts, y a des bas
(All eyes on you)
C'est l'chemin que j'ai pris y a des risques
À chaque pas

K-Maro,"Yes!

What goes around, comes around.
What can make you, can break you.
What can make you, can break you.

Yeah! Aha-a-Aha-a
Yeah!

If there's no history, there's no fuel for the victory
A wise man told me, ""Don't be a witness of your misery.
Call the shots for yourself. 
Make some moves for yourself
Don't try to be too cool, make some rules for yourself.
Play the game the way it's played but
Make sure you are in the right time at the right spot
Flip your money over like a gangster would do
But keep it strict legit. 
It's like a weapon to you.
Keep your head down grounded, look out for your people.
You don't want to walk alone but make sure you they walk legal.
Stay out of trouble, you'll be rich like hell
Every wealth has to double, don't start with them grails
You're a man know! No longer a kid walkin' on the ground
If you wanna be like Trumph, you're gonna start right now!""
That's exactly what he told me. 
On November, 17th 1996 was the beginning of my dream. 

Hey!

[Chorus: x2]
That's my way of showing love to the game
It's about who I am, it's not all about the fame.
Hey!
That's my way of showing love to the game
Stand up! 
That's my kid. 
Love it or leave it, 
Love it or leave it.

When's the last time you ever see a dude like this
I moved my shit, get back to the crew I did. 
Make stacks of a few ideas, that's who I is.
They can't do what I did, get-in.
So now I'm a post, so they won't do what'ey did
You're gonna fail, don't do that kid!
Run from niggas that shoot between your eye-lids.
You see it in the news, but that's what I lis' (listen)

How dare you criticize when I pour my soul
How dare you criticize when I pour my pain
How dare you criticize when I pour champaigne
Cause even there, I'm gonna see what pork and pain
It's my game! Fuck out of here, baby, it's my house!
You wan't me out. Smokin' some like Amy Whinehouse.
I'm like No-no.. No,I ain't goin' no-where!
You can't walk with me for sure, I'll put you on.

Hey!

[Chorus: x2]

""Life will eat you, life will beat you,
Life will treat you like shit, put the heat on you
Your best bet when the time is hard, is take you one shot.
Stand straight flip it back on the bar.
And let them think you're weak now. It's all good!
They never cared about the weak, just starvin' in the hood
And let them think on whatever they wanna think
Blink on whatever they wanna blink
But don't you lose your focus, 
You're 'bout to win your strongest blink

For every loss, remember, there's a victory 
And every victory is a part of your dynasty 
Loyalty to the game will serve you
Respect the one above you
But only show love to the ones who love you
That's the game
Love it or leave it.
A whole bunch of players, only a few can beat 'em""
That's exactly what he told me.
On November, 17th 1996 was the beginning of my dream. 

Hey!

k-os,"Like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky

Uh, stare out my window
Already know where I been though
They say life's like a stencil
At twelve years old I rock with a number two pencil
My mom used to say ""get your head out the sky""
Such a small fry, they didn't want me to fly
But I never cry, I just took a step
Peace to Josh, peace to Droops, lest we forget
Yo, slanging raps on the block, just to lick a shot
Other rappers aren't hot, just forget it
Right down to the bell before class
Every other One Dimension emcee wouldn't last
Mister Stally, where's my demo?
He said to let you know, young man, just let the truth be your ammo
Yep, another song to sing
And they soon come back bringing the dawn they bring, but

People think I'm crazy for thinking so high
I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky, no lie

Yo, it visits one time, there's only one line so you better be on time
Sifted the black in the back with the track
You could cruise in the Cadillac 'til they put the zap on 'em
You're not a friend to the end, you only come around when love is a trend
It's a spaceship, not a slave ship
And until your eyes spent so many wasted
Nights in a hotel, go tell it on the mountain
Oh yeah, mansion in public housing
It's a different kind of bouncing, from a distant star
But you all meet me at the bar

People think I'm crazy for thinking so high
I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky, no lie

This is not speak and spell but I ring the bell
You could tell that it's astro-Johnny Cash flow in an Astro van
Kicking rhymes in the back to our final destination but it's not on the map
You attack, but it's a little known fact
That I'd rather shoot stardust when it's on tap
This is dealing bigger claiming love at first glance
So think about a quote in advance, dance (dance)

No lie

I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky

k-os,"Yo, (here we go, come on)
Greetings to you all (here we go, come on)
We came millions of miles to be here with you tonight (here we go, come on)
And we're gonna bring a man up to the microphone right now (here we go, come on)
And goes by the name of uh, well he doesn't know (check it out come on yo)

Shape shifting, uplifting, lyrical vein here to terminate the bling bling
Six million ways to live, choose none
The devil's both left and right confusion
A new sun, a new earth has begun
Metabolical rates are changing, rearranging
This rhyme is entertaining and visually stimulating like an impressionist painting
Oooh, yo come follow me, what's the definition of a real MC?
Is it looking hard on mtv?
Or freestyling in a back street all-ey?
Muhammad, it's the return of the common
I'm bombing these rappers and dropping a hip hop megatron
From King Street to Eglington, we don't run
Cause when they got a mic, there's no need for a gun

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
It's all fortified so jump on it
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife
We rock from night, until morning

[Repeat x4]
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call

If you think about a thought, then you'll see that you're timeless
House the rhymeless, they're asleep like Linus
I find this, very stimulating to the mind
But drives me crazy at the same time
Am I this or that? human or black?
Extra terrestrial or right side of the tracks?
In fact, the shoes itself could be confusive
Here's a little story from the time that's illusive
I knew a girl by the name of Roxanne, met her in eighty-six
At the local band stand
New tracks, suit, fat laces white sneakers
Moving to the sound coming out of the speaker
Last week around Queen and John, I saw her at the corner with a business suit on
I said ""what's up girl? you still check the vibe?
Remember De La Soul? Diamond D? And the Tribe?""
She said ""no, no, I just don't listen
That stuff on the radio is not to transmission
Same beat, same lyrics, same song
I listen to my old school tapes to get it on""
I said ""word up girl? I know what you mean
It seems we're all trapped in the glitz and the gleam
The truth's just hidden for now, so don't sweat it
So here's a cassette"" and then I jetted!

[Chorus:Repeat x4]

[Repeat x4]
Come inside, there's no use hiding
Come inside, the sun is high

[Repeat x4]
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call

High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

Come inside, the sun is high",Neutroniks

It's the end of the jiggy era
People on the planet Earth are tired
In an effort to aid a great shipment millions of bodies incarnate (GET UP!)
To rock mic's

Complex, this hip hop alchemy
When I was a kid I watched Electric Company
Now I'm all grown living life to the bone
New tone, spaceship take me home
Back to the seventh sun the seventh one
When I drop patience, Kevin's Dun
This eloquent macula is black enough
To bring a shake to Dracula
Uh, I'm hitting them with synonym adrenaline
Then I send them to the kingdom of the heavens
A matter of time before this rhyme
Infiltrates the bloodstream into the mind
Of a man living a life in Babylonia
So lonely she went to California
Frisco, hypno's, get clothes
Crystals, take it back to the raw rap

(You, you blind baby. You're blind from the fact oh yeah cause you're
watching that garbage!)

She's a superstar
You can change the world

Yo, I got a lyrical shot aimed at the T. Dot
Telling me that you are, when you know that you're not
Uptown, chilling at the corner store
Thinking, ""Why the hell do I front, I'm hardcore""
Like Castro, master flows pass the golden links
Whatever you think its all old, you get it?
Whatever the cost I will not floss
Emcees act the boss they all get tossed
Off the plank
Hold the dank I don't burn
I got a lot to say but really lots to learn
Turn, baby you're just not concerned
Whatever earned, thinking of the most high earned
I flip with this some hit, some miss
Don't get fooled by lyrical ventriloquist the twist

Sing the anthem...sing it with me

I won't fear anymore more, hip-hop is back for sure sure
Cause it took our love away
Now she's come back to stay
I feel sorry for emcees cees

But the truth shall set them free free
Have no fear no no fear, oh no

It's the return of original man from outer space
The human race, is like eyes without a face
I pull ya car, I saw you try to fool God
And now you wanna switch up the game it's rather odd
Damn, I thought that they were down for mine
But alas a good woman is hard to find
So I get up, I'm really fed up with infidelity
This is my penalty for infiltrating with the melody
At times, I look at my face in the mirror
And wonder if the picture is clearer to me than to them
But then again, they sell crack to kids
That's what is, so I just attack the biz
And it's just my sole obligation
To unite this whole Hip-Hop nation
Face it, we're taking over your radio station
Hey Sid, this is the time for jubilation

[Chorus]

Now we can break it down like this
Or we can break it down like that
They stole Hip-Hop, come on let's take it back
To east coast stompin, rompin
Over the rhythm and then I hit 'em with the
Most beautiful jewels that shine through the darkness
Spark this, some are concerned with who's the hardest
Artist, call me the fluid MC
Slippin' through the cracks bring it back definitely
Now, who is the man that's forgotten his name
Living in shame but can't recall the place where he came from
The same one, dancing on your video screen
Hideous dreams, I can't believe we do it from cream, yo
But it's the anthem to turn back the tables, fables
Wack emcees working for labels
I'll see you all in the next life time
It's not Kevin, just a message from serious seven

Don't ask me why when they're coming from the sky
Just let it go, there's some things you'll never know X4

You wanna rap against me I'm a rap terminator
I'm getting mad props like on a movie set
And if the time runs out then ???
Take it to the end and...def with the record, def with the record

That life is mystical
Beautiful bliss-ful
Now, in troubled times
I find soul in reaching
What I'm seeking seems so far
Praise the world
My mother told me
That life's mechanical
So tyrannical
It blows my mind
Just what we'll be reaping
And weeping so help us god
Never knew that I
Could be looking why
Are so many
Breaking
Making castles of sand
Every man
Want to be the one
Want to be the one to be
King for a day but its slipping away
And I'm happy
Most melodical things I say
To release the pain
And cease the rain
In my brainstorm
I can't hide
From inside
Escape to, the outside
And I'll be flying away.

Everyday is just a struggle
We take till there's nothing left

For the rest that don't care this a message straight to your heart
Nothing you say now can turn me away
I'm walking the path, never-le me a stray
Many they hold mics I don't know what to say
What's going on today?
And you walk to fast
On the broken glass
On the smoking pass
Hoping that
Worshiping the cash
But it never lasts
Won't you ask
What can we be?
Can we be free?
Where can we go?

Yo, uh uh uh uh uh
This is the mission out a small time thing
Let me tell you bout what happened when the phone went
I was chillin' at the crib with this girl named Wise
She was kissin' my brain, caressin' my third eye
When the phone rang, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to forget it, ignore it, leave it
But just when things started goin' great
It rang again, I said hold up, wait
Picked up the phone, ""Yeah who the hell is this?""
Somebody said, ""This is serious business
Hip hop is dyin' it's all Darth Vader
So pick up your mic and swing your light sabre.""
The Skywalker, the fly talker from the T-dot
We got, beats and lyrics to get you up
Kick in the door, wavin' my ASR
Who got my back? In fact it's Figure Four
I keep it raw, cross the city just like gore
Rappers are claimin' to be hardcore
But never no more

Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it

When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it

There's only two digits; zero and number one
But some get fooled by countin' bullets in a gun
I make a run, with that renegade Red 1
We so close you can figure us cousins
So step up if you want to get taxed
Hip hop used to be black, but now it laxed
The brick cause they mostly spit like demonology
My psychology not defendant on pimpology
Cause pimps just react to things, men make em happen
This rappin' dedicated to soul clappin'
If you got soul, than The Infinite's in control
Stop using mine, people to legitimize
Yourself cause you raped the Earth and tell lies

It goes stop, don't make a move, just freeze
Instead of tellin' a lie, get down on your knees

Masters of the ceremony, is what we be
It goes stop, don't make a move, just freeze

Please, give up the mic to MC's

I was walkin' down the street about three o'clock
When I saw another MC at the end of the block
Talkin' to kids tellin' em, how they had to get the dough
So I rolled right up in the Cypher and said ""Yo!""
Here is an example of a whack MC
Caught in the world and he just can't see
He said, ""What? Aiyyo, you disrespectin' me?
Now I got to battle you and show them who the best be""
He started spittin', he said, ""Somethin' somethin' hot""
Then he tried to talk about the money that he got
I said, ""Shhh c'mon yo, that's all passé
I got to break it down another way like this now
Follow me here in this moment and time
Follow the rhyme created instigated to see the crime
You commit, when you sit in the past Don't you know?
You construct a future based on everything that you know
But to get to the unknown, we surely must erase
All the preconceived notions they keep throwin' up in our face
On the daily I run over tracks like Donovan Bailey
And break every record, in less than ten seconds""
They said, ""Oooooh! That's a real metaphysical
We pull down the light cause the force is centrifugal""
He tried to act up I had to give in
Because the truth is an offense and not a sin, word life

[Chorus:]

MC's ain't comin' equipped, with the rhyme
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is essential when you play with the lives of the youth
They want the truth, but you want loot
So ya change a little bit switch up your steeds
Now you got a bigger bag and countin' extra ki's
Please, everything you do we do with these
Real MC's are universal entities, that
Scope the universe lookin' for the fraudulence
Then we take a disguise like Clark Kent
My manner would have quick to check a scanner
For a weak MC sinkin' a city like Atlantis
You can't stand this, missile placed and you vanish
I meditate delevitate the twelve planets
You cannot withstand the heavy verbal attack
I'm the lyrical master blaster yeah I can do that
I can also be your style, because I analyzed it
You used to rock, but now you paralyzed it
Doesn't really matter like platinum blondes
Think what is an MC if he can't drop bombs
Don't really matter if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectin' is to wake up the dead
So pay attention it's the hard to behold
That everything that good it ain't gold, for real

But now I sit and chill with the pen and the pad
Dropping ill philosophical science
Me and my dad we talk about life
And how it started
How we departed from lights path
And probable right math
The task at hand is making people understand that we're not who we think we are
Within this land of lost the cost of souls could be so high
People be getting high wondering why we die
But it's all planned
To get your fear take the hand
We keep on returning because the lessons need learning
Concerning the fact
I sing and I rap
I hold this mic contact

Trying to rock

The time is at hand
In the year two zero one one
The people of the sun return to free the righteous children
Now!, I know you want to be on top of the world
Giving a diamond and pearl to your girl watching your jacuzi swirl
Seems like material lust
We need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust
Me!, it's kinda hard when you rhyme sometimes
Everybody wants to scrutinize
Redefine who you are
But every person is a star
So let your light shine far
And praise God

In this venture, nothing gained
I've only just touched the surface
Once nervous, when writing for a worthless purpose
It was once more than this, before the heart left the beat
The soul left the speech, I'm still trying to reach
My niche, and teach the love again
Inside the hate of a present day
Got stepped after, being genuine we're swept away
Before the importance of diamonds, bells
And a platinum place, fallen from grace
Not my campus with another trace
Of the same thing I came in, this thing is worth saving
Standing in the pockets holding tongues of what I'm saying
Blaming myself only for supporting what they're playing
I may peek through the storm, but now it's raining
Unchanging of late, it's hard to be creative
Although creating is native to me, I tried to be
Even patience couldn't save it, from the days of pages
They couldn't believe I would say this
No longer without wings, Kamau is what my name is
Too many undermine, what I underline
Placing my poetry underneath their making of rhymes
It was a creation of frustration
Brown bricks or blank slates
Subway trains and cardboard bound with masking tape
It was the sound of the evening, the way the day grew late
Words tumble from lungs over my tongue
And gave a new taste to my fate
It doesn't even matter how the chatter would paint us
With love on our side they could barely stand against us
Um, what up? Uh Kheaven, what's goin' down?
Um I got your message, and uh yeah, basically call me back

Can I write the songs to make the world sing
She's slim, with a rude gal demeanor
Happy to meet ch'ya miss argentina vibe-dobaleaner
Picking my crown, to hold me down
I took it back, now he's crying the tears of the clown
I slayed goliath with the mic in my hand
But I still make'em jam on american band stand
A fool proof plan, but is it calculated
Can't be violated or even be imitated
It's highly anticipated like spaceships interfering
And if it's not true it's nice to believe
In a return of original man, to slay the beef of the land

Matters mistaken, cause who we are is not physical
Bury mystical with the mind non typical
But, they want the cash flow
They steady scheming for the number one spot
These emcees they won't last though

From the third the star and telling us who we are

Now I just want to get back to me
Awe baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Things that I said I wouldn't do, I did 'em
Secrets below the service of truth I hid 'em
This mankind is past, but can he erase
The tears of a million years is human race
Of animals, that taught to walk upright
Then slave all day and fall in a trance at night
Flowing the planet, trying to find missing links
Like the men we used to be and always suppose to think
Mysteries, maybe not
It's getting hot, we better configure the plot, but
I hold a pen with the grip so tight
That' a squeeze the ink out'ta the page, and write a song for the people
Came up from the underground, now I write above on a hovercraft sound
This microphone, like an an amphetamine
Keeping me clean, speaking in dreams
So nature can intervene, just for a scene

Lost some friends along the way, I did dirt

Had been across the universe and inside of flowers
But what is it worth, I'm still just a man on the earth

Can I be candid, I can't stand it
Rap bandit, got Kheaven acting frantic
I want to swing my sword decapitate
But what is a man if he acts like an ape
So I sit back, planning my great escape
Load up my EPS and peruse my record crate
The man I used to be, I can only see by looking beyond me
So what is reality, I don't know

So I kept on walking
Pretended I didn't see
Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pile on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pile has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be seen

With southern twang claiming to be from Georgia
But I couldn't believe she had to be from galaxies
Far beyond and Kevin was so fond
Of the shape of her hands
I studied the lines in her face
Wondering if she knew what's the secret of human race is
Face it
I drop the Megatron Bomb
Thanks to Terry and Jackie I just stay calm
I got my heart broke one shot gun blow
But that's ok; I got a new name now

I got a new name; get up on this x8

Yo!
Dance to the x8

I can't take this feeling in my heart anymore
Time for me to step and make my way through the door
If by chance I see you on this road once again
I can guaranty you that I will not pretend

Don't rush, take it easy, slow down
The Earth is a space ship spinning round and round
We're in it, together, we can make it better
Don't sweat a thing, swing with no vendetta

To move every be	-boy king like Coretta Scott
Keep it hot block, once rock
The plot that we tried to recognize was not
The l to the o-v, m-o-v-e
K dub dropping the dub, that's new TV
The eMC double E, no doubt
Runnin' the route, wiggin' out, turnin' the part out
We all fall from grace and make mistakes
And raise to face to face with the antidote bass
And every single word in the verb. Wild style
This is not a mission. It's a written lifestyle
I'm still in the struggle and I see the light dial
Turnin' to 10. Ascend what's in the profile. 

Can you feel it, to the beat ya'll
Let the music play for the people
And if you're down to rock, whether you're ready or not
Yo, guess who?s back with the sequel

Oh yeah! Just do it

Now, in the beginning the light that shined so bright
Within the city of my mindscape night
Listening, glistening the moon reflecting the sun
Making me one with the music.
Oh, get low, get bold, get hold
Just look for black gold
Yes I'm in the house but I never ever sold
Rhyme black vinyl, 20 years old
With the mic in my hand, ringin' alarm
Singin' the song, bringing the calm to dramas so hard
To much info, been so instrumental, potential, exponential
My DJ's cuts are presidential
Yo Jazz, let the rhythm hit 'em
I woke up to make the main cut, to face the pain
What does space contain? Love
It's the heat-seeker, packin' the speaker to beat the sleep preacher
It was written: the sequel

Can you feel it, to the beat ya'll

And if you're down to rock, whether you're ready or not
Yo, guess who's back with the sequel

This is a broadcast from the universe 
Supersonic bionic, metaphor, megahertz 
I'm on a mission with the mic in the holster 
Spread the love from coast to coast 
Hereâ??s the dose of editing:
My only enemy's inside of me 
Trying a lot of me but my degree's in the anatomy 
Of thoughts as they rotate, like planets round the sun 
I observe them one by one, like a scientist 
Once again kids we be breaking the rules 
Taking the school, the MC's playing the fool 
What do you do, when all eyes are looking at you 
For the answers to impossible questions that ain't true 
That when I fall back 
Recognize magnetic attraction pulling light down to this physical fraction 
Makes me human, that why I humanize 
I came to make it break and make it equalize 

There's no need to run, staring at the sun 
There's one place left to go and everybody knows 
Things are going to change. There's only better days coming.

I'm back from sabbatical, this mathematical magical stealth with the microphone 
Seeing knowledge as self 
Itâ??s here to elevate, regulate, or discombobulate 
The weight of illegitimate fate now. 
Whatever the time, remember the mind's not the body 
It's probably my last time but maybe not 'cause I've 
Got a new style, it's what's up 
Pain of the people means pop don't stop 
Ladies and gents this is schoolhouse rock 
Changing the plot, hip-hop with me or not? 
Ripping apart, its stereotypical art 
Holding me back 'cause rap's not afraid of the dark 
Jimi Hendrix was a hero to most 
That's why we crown and toast the brand new host 
All the unknowns, they were heroes to most 
That's why we crown and toast the brand new host, equalize 

There's no need to run, staring at the sun 
There's one place left to go and everybody knows 
Things are going to change. There's only better days coming.

Gimme a beat

There's one place left to go and everybody knows 
Things are going to change. There's only better days coming.

Self-loathing?

Pesky flies getting you down?

Do it again, can he do it again?
Do it again, do it again

Ya, you see everyday
All the people standing at the train station
Left, right, left, right, left, right
We don't talk to each other now
What an alien nation
Up, tight, up, tight, up, tight
I hope one day some things can get better
I hope some way our hearts can change the weather

Plus I've got the power of the cat, rotate
I'm, straight digging in my record crate
Lights in your party so they leave the hate
Time is a thief that leaves nothing behind
And I've got no grief or acts to fry in this fair city

Who wants to know the plans, tell me the plans, tell me the plans

Levitate to the ceiling by resurrecting the feeling

Are we lost in the dark? I think we maybe forgot?
But never mind that, we like to party
We don't start trouble and we don't bother nobody
Cause Y is a letter with a long long tail
And I write these lyrics you can feel like braille

My antimatter is shattering any ladder that's crawling with snakes

I was down to my very last song
Didn't even know which way to go
Couldn't believe that this was happening
I said, ""God please don't put me back""
I didn't even see there was blood on my tracks
I was still compromising

And then the rain came and the sun went down below
And the city arose from the water it was all for show
And I realized what was happening
I had to pay the toll
It's true that you lose your mind when you can't control

But I was a fool to think I could play this game with you
Cause I was born to walk this higher road forever
There's no understanding all the things that people do
Cause when this higher road comes down, we'll be born together
Said when this higher road comes down, we'll be both forever

Yeah I was down to my very last friend
I was on highway Kevin again
Tell me why it's so hard to stay
In your place in the arms of who you want
Seems I got too close to the sun
I was burning burning burning burning

And then the rain came and the sun went down below
And the city arose from the water and the water flowed
And I realized what was happening
You have to pay the toll
True that you gain your soul
When you lose control

Fool to think that I could play this game with you

See there's no understanding all the things that people do

With glowing skeleton bones

In the closet, animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat between us
But you need a woman's glorious style on diamond to fetus
Carry my penis, I'm like the man in the moon
When we kissed then you soon on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me",I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman
k-os,"I live inside your head just like the day before tomorrow
And spending most our lives recalling things we already know
I tried so hard to steal the sky and call it heaven bound
At times I feel like I'm alone like a new kid in town
She said I need your love that's what she said
She said she had to break the mirrors that exist in her head
I often wonder if I could keep you gone from minds and things
But then I feel the heat and wind beneath these angel wings

Nice to know ya
Can't believe it's almost over now and you just wanna let me go
Nice to know ya
And when I look up at your picture I see somebody I ain't seen before
Nice to know ya

Nice to know ya
Even though you don't deserve me cause you would rather close the door
Nice to know ya

I'd rather run then work this out
You left the sun cause you burned it out
Ain't no time to waste
I already had my taste I gotta find another way
You and I go in and forever out of place because I'm leaving you today
Ooh never change always be the same driving slow on purpose up in my fast lane
Then again I think you reason with the heaven perception is reality perceived that I be leaving
I know the reason you need something to believe in
God she's the type to kick a sleeping dog
Raw when I eat the beef like a freak I'ma turning the other cheek

I don't wanna be the one to tell you it's over
I'm wise enough to see the sun I'm finally sober
I'm moving on you can't prove me wrong girl
There's nothing left to say cause I'm gone

And if the sun falls out the sky
And all the truth you know, turn lies
Up to you, but there's nothing to say (to say)

You know every word by heart

It's just so hard to get out of bed

Hard to believe how we left this ride
Used to believe in the man in the sky

Sin que hechada asi en la hierba
Quiero amarte paso a paso
Recorrerte como hiedra

No te salgas de mis brazos
Que hoy mis brazos son cadenas
Porque quiero que mis manos
Hoy de ti se queden llenas

Cuando el sol se este ocultando
Y en tus ojos brillen las estrellas
Y en mi espalda sienta el frio
De la oscura noche que se acerca
Yo te soltare despacio

De mis brazos ya sin fuerza
Te sacudiras el pelo
Para que jamas nadie lo sepa
Nos iremos con el alma y con el cuerpo
Con holor a hierba

Quiero que nos confundamos
Con el campo y con la tierra
Como espiga y como arbol
Como rama y hoja seca

Cuando el sol se este ocultando
Y en tus ojos brillen las estrellas
Y en mi espalda sienta el frio
De la oscura noche que se acerca

Se oía el canto de los gallos
Iban a ser dos jornadas
A lomo de sus caballos

La fiesta se celebraba
En el rancho del pitayo
Su padre les dio un consejo

Cuando a partir se aprestan
Cuiden muy bien el pellejo
Porque la vida se acaba
En las palabras del viejo

Los tres hermanos pensaban
Pedro le dice a Fabián
Dale un trago a José Luis
Que beba de ese mezcal

Pa' que se sienta feliz
Que ahorita nomas llegar
Nos vamos a divertir
Cuando arribaron al baile

A bailar se dirigieron
La muerte andaba en el aire
Ellos no la presintieron
Como les dijo su padre

Cuando del rancho salieron
Eran muchos los rivales
Viejos rencores surgieron
Rondando tras los jacales

Abrieron todo el fuego
Así matan los cobardes
Cuando los acosa el miedo
Un viejito solitario

Sin esperanza ninguna
Cuida el rancho y tres caballos
Como toda su fortuna
Va al panteón de vez en cuando
A visitar las tres tumbas

A venderlos a la capital
Cinco pesos será el menor precio

Que si son pajarillos silvestres
Les dirás que su tierra no es esa
Que los traes desde tierra caliente

Por que llorar el amor es así como viene se marcha
No hay solución solo queda el recuerdo y alguna canción
Por que llorar el amor es así como se viene se marcha
Pronto veras que lo que te a pasado se habrá de olvidar

K-Paz de la Sierra,"Acompaño a mi sombra por la avenida
Mis pasos se pierden entre tanta gente
Busco una puerta, una salida
Donde convivan pasados y presentes

De pronto me paro, alguien me observa
Levanto la vista y me encuentro con ella

Oí, no más
K-Paz de La Sierra

Una mañana fría llegó Carlos III con aire Encima
Se quitó el sombrero muy lentamente
Bajó de su caballo con voz profunda
Le dijo a su lacayo

Y ahí está La Puerta De Alcalá
Ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

Lanceros con casaca, monarcas de otras tierras
Fanfarrones que llegan inventando la guerra
Ilusos que resisten bajo el, ""No pasarán""
El sueño eterno como viene se va

Ahí está
La Puerta de Alcalá
Y ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

Todos los tiranos se abrazan como hermanos
Exhibiendo a las gentes sus calvas indecentes
Manadas de mangantes, doscientos estudiantes
Inician la revuelta son los años sesenta

Ahí está
La Puerta de Alcalá
Y ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

Un travestí perdido, un guardia pendenciero
Pelos colorados, chinchetas en los cueros
Rockeros insurgentes, modernos complacientes
Poetas y colgados, aires de libertad

Y ahí está
La Puerta de Alcalá
Y ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

La miro de frente y me pierdo en sus ojos
Sus arcos me vigilan, su sombra me acompaña
No intento esconderme, nadie la engaña
Toda la vida pasa por su mirada

Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala
La Puerta de Alcalá
Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala
La Puerta de Alcalá

Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala
La Puerta de Alcalá
Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala

Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala

Tu nombre,tu nombre
Y comienzo a sentir la nostalgia en mi ser, 
Sin poder evitar un lamento de amor, sin fin.

Oh, oh, y aquí estoy, esperando por ti,
Sin poder entender que me hizo alejarte de mi
Y aquí estoy, 
Quiero ver si por fin te decides volver 
Y creer que es posible empezar, una vez mas.

Hoy he vuelto a sentir el deseo de hablar y decir, que te amo
Que no puedo olvidar, esos días de ayer, que hay momentos
Que ya, no me puedo calmar, sin ti.

Oh, oh y aquí estoy, esperando por ti, sin poder entender
Que te hizo alejarte de mi

y no te detendré, haz lo que tu quieras
sin embargo recuerda que yo estaré aquí
en el mismo lugar y si solo tienes ganas de hablar
con gusto escuchare.

y si el supo darte mas amor
supo llenarte mas que yo
claro que se perder
claro que se perder

no tienes porque disimular
esas lagrimas están de mas
si tienes que irte vete ya.

Sin embargo esperaba
que te quedaras pero
el agua hay que dejarla correr
mientras yo me tragaba palabras
que no pude decir.

y si el viento hoy sopla a tu favor
yo no te guardare rencor.

claro que se perder
no sera la primera vez

seré un buen perdedor

K-Rino,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most
(Your heart's beatin')
And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

K. Flay,"We met on a Wednesday
In the summer, it was blazing
You looked at my black jeans, said are you crazy?
I guess I might have laughed
And after that you stuck to me like glue
But you had a girl at home and too many tattoos
I was in a rough patch, real depressed
You took my hand and said the sun it rises in the east but I came from the west
My heart it skipped and that was that
I should have known, don’t trust a poet
'Cause they can’t do the math

I’m always in the wrong place at the wrong time
Headed on a bad trip with the wrong high
I don’t really know why
But you felt right to me
I hadn’t had a good thing in a long time
Moving in the fast lane with the wrong guy
I don’t really know why
But you felt right to me

We met on a Friday
In the winter, it was freezing
Felt a bit like history repeating
We’d been on a break but then decided 
We could try to spend the night like friends and roam the city
Knowing what that meant
So we were back and I was pouring poison
Texting you reports from everywhere I went
And you’d write back ""I miss you even more""
And it was torture for me
I should have known, don’t trust a poet
'Cause they prefer to bleed

I hadn’t had a good thing in a long time
Moving in the fast lane with the wrong guy
I don’t really know why
But you felt right to me

Wrote this on a Sunday after months out on the road
Wonder if you have regrets and which direction those thoughts go
Like was it worth it in the end?
Sometimes it feels like you just used me for my mind and innocence
And now I heard you had a kid, finished a book and got a wife
Things been good to you since that last goodbye
But I just have to say my piece
You should have known don’t trust a poet
'Cause we know how to speak

I’m always in the wrong place at the wrong time

In my two hands, saying no thanks
Like any way it goes 'cause I know things

Hanging by a sentence at the drug store
Barely even steady out the front door
Hate my own shit, but I love yours
Fuck, I really love yours

Seven in the afternoon, half asleep, count the cars
All I think about is you constantly, that's the hard part
Static on the line, I hear it all the time

But I'm brighter when you make me fade

Shaking from my temple to my ankles

Nah, I've been messing with the right shit

Make a girl wanna get stupid and violent
But silently I've been eyeing the horizon
Patterns repeat, it shouldn't be surprising, oh

Missing cash, blacking out, heartless in a few ways

Please calm the fuck down, I'll do whatever you say
I get it, I get it, I'm living too hard and it's time that I stop it

Bar tabs on a hot night in a cold basement
You say I'm crazy but I feel amazing

Fell down on Bedford, hope that it's not broken
Safe to say I might have had too much of some of these potions
I love you so much, I'm staying here all night
Don't want to get up, I don't want to stop, I don't want to close my eyes
I'd rather not give a fuck and end up with some scars
The night's just long enough for me to build it all and let it fall apart

K. Flay,"In December I was cold
I felt like I got swallowed by the trees
January, I was filled with hope
But nothing changed at all, especially me, oh

Lately I’ve been afraid of myself
Tried some pills but they didn’t help
Who can tell anymore how you’re supposed to be you
Really anything’s true, really anything’s gold
If you paint it that way
I’m needing a statement to make so I wrote out my life as a list
Thinking ""is this shit all there is?""

In February I was out of luck
Cupid couldn’t find my home address
August brought a tender kind of touch
But lust, it soon enough turned to regret

Stupid, I’ve been abusing my mind
Number than ever, I’m losing the time
And all that I want is to do what’s impossible
Heard you got rushed to the hospital
I called but the static was so loud
Now I’m tracing the streets of our hometown
You never know what you’ll miss
Till the moment that you’re leaving it

It’s been a slow, slow march
Waiting for a reason to move
It’s been a slow, slow start
But I’m hoping that I’ll make it to June
It’s been a slow, slow march
Waiting for the flowers to bloom
It’s been a slow, slow start
But I know I could be somebody new, s-s-s-somebody new
S-s-s-somebody new
S-s-s-somebody new
S-s-s-somebody new
S-s-s, s-s-s

K. Flay,"Champagne in the kitchen not because I bought it but because
I'm crashing an apartment and somebody left it open
So I poured it in a cup, drank it up
I got the devil in my head but angels swimming in my blood
Plus the conscience of my dead dad
Plus my living mama plus my other father who raised me not to be sad
And my brother who says that he worries about me from my songs
And my sister who's been living like a saint for so damn long
Well I've been fucking sinning til the lights come up 
And the mics catch us saying shit that we never really meant
Crew wears all black stuff but we all act like we're so different
But everybody bleeds, right?
Everybody's waiting for the phone to ring
Yeah everybody seems fine
But everybody's got pieces missing
At minimum I'd like a little medicine to make me feel like everything
Diminishing the venom that been harshing all my mellows 
I'm continuing to fight against the sentiment that make me want to die
In a world full of uptight gentlemen 
I wanna find a boy smelling like sweet cinnamon 
To quote some Tennyson while we take Benadryl 
To make my head a bit extra light

I feel it, I want it
I need it, I love it
I'm looking for something
To make me feel nothing
I feel it, I want it
I need it, I love it
I'm looking for something
To make me feel nothing

Driving through the bay, pray for understanding
I'll be silent for a day, wait until I vanish 
And I'm fighting for a break, vacant kind of passion
Never really can account for all the ways in which I've acted
Tried to call my daddy but he's been gone a decade 
So I'm drinking like an addict til I'm fucking with a headache
Happiness sporadic so I'm crying on a Wednesday
Not trying to be combative but I'm dealing with some dead weight
Verbalize the hurt inside make me wanna burn alive
My heart was never broken, it was circumcised",Champagne

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far

Leaving niggas with holes in their heads unconscience 

No second chances 

'cause in this game no one advances 

You made your move and fucked up now the devil dances 

No scrilla for this just murderers with blocks 

To run up on their dick and hit em and get em hot 

With a 357 slug pointed at your nose 

Left a bloody mess and a note stuck between your toes 

You fuck with me nigga you're fucking with the warrior 

Anybody destroying you're packing the sig sauer 

Putting niggas off in body bags 'cause in this game you take no prisoners 

Leave it in blood Hare Krishna 

Nobody's breathing niggas stuck on getting even 

You die this evening insanity gon be my reason

With this vivid imagination and slugs that kill 

Off in the zone unorthodox with the world on blocks 

It's unexplainable how I got these bitch niggas locked 

Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour 

Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour 

Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge 

I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard 

It's too cold to proceed without a block to start 

Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart 

Now who the fuck am I? Is the question you ask 

Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know 

It's 1998 plus you bitches got to go 

And y'all cain't fuck with me and tell em why 

My adrenaline rush on jump 

Plus you got my arm beneath grabbing with the double barrel pump

I never seen a thousand soldiers hit the dirt on your roll 

Fuck your chief and all the soldiers I'm a king on my own 

I'm coming with force down with Big Chief nigga Rapalot style 

Grip sixteens and triple beams will leave that ass on the pile 

Walk on down and see the light 'cause I'm not faking the shit 

I told you once that I'm a soldier I'm just taking your shit 

Now who am I a born killer nigga fuck what you heard

And leave they brains fucked up 

I don't know why they put they eyes on me 

'cause I'm a black material killer trying to keep it low key 

Now what it was they probably didn't know it was me 

But that goes to show em that fancy bitches focus just be 

They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat 

They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets

I can't wait to see you later on a scene
And we can get deep in too

I just wanna walk with you, talk with you
Better care not, sparks with you
Anything you wanna do
Said it always, it's all for you
Wanna get to know ya,
Think of places I can show ya
All the things you've ever seen in your dreams

We can roll we can chill,
Ride at 5, if you're tired
We can vibe, all night
Tell you you're mine, you tell me yours
If we get bored, you lock the door
I don't need, none of my people they all can leave.

Now it's you and me, and me and you
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love, and all the times
So happy together

And you say you'll be home with me and ease my mind,
Imagine how the world would be, so very fine,

Take you trips out across the globe
Paris dinners have romantic dinners
Keep room for desert when the food is finished
Time to break you off, like the roots in music
Pick you which chick that I choose to move with
So if you would tell me who you crew with
I tell you who you are
If they can rap if whether you just with me for the car
If the day when a man drives
Is what drives a man and for it the man dies
For the things he believes in,
If so when he dies it'll assume the he's leaving
Believe me I'm keeping you satisfied
Put the drama aside and just ride,
We could do the darkest weather
Get rich, stacking the cheddar who would keep the blunt licked,
Give me respect and I bet we'll be happy together

Let me know what the deal,
We can roll we can chill,

The dreams that we planned
Would only end in shadowland

Why you had to go
Whatever blunder I mad
I don't know
I guess that something
Turned out wrong
Didn't quite belong

I'm a shadow, but you know
I'm the one who loves you so
So please, take my hand
And lead me out of shadowland

Bist neidisch weil ich deine Alte mit'm Nudelholz jag
Was würden wir tun wenn wir diese Fans nicht hätten
Die das dritte Album kaufen auf dem wir ausschließlich über Schwänze rappen
Wir wollen Liebe und Scheine
K.I.Z. ist Untergrund dann schließ dich in dei'm Keller ein
Und denk du hast uns für dich alleine

Setze mich, setze mich an den Computer und check mein she-males

Rappt ruhig über Waffen und Geld, doch es geht nur noch um Punchlines und Steaks
Schwänze draußen bis zur letzten Melodie

All diese Rapper sind Schlangen, sie nehmen die Eier in' Hals
Ich komm nicht mit vor die Tür, wir gehen gleich in den Wald
Das ist freie Gewalt, ich kämpfe für rohe Liebe
Zum Glück für dich ist der Rest meiner Leute im Zoo geblieben
Ich guck nicht länger zu, während der Rest von euch abkassiert

Dein Papa mein neuer Geldgeber, meiner sieht aus wie der Hellraiser
Ich hole dich ab wie ein Feldjäger, Gott ist ein Schiri und gab mir elf Meter
Denn ich bin ein Pimp, auf meinem Sack ein Pentagramm
Nenn' mich den Sex Terroristen, denn ich spreng' dein Darm

Mit 4-Sack-Antrieb du brauchst Street-Credibility und lässt dir Kugeln implantieren
Du hast Fans ich Jünger die vor deinem Studio explodieren
Du heulst 'rum wenn einer Nutte oder Hurensohn sagt
Bist neidisch weil ich deine Alte mit'm Nudelholz jag
Was würden wir tun wenn wir diese Fans nicht hätten
Die das dritte Album kaufen auf dem wir ausschließlich über Schwänze rappen
Wir wollen Liebe und Scheine
K.I.Z. ist Untergrund dann schließ dich in dei'm Keller ein
Und denk du hast uns für dich alleine
Frauen rufen an, ich lege auf wie mein DJ
Setze mich, setze mich an den Computer und check mein she-males
Rockstars bloß ohne Klampfe und H
Rappt ruhig über Waffen und Geld, doch es geht nur noch um Punchlines und Steaks
Schwänze draußen bis zur letzten Melodie
Man sagt die guten sterben jung, doch die besten sterben nie

Wir haben das Land gefickt
Stehen auf der Bühne mit leerem Bauch und der Hand im Schritt
(Ich habe euer Maul gestopft aber meins noch nicht!
Euer Maul gestopft meins noch nicht!)
Was bringt uns der Respekt wenn wir nix verdienen
Wir haben ausgestopfte Rapper über unser'm Kamin
(Ich habe Hunger, ich habe Hunger!
Ich will Geld essen, Geld essen!)

Diese Mordattentate sind eine Heuschreckenplage
Kugeln treffen mich nicht weil ich 70 Goldketten trage
Nach der Autobombe setz ich mich wieder zusammen
Um ins Studio zu kommen nehm ich heut lieber die Tram
Ich bin unbeliebt, seitdem ich beim Bunker unterschrieb
Mach ich menschenverachtende Untergrundmusik
Mir ist Scheißegal, ob sich dieser Mist verkauft
Rapper flüchten auf Klo, kacken ihr Rückgrat aus
Strippoker um dein Leben, mit deiner Frau im Garten
Ich nehme sie von hinten und schau ihr in die Karten
Sie sagt sie würd' sich vor dei'm Fischstäbchen ekeln
Deine Oma möchte mir ein Strick für dich häkeln
Deine Mama wird gebumst bis sich dein Vater verfärbt
Siebzig Männer in ihr drin, ein trojanisches Pferd
Opfer bring mir ein Drink, sei ein nützliches Kind
Deutscher Rap weckt meinen Beschützerinstinkt

Frag mich wie dein Album ist (So lala!)
Das ist meine letzte Nacht, Licht auf mich, ich hol' den Sack raus
Früher gab's für sowas Ritalin, heute Applaus
Du musst es echt halten, trag nur noch Kleider und schmink dich
Das Licht im Bunker macht meine Haut blass und ich bräune mich im Blitzlicht
All diese Rapper sind Schlangen, sie nehmen die Eier in' Hals
Ich komm nicht mit vor die Tür, wir gehen gleich in den Wald
Das ist freie Gewalt, ich kämpfe für rohe Liebe
Zum Glück für dich ist der Rest meiner Leute im Zoo geblieben
Ich guck nicht länger zu, während der Rest von euch abkassiert
Als ich klein war, habe ich auf Catwoman masturbiert
Wir sind 'ne Boygroup, der Bunker ist nur Tarnung
Groupies werden ohnmächtig, ich mache Arsch-zu-Mund-Beatmung

Ich springe nackt auf die Theke sie hat 'nen Kurzen bestellt
Ich such die Nadel im Heuhaufen bin zu behaart
Und schlecht bestückt wie ein ostdeutscher Supermarkt
Ich sammle Treueherzen auf der Reeperbahn
Doch mein Pimmel will nicht groß werden wie Peter Pan
Keine Frauen die mich verfolgen und ich wichs mir ein'
Ich hab 99 Probleme aber die Bitch is' keins

Du hast für mich gekocht und ich bin dein Zahnstocher

Wenn ich was in der Hose haben will dann kack ich mir ein'

Mein Schwanz ist so klein er reicht nicht bis rein
Ich versuche deine Frau zu vergewaltigen und sie schläft ein
Alleingelassen mach ich ein Gesicht wie beim Kacken

Ich lieg unter der Decke, onanier mit der Pinzette
Und verliere das Interesse
Ich bin ein Exhibitionist – die Fußgängerzone ist tot
Los Schlampe, guck durch das Elektronenmikroskop
Sie nennt mich einen Schlaffi und sagt „Pack ihn wieder ein!
Egal, dafür ist wenigstens mein Herz aus Stein
Ich ficke bis zum Leistenbruch
Und spritzte dir in dein Gesicht voll mit heißer Luft

Es geht mir gut ich fühl mich als würd ich ihn baumeln lassen
Aber geht ja nicht er ist so klein ich krieg ihn kaum zu fassen
Ich krieg jede frau zum lachen, ich brauch ihn nur auszupacken
Einfach draußenlassen, wenn sie lacht scheints ihr nix auszumachen
Sie schreit trotzdem vor schmerz wenn ich ihn reinstecke
Es tut ihr weh sie sagt es piekst sie wie ne reißzwecke
Ich hab mehr spaß an meinem Schwanz als diese gut betuchten
Ich kann wie Sherlock Holmes mein' Pimmel mit der Lupe suchen
Er ist so winzig und bringts nicht
Was auch immer da grad drin ist ich bins nicht
Immer wenn ich nackt über die Straße renn
Schrein sie „da kommt Ken!“
Und dann sag ich Ihnen

Ich wollte sie schänden
Ich beichte im Gerichtssaal unter Tränen
Sie sollte blasen er reichte nichtmal bis zu den Zähnen
Werd ich dieses Jahr mit einer Penispumpe belohnt?
Der Weihnachtsmann lacht sich über meinen Wunschzettel tot
Nach der Hochzeitsnacht kein Blut auf dem Bettlaken
Dein Jungfernhäutchen intakt, obwohl wir Sex hatten
Mit ""Riesenglied"" ham' wir euch nur verarscht
Ich starre voller Penisneid in das Gurkenglas
Binde mein' Schwanz mit 'nem Faden an der Türklinke fest
Knall die Tür zu in der Hoffnung, dass er irgendwann wächst
Und du kannst mich nicht schocken mit deim' Tritt in die Nüsse
Wenn ich wichse sieht es aus als ob ich Pickel ausdrücke

Alles, was für dich dabei raussprang, war deine Mutter aus der Torte
Dein Album klingt so beschissen, hab' ich ein Kind totgebissen?
Oder warum versuchst du mich einzuschläfern?
Gib mir den ersten Stein, denn ich bin frei von Fehlern

An deiner Karre härt' ich mir die Schienbeine ab

Es dreht sich alles immer nur um mein Sperma
Ich bin am Mutterficken und dein Vater macht'n Schnappschuss

Ich geh' bei dem Namen von Nico K.I.Z
Und ich hab, was es braucht, dich zu kriegen ins Bett
Der Typ mit dem schwarzen Balken vorm Gesicht
In der Bildzeitung bin jedesmal ich
Nazis aufs Maul, da wird nie diskutiert
Denn ich hab' nie gelernt mich artizukulieren
Ich hab' was für die Junkies am Kottbusser Tor
Und sie rennen die Treppen rauf wie Rocky Balboa
John Wayne Style, ich schieße aus der Hüfte
Du Spast, nicht mal deine Mutter ließ dich an die Brüste
Und die lässt eigentlich jeden an die Brüste
Als Tarek sagte, dass wir jetzt zu Universal gehören
Habe ich das erste Mal von Universal gehört
Ein Verse - Universal zerstört

Sitting at that table so all alone

I believe that we're two of a kind

Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts keep the pain on the run
When it's all night and the night's just begun
Don't you know two hearts, two hearts are better than one?

Honey, we don't have to face this all by our lonesome
All tied up by heartache, surrounded by blue
We found each other, don't you know the hardest part is over?
Now it's just a matter of following through

We can hold on as the night swirls around us
Sheltered in each other's arms
Oh and it could be better if we were together

It's a favorite of mine.
About a little girl and some sheep
That she could not find.
They told her not to worry,
They'd come back.
Darlin, you're my shepard,
I'm your little lamb.
But you ain't always gonna know where I am,
But don't you worry, I'll come back.

I'll always come back, come back baby, to you.
I'll always run back, straight to you.
I'll never get too far away from you.
I'll never get too lost that I can't be found.
And I'm never gonna swim too far out, I might drown.
And I'll always come back, come back baby, to you.

Well there's a wooden wonder from way down under,
They call a boomerang.
If you handle it right, it'll come back.
But, you must have had one when you were a boy.
'Cause you've got the touch that turns me into a toy.
And like a boomerang, I'll come back.

Keep your eyes on the horizon.
When you start to missing me,
Just look out your window and there I'll be.

'Cause I'll always come back, come back baby, to you.
I'll always run back, straight to you.
I'll never get too far away from you.
I'll never get too lost that I can't be found.

I was with another guy
Said it made you
Want to go home and cry
Well I know just how you feel
Well baby I caught you
But I never let you know that you'd been caught
But the straw that broke my camel's back
Was that blonde too stupid to talk
I swore I'd get even, even if it's the last thing I do
Now I'm just sitting here waiting for sweet revenge
You know somebody told me it's sweet as sweet has ever been
Well that somebody lied, honey all I do is cry
I evened it up the score but I went and lost the war
(Chorus:)
And now I'm truly blue since I don't have you
If I wrote my feelings down in a letter to you
I'd have to sign it yours truly blue
But now Miss Know-It-All
I'm sittin' here all alone
Yeah once in a while I pick up my phone
To see if the thing's still on
‘Cause it ain't ringing, ringing
I bet your phone is ringing off the wall
And honey oh how I miss you
And if you were here I'd kiss you
Baby but baby you're somebody else' baby now

I remember laughing my head off when I read that in a magazine
(I was twenty at the time)
Now I'm staring forty right in the face
And the only trouble with being a woman my age, is the men my age.

That's why younger men are starting to catch my eye
I'm starting to stop what I'm doing 
just to turn around and watch them walk by
At the very next opportunity
I'm gonna give a younger man a try
Because younger men are starting to catch my eye

Men my age, poor old darlings, they're worried and their harry
Some of them drink too much, whole lot of them are married
And honey here I'm at on the threshold of all that fun
I'm gonna try my best to cross it with a younger one

Oh, I said that younger men are starting to catch my eye

Why don't you pour it from a bottle instead of a tiny silver flask?
Drink you Scotch from a Gin where the drys can't get in.

That David played and it pleased the Lord

The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah","No Love, No Nothin'/You'll Never Know"
K.T. Sullivan,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow
K.T. Sullivan,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory

I tried to warn you somehow.

Now you must pay;

Stayed beneath my feet before.

Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

[Verse 1:]
In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets and walked up to this girl
He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And her looks, that a night he liked to twirl
And he says:
""I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oohhh give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?

[Verse 2:]
And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long long time ago
He fell in love, but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife
And he sings to her nightly, he says
""Lydia, oh Lydia, I wish I didn't get ridda ya
Lydia I miss your rose tatoo
There's some things I can't forget
Oh hunny why did I dis ya? (you can learn a lot from Lydia)

[Verse 3:]
Now take a cup and walk away
To this secret hideaway
And our lonely man is at a loss for words
She says ""How far do you want to go?""
He says ""How far is to Moreau?""
And when they make love, this is all that can be heard
Silence, and then you hear
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Aye aye aye aye aye, give me ecstacy
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Give me all those things i miss

Baby that's a what I like
(Hold me, squeeze me)
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
(Hold me, squeeze me)
Baby that's a what I like

In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets
And walked up to this girl

He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And her looks, that a night he liked to twirl
And he says

""I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oh, give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?
And we can move it like this""

Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like

And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long, long time ago
He fell in love but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife

And he sings to her nightly, he says
""Lydia, oh, Lydia, I wish I didn't get ridda ya
Lydia, I miss your rose tattoo
There's some things I can't forget
Oh, honey, why did I dis ya? You can learn a lot from Lydia
I gotta move it like this""

Baby that's a what I like
(Hold me, squeeze me)
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
(Hold me, squeeze me)
Baby that's a what I like

Now take a cup and walk away
To this secret hideaway
And our lonely man is at a loss for words
She says, ""How far do you want to go?""
He says, ""How far is to Moreau?""
And when they make love, this is all that can be heard

Silence, then you hear
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, make sweet love to me
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, give me ecstasy
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, make sweet love to me
Give me all those things I miss
But start it off with a kiss
And move a little something like this

And now ya move it like this
(Baby that's a what I like)
Start it off with a kiss
Then move a little something like this
(Baby that's a what I like)

And now ya move it like this
(Baby that's a what I like)
Start it off with a kiss, and now ya move it like

Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years
You're still the one I want whisperin' in my ear

You're still the one -- I want to talk to in bed
Still the one -- that turns my head
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow

You're still the one -- that makes me laugh
Still the one -- that's my better half
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one -- that makes me strong
Still the one -- I want to take along
We're still having fun, and you're still the one (yes you are)

Changing, our love is going gold
Even though we grow old, it grows new

You're still the one -- that I love to touch
Still the one -- and I can't get enough
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one -- who can scratch my itch
Still the one -- and I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You are still the one -- that makes me shout

Kaare Norge,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man
'We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!",Hotel California

Foudroyé par un déluge de plomb dans l'exercice de mes fonctions
Suffit du bruit, d'une liasse pour que la star se révèle
Le clac du string d'une tass pour que le char se réveille

Dès que ta seuf est moulée dans le Gucci
C'est pour faire couler notre coulis
Ouais il est vrai qu'à la base on a pas tous les mêmes sous
Mais à la fin quand y'a plus rien nos larmes ont toutes le même goût
Le crime a pris notre vie en otage des bleus dans les virages

Sur le banc des PC, vous m’excuserez que Adam ait péché
C’est mon clan, dépêchez vous d’me sucer j’ai le gland desséché
J'roule ma zer' en prenant soin de ce qui va arriver dans mon joint
Coup de boule à zer' c’est ce qui va arriver dans ton groin

Tuer mes ennemis mourir avec mes intententententions
Des litres de sang de mammifères coulent sur les mèches et les poupées
Pendant que celui des poulets sèche sous les roues du coupé
On avance avec l’anti-recul grâce au module
Du sable dans leurs rotules, nos larves dans leurs ovules

Les derniers qui ont cru on leur a cousu
J'ai balancé le jus elle a tout bu
Je les aime nues, rasées ou touffues
Je vais braquer leurs miches, il me faut un T-Max
Je les ouvre, pied-de-biche avec des Air Max

Sur la table couilles, sel et poivre moulu

Juste, pends-toi avec ta langue

A ti me quiero entregar
Soñar y cambiar de lugar
Donde te pueda yo mirar

Tómame, siénteme, tócame
Y dejaré que tú respires de mí

Juntos podemos empezar

Y da otra oportunidad
Porque sin ti yo no
Y llegar hasta tocar el mar

Unas hadas trabajando en un vestido azul

En un carruaje azul

Es su fuego enloquecido lo que da calor
Y la bruja su vecina, tarde y noche, un remedio buscará
Porque el fuego no lo calma ni el ventilador
Podría pasar mi vida con aquel gigante
Que todo el mundo teme

Me dice que es solo un ser humano

Creo que en un cuento de hadas me escribi

Drinking her memory away when he can
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore
Now they don't try anymore

How does it all come to happen
That's not what love is for and if I thought it was
I would leave you in the morning

Put me through to him
For I do believe I am running out of time

Kacey Jones,"Lord, his daddy was an honest man
A redwood Georgia farmer
His mama lived a short life
Having kids and bailing hay

He had fifteen years
And he ached inside to wander
He jumped afraid and weak cross
And wound up in a lake

Oh, the cold nights had no pity
On that way crossed Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry
And then the summer came

He met a girl know on the strip
At San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitution's child born of
An LA street called Shane

Growin' up came quietly
In the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found in mornings
It brought a meaning to his life

Lord, on the night before she left sleep Kane
And left that way crossed country boy
With dreams of Georgia cotton
And a California wife

Sunday morning found him standing in ease
The red light at her door
A right cross sent him reelin'
Put him face down on the floor

In place of his Mabel Joy he found
A merchant memory
Who ground your Georgia neckies red
But sunny, your still green

He turned twenty one
In a Gray Rock Federal Prison
The old judge had no mercy
On that way crossed Georgia boy

Staring at those four gray walls
In silence he would listen
To that midnight freight
He knew could take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning found him lying in ease
The red light at her door
With a bullet in his side
He cried, abusing Mabel Joy

Stunned and shaken, someone says
Son she's not here no more
She left this house four years today
They say she's lookin' for some Georgia farm boy

Oh, what will I do in the dead of the night?

And he comes to me, he comes to me
What will I do to the need in who subsides?

When the lights are red and low

So I close my eyes and I let my memory fly
To a time and place with you

Mamas hooked on Mary Kay
Brothers hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddies hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary,
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go,
Where it stops nobody knows,
And it ain't slowin' down, this merry go 'round

We think the first time's good enough,
So we hold on to high school love,
Say we won't end up like our parents

Tiny little boxes in a row,
Ain't want you want it's what you know,
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'

Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

Cause Mamas hooked on Mary Kay
Brothers hooked on Mary Jane
Daddies hooked on Mary two doors down

Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go
Where we stop nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down, this merry go 'round

Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round

Jack and Jill went up the hill,
Jack burned out on booze and pills,
And Mary had a little lamb,
Mary just don't give a damn no more",Merry Go 'Round

Put back, put me back

I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything

It's probably closer than I thought it could be
All this off the grid is getting old
And my compass says I'm getting close

When you can have one on four wheels
And take it anywhere the wind might blow

So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'

By the time we get there, everybody will be drunk
The chairs will be on tables and the band will be unplugged

But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

And the wolf at your door's always meaner

I'd fall down
And my mama cried
When she realized

I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I try to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

God bless the girls who smile and hug
When they're called out as a runner up on TV
I wish I could, but I just can't
Wear a smile when a smile ain't what I'm feelin'
And who's to say I'm a 9.5
Or a 4.0 if you don't even know me
Life ain't always roses and pantyhose
And

That keeps me coming back to you

You're irreplaceable but I'll replace you

Your eyes always follow me
You try to hold me

Try to own me
Keeping something that's not yours
You want to make me
Believe that I'm crazy
Make me think that you're the cure

It's unbelievable but I believed you
Unforgivable but I forgave you

In my sleep
You're all I see
But I can't go back

For us to go on
And I'm growing strong
To confront my fears

Unforgivable but I forgave you

That'd be nice

Crazy man's preachin' in the street in the mornin'
Sayin' white man's corrupted the world and Jesus ain't comin'
Seagulls are laughin' and I finish my coffee
In a little cafe on the corner of Rose and Dudley

The sand falls from my hand as I, I pick up my guitar
I lay out a blanket, kiss the sun as I sing words from my heart
You make your way to the place where I am and I'm like
""Hey, won't you come listen to me play?""

I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Ca-Ca-Cadillac Hotel
Spend the whole night under the stars singing to you
Until I melt in your lips, taste your sweet kiss of candy caramel
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel with you

The evening sun falls into the ocean over Malibu skies
And I can't help but drown in the blue of your emerald eyes
You smile and say, ""Hey baby, won't you come up to my room?""
But I'm like, ""Just come with me, I know a place with a better view""

I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Ca-Ca-Cadillac Hotel
Spend the whole night under the stars singing to you
Until I melt in your lips, taste your sweet kiss of candy caramel
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Cadillac Hotel

The moon lights your face in the dark of the night
I pull you in with my sweet lullaby
The city is sleeping, I'm melting inside
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I wanna see the sun rise, taste your lips, taste your lips
I wanna see the sun rise on the roof of the Ca-Ca-Cadillac Hotel
Spend the whole night under the stars singing to you
Until I melt in your lips, taste your sweet kiss of candy caramel

Kacy Crowley,"Across the river we all had dreams
They got caught up in little puddle upstreams
Melting down to the very cold
Just thank God there's always a little more

We moved to cities to separate
We end up smashed together anyways
And every color and every shape
We're all mixed up just like Lauren

Hate

And you can say that things that change
But in the mirror I 'ways look the same
In between high and low
Takes the few things that we know
Just to balance where to go

We stand on platforms and wait for trains
Some double doger will have worldly pains
We are never sure which one of us is moving now ahead

You can say that things that change
But in the mirror I always look the same
In between the high and low
Takes the few things that we know
Just to balance where to go

My eyes close with my place wide open
My breath it stops on a dime

I call my mother though we don't go along
Because when I was there she was cold and furious
One last thing I need to get a handle of
People can love you, still do you wrong

You can say that things that change
But in the mirror I always look the same
In between the high and low
Takes the few things that we know
Just to balance where to go

Baby, just to balance

Unmet, she comes back as a cat
A wise man once told me that reincarnation
Is common in cases like that

Like Sei Shonagon I was once a good lady
And you were my lover back when
Your Samurai relatives ruled Kamakura
I wish you'd had time for me then

You were too busy hunting, or watching the wrestling
Learning to fence andto ride
You left me with servants who made me look beautiful
Just in case you changed your mind

So don't be surprised, love, if one rainy evening
A meowing awakens your bed(?)
And cat that's a ghost that can visit the past
Comes pushing it's nose through your gate

Don't be afraid of a cat from the future
Somebody built a machine
Allowing the cat to go centuries back
Through an electronic catflap in time

Don't be afraid if I seem supernatural
One of us died long ago
I don't mean to scare you, I needn't stay
I just wanted to tell you hello

In the future the miceare wiped out by a virus
Pollution obscures the full moon
Human beings live in cages
They've built in the sky
The tea rooms and temples are gone

Cats are just guinea pigs
People are astronauts
Love is as cold as the snow
People shoot moon rockets into the past
It's the last unspoiled place left to go

You're world has perished
But sometimes I miss you
And come slinking back to the past
In search of affection the future can't give me
Because it's too cold and too fast

Down among the lilies, down among the lilies
Shooting with his Hasselblad beneath a willow tree

Where teenage girls like me can come and learn
Stay in bed till three o'clock and lounge about with nothing on
He only asks for photos in return

Member of the Royal Photography Society
Mr. David, really, don't you think it's silly
A tank of liquid nitrogen, a cloud of carbon snow
Just to gild the lily, just to gild the lily

Can bring erection to the lap
Of just one man, it hasn't been in vain

People who can stay in shape
Llook great
People who have style to spare
A and wear ironic flares

You signed your name and sold your soul
I guess you froze yourself, so cool you're truly cold

Originality, time for a little individuality

Change?
Why not try living a little closer to the edge for a

I know you know how true it can be...
But you're afraid of the need, 
Can't risk the imminent bleed,
What is love but the greatest of dangers...
And now the songs are a lie,
I never dreamed you would cry in a bed of a stranger...

Am I the last to know?

And in the shuddered rush, I will fall...
And in the tumbling I see it all...
A hushed release of you, and I'm free, and alive, and my heart, is the
Last...

Am I the Last to know?
",Last to Know
Kai,"Tonight we're all alone tonight 
There's never been a moment 
That trembled like tonight 
I read your eyes tonight 

I see a love I've always known from another time 
That once again is mine I need to know 
Are you real? 
Do you feel the way I feel? 

Could you love like I love you? 
Say you can and say you do 

Say you'll stay say you're sure 
Say my heart was made for yours 
Let our love lead the way 
Say you'll stay 

Tonight, I've waited for tonight 
I've waited all my life to be here where we are 
With you here in my arms 
I can't believe, how you shine 

Is this moment really mine? 
Could you love, like I love you? 
Say you can and say you do 

[Chorus]
Say you'll stay, by my side 
Say it's more than just tonight 
Say our love, would never let you walk away (never walk away) 
Say you'll stay, say you're sure 
Say my heart was made for yours 
Let our love, lead the way 
Say you'll stay (say you'll stay) 

Say you'll stay 
Forever in my arms

Girl, I'll kiss them all away 
So if you want to be my lady, say you'll stay

It's gonna fall 
There will be days 
When you'll wonder 
If you can keep holding on 
And as hard as you'll try 
There will be nights 
When you'll feel like 
You're gonna break down and cry 

Alone and in need 
If you say a prayer 
And reach out to me 

[Chorus]
I will be here 
Right by your side 
Count on my love 
Everyday of your life 
I will be here 
Pulling you through 
Count on me loving you 

Count on a dream 
Falling apart 
There will be times 
When you'll feel 
The whole world is 
Breaking your heart 

And when you're afraid 
If you close your eyes 
And call out my name

And through all the pain 
You can count on my love 
Every step of the way?

Was it the love I failed to show

The way back home can be so hard 
I know we'll make it if we're heart to heart 
And if we give love everyday 
I know we'll make it if we're heart to heart, to heart

Did I forget to show you that you are my everything

Leaving the world behind?

The sorrow, the pain and the fear
Of the unknown future

Delivering from any human needs and pressure
In just one second

Your cry for help is lost in this lonely world
In which you are completely alone

Nobody helps you when you're feeling down
And the loneliness is breaking your heart

It would be so simple to go down
The stairs of the final way

Of having nothing, of being nothing

And takes away your longing for self-destruction

Awaken from your paralyzing nightmare
And transcend the boundaries to reality
For caution to the wind be free
Unleash the strength within to dare

Express your hidden passion
Express your hidden passion

Express your hidden passion here and now
Dancing free, a soul without fear
No need to hide or be ashamed
Craps your chance release your passion now

The walls of inhibition crumble
Past shadows fade and light prevails
Like the phoenix from the ashes you have risen
Live life to the fullest while other stumble

While other stumble

Express your hidden passion

Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Te soy sincero me dolió partir
Pero en aquel momento
Hoy me arrepiento
No aposté por ti

Es normal equivocarse
Dar marcha atrás
Y estar dispuesto a recomenzar

Perdóname, quise vivir la vida
Y me deje llevar
Perdóname y una luz encendida
Me hizo regresar
Y pidiendo de rodillas
La miel de tu sonrisa

Casi nunca sabemos
Lo que tenemos
Y cuando el azar

En un cambio de juego
Medió el espejo de la realidad
Y que andaba buscando
Por todos lados alguien como tú
Dando palos de ciego

Buscando el norte
En pleno polo sur
No, podré recompensarte
Jamás podré
Pero te pido de corazón

Perdóname, quise vivir la vida
Y me deje llevar
Perdóname y una luz encendida
Me hizo regresar
Y pidiendo de rodillas
La miel de tu sonrisa

Perdóname, quise vivir la vida
Y me deje llevar
Perdóname y una luz encendida
Me hizo regresar
(Perdóname, perdóname, perdóname, perdóname)

Perdóname amor, perdóname

Pintaras de gris la vida si te vas
Antes de que duela vete así en caliente

Si te vas, media vuelta punto en contra
Si te vas, tu mis libros yo tus cosas

Rodará mis zapatos por la calle a la deriva

Kaiser Chiefs,"Hey, I'm back again
Did I see you in the park?
But the evening came
And I lost you in the dark

Passed the village green
Where you were crouching by the bins
You were on your own
And hanging by the swings

And I was surprised
Now I'm not surprised
That you changed your mind
And you tried to hide (x2)

And I don't feel comfortable talking
To anybody except you
I don't feel comfortable talking
To anybody else

Hey, I'm back again
Was the world too small for you?
You were gone a year
And you'd done everything to do

It's a sad affair
Because nobody ever wins
Down the fire escape
I'll meet you by the bins

And I was surprised
Now I'm not surprised
That you changed your mind
And you tried to hide (x2)

And I don't feel comfortable talking
To anybody except you
I don't feel comfortable talking
To anybody else

And so far it's been civilised
So far it's been fine
It's just the way it used to be
Remember that you're mine

And I don't feel comfortable talking
To anybody except you
I don't feel comfortable talking
To anybody else (x2)

It doesn't pass enough so I have nine
And everything to do is done for you

And it's 'cause secretly I know
I'll be home soon
But that's true

Have another cup to celebrate
It doesn't cheer me up so I have eight
Put my stuff in the washing machine
And you know when it goes in dirty
It comes out clean
There's not much on the TV this afternoon
Except Boone

In my room there's not a lot to do
So if I let you in please don't touch anything
And in my room there isn't much to do
So if I let you in

Down I go just maybe, down I go my lady.
One more shot and then down I go my lady

Down I go just maybe, down I go my lady.
One more shot and then down I go my lady
Down I go just maybe down I have to go.......

Collecting dust with tears
Making mine, white feathers
They've been here for years

Kajagoogoo,"(VERSE 1)
Nobody knew the people who were needing to save time 
So anxious to the little few unnecessary crime 
Wo! Everyone saw your reasons for cruising for the ride 
Oh! Breaking law was all he said, why don't you step inside? 

(CHORUS 1)
This car (this car) 
This car is fast! Ah ah wo! Ah ah wo!
This car (this car) 
This car is fast! Ah ah wo! Ah ah wo!

(VERSE 2)
So keep it in mind, you generally find a life just rushing by 
Exceptionally and obviously some people will even try 
No! Sympathy is what I feel, but who would even care, get on this! 
When life is slow and the pressure's on, just let down the hair 

(CHORUS 2)
This car (this car) 
This car is fast! Ah ah wo! Ah ah wo!
This car (this car) 
This car is fast! Ah ah wo! 

(MIDDLE)
Nobody has to know 
The secret though 
The world will want to know 

(VERSE 3)
As I understand, this car is grand, it's a leader in its field 
So! Though simple it seems to drive easily, and the guarantee is sealed 
Don't wonder how to drive this car, just a simple simple rule to know, know that 
You should drive at the maximum speed, because we don't want to get bored!

(FINAL CHORUS)
This car (this car) 
This car is fast! Ah ah wo! Ah ah wo!
This car (this car) 
This car is fast! Ah ah wo! Ah ah wo!

If they keep I?m torn beside
We?d better run and hide

Kaki King,"Jessica says she'd wait for me
I'd be eighteen when 
She is turning twenty-three
Decorates her room with greeting cards

They burn up when she turns the light on in the dark
Trying to remember love that never really was
When the milk tasted like perfume
You had been drinking from the carton",Jessica
Kaki King,"2 O'Clock you're still sleeping
When you wake up you'll be in such pain.
And I wait with the plate, piled high with my love
That you wont eat from

Love, you think you can contain me
But the future is already known
We give up our rest, and the best of us though
We'd be better off alone

There's no need to be so terrible
When you know I would do anything for you
This is so laughable, whatever happened to
Knowing that this was forever.
File off the sharpness of feelings so
I'll be protected from all of your evil
When you come round my love, I'll be gone, finally done
Never to come to your rescue.",2 O'Clock
Kaki King,"The tyranny of trying to know
Everything takes over the freedom of the mind
To find it's own quest knowing more about

Of violence fair to these not then quandary
Fainting of the tendrils that are in my chest as my mate and me are

[Chorus]
Pull me out
Pull me out alive
Pull me out
Pull me out alive

Oh take me to cities where all hot spots are
Inform the institutions from the defunct
Soviet union when every arrow
Will be defined as post war to be a bossed
College course right if the universe is raised
And then body you will

And with every passing minute, so much joy wrapped up in it

Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love
And now, I've got a song to sing, 
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me reason for living 
And oh, you taught me the meaning of giving
 
Oh, oh! heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love
To find a love like yours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror and I'm glad 
To see laughter in the eyes where tears used 
To be
 
What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much girl I've yet to learn
And I want to show my appreciation, cause when I found you
I found a new inspiration

And I'm not complaining, but I wish it were raining

How it might have turned out

I know you've got the time to care
But if you want to run, run, run

Do you ever stop to think about when we would run, run, run?
And fall, fall in the whites
They cut us in, they cut us out

Have you seen the world's been falling down
I know you've got the time to care
But if you want to run, run, run
If you want to run run run

Let your spirit fly
Don't you fly too high
When your wings fall to ground
You never see it come
'Cause you're always moving on
Don't be afraid to come where you belong

What she doesn't know is we all feel the same

Taking the same route for twenty-two years
A suit and a tie to dress up his fears
A left turn on Yonge as the radio blare
Sometimes it's almost like somebody's there

To all the questions that move 'round your head
To all the mysteries the key to unsaid
Love is the answer, love is the answer

Morning is breaking a light from its sleep
Strangers awaking that never will meet
One day we're born, one day we die
Millions of lonely people wake up and try
They all wake up and try

To all the questions that move 'round your head
To all the mysteries the key to unsaid
Love is the answer, love is the answer

To all the questions that move 'round your head
To all the mysteries the key to unsaid
Love is the answer, love is the answer",Try

Here, making each day of the year

Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

And if she's beside me I know I need never care

I'll be feeling lonely

Where can love be
Tell me why it's so hard to find somebody
Who will stand by me
And take the time to understand
And show me love again
I want the real thing
Or nothing at all
I need someone that I can be sure will catch me
If I should fall
Someone who'll be there when I call
Then I'll know that it's the real thing
I want the real thing
To warm me each night
Someone to love me over and over
Making the future bright
Somebody who will make it all right
Just give me the real thing
Where is the moon?
Won't it smile

Let your beams come down
And fill my empty room
Here comes the night
But if there's still a chance
That love can find me
I'll be here
Crossing my fingers
I want to know for sure
That I can feel secure
Knowing I've found an everlasting love
And once I get that under control
Then I won't let go

Kaleidoscope,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Siempre has dado luz a lo que tocas

(Hoo)
I fell in love
Todo lo que se es que voy tras de tu cuerpo
(Yeah)
why a donde voy
Siempre me he quedado a verte desde lejos

Quiero vibrarte, quiero sentirte, quiero escaparme
Voy tras de ti
Como fue que cambiaste la vida
A este pobre loco que volvio suicida de la guerra del amor

El sol se va muriendo a cada paso que tu das
Te juro baby que mi amor no puede mas

Kalimba,"Ever since I saw you walking down with your men
Paying no attention barely graving your hand
Obvious to see that he don't give a damn
He don't love you.

See you later on, all alone at the bar
I don't know your name, but I know who you are
Love to make you feel like a superstar
Know you want to.

[Chorus]
Cause baby I'll drive you crazy
Giving you what you need every time you please
I said baby, don't need to worry
Just come with me tonight.

I want to go deep, deep, deep undercover
Want to, want to, be your down low lover
When you're in between my sheets
You'll be losing sleep
Rolling undercover with me.

I want to go deep, deep, deep undercover
Got to be discreet when it comes to each other
So if he sees me in the streets, he won't know it's me
Keep it undercover with me.

Sending you a message only you'll understand
Meet me on the low for a little romance
I'll make your body sing while your heart star to dance
Yeah! you'd love to
See it in your eyes girl I know you're afraid
But, by the way you move, you got something to say
Whisper in my ears, come and take me away
Yeah I'd love to

[Chorus]

Lay with me, we don't need to think about tomorrow
Then you'll see how good love is
For a while, baby let me take away your sorrow
Anything to see you smile.

Close to me, want to hold you tight
When I give you love
Come on, come on, can't you see
Let me show you real love, a man that could give you wath you need
Don't think about it just feel me.

Kalimba,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Si sigues ahi, contesta me

Yo sé todo me sale bien
Siempre seguro porque soy un egoísta
Y sé que el mundo está a mis pies
Porque la suerte me acompaña día a día

Yo sé que soy tan especial
Que se desmayan cuando muestro mi sonrisa
Tal vez yo soy un talismán
Y el que me toca puede mejorar su vida

Pero después vienes tú
Y entonces todo cambió
Tembló y se apaga mi luz
Y todo porque no me quieres ver

Yo sé todo me sale mal
Te me metiste y ahora vivo en agonía
También el mundo se me va
Y es que la suerte me abandona cada día

Llegaste y me transformaste
Me hechizaste y no puedo vivir sin ti
Deshaces lo que un día amaste
Me partes no quieres saber nada de mi

Y sabes bien que eres tú

So don’t you get caught up in no drama, no
And I know you wanna look like the models, yeah
But ain’t nobody else like you
So go and do what you do

Look
Ok, so lately I been thinkin’ a lot about the present
And what it really means to really be present like
Counting blessings and not really stressing
Bank accounts are cool but they say the best things
In this life all come free
So tell me the real definition of what it means to succeed
Might be a little different than what you see on TV
And it’s a big big world past your cell phone screen
So keep your head up and your eyes open wide
And make sure that your happiness starts from inside
Listen to your heart and you won’t get a lie
And you’re the only you and that’s hekka tight, yeah
But confidence is key, believe in yourself and I promise you’ll see
Don’t let insecurity, distractions make it hard for you to see 
Today actually happen cause

We ain’t never promised tomorrow, no
So don’t you get caught up in no drama, no
And I know you wanna look like the models, yeah
But ain’t nobody else like you
So go and do what you do

So think negative and you can see negative 
But think positive and you can see positive
And I know that this might sound a little random
But if you get the opportunity don’t be scared
To give someone a compliment
Wait, stop the beat. Let’s just talk for a second:
Remember what I was saying about really being present?
‘Cause the song is about to be over in a minute but if you
Get some time later, just think about those lyrics.
And then we back into it, I just had to make that clear
It’s kinda crazy how we both ended up right here 
‘Cause I don’t really know you and you don’t really know me
But I do know what’s meant to be will be
Trust the journey that this life is gonna take you 
Be true to who you are, love yourself and embrace you
Everything else seems to fall in place
It’s a beautiful day for today today

Siempre encuentro consuelo
Porque aunque tú estés lejos
Es el mismo techo

Si escribo poemas en que
Hable de tus recuerdos
Sé que tu oracion en respuesta
Es pierdes tu tiempo

why el mismo no es en vano
He vivido demasiado
Aún con tanta historia
Tú estás, why permanecerás

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Mirando entre las calles
Yo hallé tu silueta
Why voy desesperadamente
A entregarte un abrazo

No llego a la esquina del tren
A enfrentar mi fracaso
Por miedo a saber quien es ella
Que hoy coge tu mano

El tiempo no es en vano
He vivido demasiado
Aún con tanta historia
Tu estas, why permanecerás

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Que dificil es borrar
Memorias más allá del cuerpo
Convertiste el amor en todo un misterio

why aunque ya no estés, no importa
Ya solo basta con saberlo

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Seras mi estigma de amor
Ya es orgullo saber que
Tu boca me perteneció

Wounded by a gun never fired humanity
Twisted form genotype inside lethal decease
From generation to others will occur

World in its forms is dying
Polymorphism is ruined
Or?

Are these changes in system meant to be done?
How fast will proceed this process that slowly begun?

Silence will creep over the planet final era
Component parts of life remains combination
And under control of creator the new race will born",Alteration
