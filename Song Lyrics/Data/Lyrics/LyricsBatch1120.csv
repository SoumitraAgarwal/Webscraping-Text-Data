RiverMaya,"If I could choose to live my life
There'll be no ifs to say
If I would choose to hold your hand
There'll be no words to say

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around

If I would choose to touch you there
Will you touch me there too?
And if you choose to stay with me
I'll spend my life with you

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around

If I could choose to live my life
There'll be no ifs to say
If I would choose to hold your hand
There'll be no words to say

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around",If
RiverMaya,"Nobody knows
Just why we're here
Could it be fate
Or random circumstance
At the right place
At the right time
Two roads intertwine

And if the universe conspired
To meld our lives
To make us
Fuel and fire
Then know
Where ever you will be
So too shall I be

Close your eyes
Dry your tears
'Cause when nothing seems clear
You'll be safe here

From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Weary heart
You'll be safe here

Remember how we laughed
Until we cried
At the most stupid things
Like we were so high
But love was all that we were on
We belong

And though the world would
Never understand
This unlikely union
And why it still stands
Someday we will be set free
Pray and believe

When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here

Save your eyes
From your tears
When everything's unclear
You'll be safe here

From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Wounded heart

When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here

In my arms
Through the long cold night
Sleep tight
You'll be safe here

When no one understands
I'll believe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe here
Put your heart in my hands
You'll be safe here",You'll Be Safe Here
RiverMaya,"Wag kang mabahala sa kahol ng mga aso
Ligtas ang pag-asang nakasakay sa ating mga palad at balikat
?Wag mong patulan, ?wag mong sakyan ang mga talangka
Panis ang angas sa respeto?t pagpapakumbaba
Walang matayog na pangarap
Sa bayang may sipag at t?yaga

Isang ugat, isang dugo
Isang pangalan, Pilipino
Isang tadhanang lalakbayin
Isang panata, isang bandila

Pekeng bayani
Pekeng paninindigan
Subukan naman nating pagtulung-tulungan
Paglayang ating minimithi
Hindi alamat, hindi konsepto
Ang bayanihang minana mo

Isang landas na tatahakin

Riverrock,"I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Rivers Cuomo,"It's like a holocaust to the boss when I toss
Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost
In a shuffle of feet, Jinx the fiddler
And I control your mind like Hitler

You bow and vow to authority
See now, a sucker with a style just boring me
So I show K N O W L E D G E, it might trouble you
Then I transform like a decepticon
With a mic as a bomb

I'm solo, you ask how I'm living
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon
With the L, the E, the N, the C, the H
The M, the O, the B, the great

Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha
It's the hip hopper that don't like coppers
And if you try to upset the pot sun
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun

I make the beats, I make the breaks
I make the rhymes that make you shake
Make you find, Ice Cube never caught in the middle
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little

And still never hesitate to stutter step
Or bust a repetition on the mic
Still dissing all the hype from left to right
How many left to fight?
So what that Lench Mob like?",The Bomb

Rivers Cuomo,"Come and walk with me
Through the world we love so much
And we'll kill all the beautiful things
We're not allowed to touch
We could fall in love
Then hate 'cause love never lasts
And we'll dance on the graves of our enemies
Won't that be a blast?

But oh, I'm ending my life with you
'Cause you're sharp as a knife
We're lost in the forest like Hansel and Gretel

Rivers Cuomo,"Well it's been building up inside of me
For, oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong

But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

[Chorus]
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now
Because I pushed the other guys too far

She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

[Chorus]

She told me baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I love you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you

Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

I can't stop partying, partying

Oh, I can't stop partying, partying
I can't stop, partying, partying
I got to have the cars
I got to have the jewels
And if you was me, honey, you would do it too

Monday to Sunday I get all the clubs
And everybody knows me when I pull up
I got the really big posse with the ARP
And if you're looking for me I'm in VIP

Just follow the smoke, they're bringing bottles of the Goose
And all of the girls in the corner are getting loose
Screw rehab I love my addiction
No sleep, no sleep I am always on a mission

Because I can't stop partying, partying
I can't stop partying, partying

Rivers Cuomo,"Suddenly our shortcomings don't seem to matter at much
Your IQ is 20 points low

Waiting for me
You'll always be my girlfriend
I too am waiting for you
I'll always be your friend

I commend your stubbornness
Without it we'd never got this far

Chasing her leaves me with nothing but pain

Unlike you
She isn't true
She's got her own concerns
You never gave up

Getting harder to pretend is ok with me

In this moment I believe
And I want it so much
In spite of everything

Lurkin' inbetween the buildings, certainly discrete

Take that in to the count like your bank said,

When I say best, I mean best?,
As the best decision,
To see lesser limits

Rizzle Kicks,"Diiiiieeeeee Miss Illusion,
Mmm yeah I love it when my lips are on her,
There’s a spark in our relationship I plant a kiss upon her,
I **** around too much and there’s a risk that I'm a goner,
So I've got her on hand like a badge of honor,
The downside is she’s never there when I'm lacking dollar,
So I've got to try and go through a day without acting bothered,
In the hope she’d leave me alone because I'm better off her,
But I see that spark and I just accept the offer,

So many people say why are you with her,
And I'm like; she’s a damn good kisser,
She feeds my addiction,
She leaks something different,
The smoke from our last meeting has risen,
Keep her away from all of the other boys,
'Cause you know she’s every single cutters choice,
Always there when the cold nights are lurking,
Gotta keep hold of my Golden virgin,

I think she’s good for me,
That's why I don’t want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be,
She’s there when I'm in need,
But she isn’t cheap,
The last time I saw her,
Mostly I couldn’t breathe,
And they say she’s bad for me,
But they say she’s bad for me,
But I don’t think she’s bad for me,
But it’s a bit of a miss illusion,

She’s got a mate called Benson,
But he’s a bitter of a waster,
Always chats about silver and gold,
But I don’t think that he’s safe (right?)
Plus his mate like’s to come out at break time,
Try’s to act bad but I've smoked him like 8 times!,
And if I take it the wrong places then I face a fine,
And if I don’t take it much she say’s its a waste of time,
In fact she doesn’t lie,
She tells me that she’s bad for me,
Even when I patch things up I don’t feel like I have to leave,

I said I had to leave; I had to get away,
It’s funny when I'm not around I've seen better days,
Sometimes I demonstrate how to set it straight,
I filter out the bullshit and keep her locked in case,
But when I'm chilling she’s always in my mind,
I do her out but the doubts are just glassed in side,
I should respond in time but then I found out,
The last boy she kissed coughed and died,

I think she’s good for me,
That's why I don’t want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be,
She’s there when I'm in need,
But she isn’t cheap,
The last time I saw her,
Mostly I couldn’t breathe,
And they say she’s bad for me,
But they say she’s bad for me,
But I don’t think she’s bad for me,
But it’s a bit of a miss illusion,

M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be,
M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be,
Can you please leave my vicinity,
Can you please leave my vicinity,
Actually wait nah I'll have another kiss,
Oh **** I'm in love with this chick what this its,
Straight robbery,
She’s always there when I'm by myself and I can’t remain solitary,
Babe honestly,
It appears that your bad for my health and a quick way to poverty,
You went from my pal to my lover,
Now I see you outside with thousands of other,
But you’re on my mind right now,
So I guess I'm coming down from another little fling,
Gotta confess this,

I think she’s good for me,
That's why I don’t want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn’t be,
She’s there when I'm in need,
But she isn’t cheap,

Thinking of decision that I made within a heart beat!
She used to make my heartbeat but usually alarms me my lungs are over
Working and I (Can't breathe)
Yes I convinced myself I didn't like relationship malarkey,
And she says ""wait, you didn't ask me... (How I felt)""
I said I love that your a (nice girl), and I'm sorry
But this really wasn't time well,
And it kinda feels like it may be a blur,
Maybe coffee and telly is what I mainly prefer,
Feel I gotta scratch the surface gotta break it to learn,
And now I multiply the times in which the tables have turned!

I call this the traveler's chant!
Whether you sitting on a train or in the back of a car,

Do I start at the end or do I end at the start,
And in this little bit of time will I get very far?
Maybe it's me, yes I do have places to be!
And I'll be there!
Yes, yeah the other day I was sitting on the train but in another place,
I was on my way home, or maybe some would say,
I was thinking bout the days I wanna run away,
I've only really gotta couple mates, me, myself and I, how cliche,
Looking out the window, feels like I'm in a film,
Director, producer and as it happens I'm the main (character),
Yeah my own little feature, length sound track being
Whatever's in my speakers (then),
I'd rather not be held accountable I bank on peoples feelings
It's no wonder why I'm feeling spent, yeah and in a deeper sense,
Sometimes I need the rain it helps me kinda clean my head,
The suns an easy friend, I'm thinking maybe the duration of my journey
Helped me reconnect my feelings then!

We were moving to the music
We were busting some shakes
I said I wanted a fag
But they were loving the bass
So I headed to the smoking bit to puff in and wait
And then this kiddy, obviously had summin' to say

Is to conserve your energy unless you feel it's right

I thought damn, this puts me in a difficult position
Three against one, but then my mates came in my vision
Fully backing it became the obvious decision
And its funny how these idiots were acting kind of different like nah

Rjd2,"A Beautiful mind, turned water into wine
But that's not all
Broke the water, shined through
Shaped the earth, created the colder life
Radiated with energy, the great boat of life
The spark
Sparkling through the dark night
Then walked
And took forever without a thing in sight
Didn't hear a sound to the first ""treat""
""Deaf to the ocean swelled"" washed up a miracle
A Beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

By the grace of fire, out sprouts the land
And did desire, footprints in the sand
On top of the mountain peak where the man speaks to himself
Cursing to them with a start
What he felt can't be described
It's alive
Rise with the tide
Communicate with all sides, nothing wants to die
Buildin' this, build a bridge
Build a tower
Construct a dam, nigga, ho
Build a flower
Ultraviolet rays magnified the essence
All praise to the presence, one pure thought
Taught him the lessons
This spread with the first migration of the heads
The first wants to flock

A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine
One's so enlightened; one's so divine
The planet's hour line, all devoid of time
A beautiful mind

They opened up the brain and opened up the heart
What is man made of
Love from the dark
The will to invent the will
Work the field, the shield, the intent to kill, the uphill
Matter of existence, matter of persistence,
Matter of distance to search for the mystics
Finder of lost souls, teacher of apostles, the mind's so colossal
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, a beautiful idea
One that was right here, blind to the naked eye, tied to a fear
Once it was nothing and now it is here
A beautiful mind

Not accidental, coincidental, experimental
A beautiful man, though a touch so gentle
A life so simple to spin on the axis to access the temple
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, put fruit on the vine
At the same time he made love a crime
Mellowed out the strings of all mankind
Walked along side you when you was left behind
Purified the waters, carved the canyons
Fed the families when it was starved and famine
Drew the blueprints so everyone had a chance
Organized the people and made man advance
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

Something outa nothing
Oh, what a far cry
More than a hard tribe
Pointed out the start guide
Made love, made hate
Saved sake
Nothing left the crate but fate
Constructed structures, ? a labyrinth
Detailed a portrait
Healed nations
Took blame when no one else was happening
Evolved the species, and had patience
Wrote the scroll in thousands of languages
Came with us to fight against a giant ?
Created chaos, pervaded destruction
Made law and order and then corruption
Laid the foundation for all things to stand on
Then cleared the ground for the mother ship to land on

Sailed across the seas, followed the breeze
Cured disease
Made poison
Settled the fear, took them on the righteous path,
Gave them the math, and still had the time to laugh

Rjd2,"Yeah.
Yo, what up?
This is Aceyalone.
What's happening?
Yo. 
Let me tell you a story real quick about one of my partners,
About this cat I know. 
One of my homeboys, and we just gonna call him Junior.
Yeah, Junior got some money just for being a good kid.
He sealed it up and never even opened up the lid.
Girls gave him candy cause he treated him nice.
He took it home and chopped it up, and doubled up the price.
Miss Thomas at the parent's conference said we honest.
She was astonished at his confidence and what he accomplished.
He respected his elders, but he knew who he liked.
He listened before he talked, and he never would fight.
It's like, everybody knew him or they wanted to know him,
And anytime they did something for him, they felt that they owed him.
He was learning a life game that no one would show him.
He had more than an idea of where he was going.
He grew into a young man and gained some trust,
And he had a knack for pleasing people, and that was a plus.
Any situation he was in, he would adjust.
He never cussed, and he never fussed what he discussed.

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
We was the same age, but I still looked up to him because we had this thing together.
Some people just got that knack, and you can't do nothing about it.
But they end up being a victim of circumstance because he's on the rise and, you know, he's gotta battle against the odds,
And my man had such a good demeanor. 
He was smart, man. 
And he was a hustler.
And he had his ? up. 
And he had a natural ability to bring people together,
And which people he brought together.

By the time he turned 26, he was a...
He was becoming a young prince with a whole lot of sense.
Not only could he make money hustling white,
He had a little bit of everything to get you some height.
They made cash with him so nobody wanted to hit him,
But they'd get him if they had to get him, get rid of him quick.
But why kill off the goose if you're making grip,
And why kill off the captain if you run a good ship?
Some people are strong,
Some people are weak.
Other are smart, but still don't got a stomach for the streets.
But Junior had a different angle, he was an angel. 
The Calypso changed, though ?
The game could tango.
'Cause he can't tango.
A dance with wolves or waltz with a rattlesnake,
What would it prove?
They started salting ? up his program, hoping he'd lose.
But he stayed cool, and he stayed steady, making moves.

Yeah, okay. 
Meanwhile, Junior's off doing his thing, and living up to his full potential,
But the haters, and I don't even want to call them that cause they're worse than that,
But he's become a victim of the monster. 
You know, the machine, the revolving door.
It's them that got versus them that can't get, and ain't gonna never get.

Junior had it good.

Man, four years later, Junior got him a nice stack.
Compared to what he used to have, now he's got twice that.
When beef is at his door, he decided to ice that.
Now knowing more and more, he was caught in a mice trap.
He wanted to fight back.
But who could he tell?
The lesser of the two evils would just put him in a cell.
Everybody around knew that Junior was frail,
But he didn't need muscles to make it, all he needed was a scale.
A hundred and twenty-thousand in cold hard cash,
A stash at gun blast that don't even ask.
You get beat by the only one thing that can beat you,
Defeat you, cheat you, the streets will eat you.
Jealousy and envy make a person deceitful,
Then you add greed to it,
Combonation is lethal.

Well it's a short life knowing that it won't be a sequel.
Sometimes bad things just happen to good people.

Yeah. So they killed him. 
They murdered him in cold blood.
He died face-down in front of an empty safe.
And for the fools that did this, I hope you rot in hell.
I hope you live in hell.
For my nigga, Junior.
Rest in peace.

Junior had it good.",Junior
Rjd2,"A bunch of wild boys was hanging around
At the local neighborhood saloon
And some cat kept dropping quarters down in the jukebox
Playing all the favorite tunes

And back by the bar playing cards looking hard
Was big bad Solomon Jones
And watching over his luck
Was the love of his life
Is the lady that was known as Simone

When out of the night which was dark and cold
Into the smoke-filled dimly-lit room
Stumbled in a thug
Who was smelling like bud
And his eyes looked high as the moon

He looked like a man with his foot in the grave
And his lifetime about to be out
Yet he slapped down some hundred-dollar bills on the bar
And he yelled out ""drinks on the house""

Now nobody could place where this dude was from
But we knew that he was far from home
But we drank to his health
And the last to drink was big bad Solomon Jones

Now there are some G's
Who just run the streets
And they live life in and out of jail
And such was he, that kind of OG
That looked like he'd been through hell

With his hair in cornrows
A mean mug grill
Like a dog who's day is done
He lit up the green stuff in his cigar
And took hits one by one

Now I got to thinking who this cat could be
And what the hell is- going on
Well I turned around and who was staring at him
The lady that was known as Simone

And the white t-shirt all stained with dirt
He was trying not to be rude
But he was trying to find another
Good song on the jukebox
So he could just set the mood

Have you ever been out in the city streets
With the gang-made players so clear
Where the police and gangsters control the block
And gunshots is all that you hear

When the only sounds are the drums of war
And you left out in the cold
A half-dead man in a half-dead world
And a yellow-brick road to go

Then all of a sudden the music changed
And everyone just held their post â?¨But it felt like a life had been robbed from you
And everything that you held close
Â?¨That someone has stolen the women you love
And that her love was a devil's lie â?¨That your heart was gone and the best thing that you could do is crawl away and die â?¨It's the painful cry of a man's despair deep down in his bones â?¨I guess misery enjoys company, said big bad Solomon Jones

And the stranger turned
And his eyes had burned
In a most peculiar way
And the white t-shirt that was stained in dirt
He sat in to watch me sway

Then his mouth had frowned up in this kind of grin
And he spoke in a voice so clear
""Boys you don't know who I am
And I know that you just don't care""

""Now I'ma say these words
'cause these words are true
And when I'm done here I'll be gone
But one of you boys is a shiesty dog
And his name is Solomon Jones""

Then I ducked my head
And the lights went out
And two guns blazed in the dark
Then I women swooned
And the lights came on
And the two men laced with the starch.

With a bullet in his head
And pumped full of lead
Was big bad Solomon Jones

What a thug from the street
Who was hoeing his heat
And who knows to that lady named Simone












",Solomon Jones
Rjd2,"Supahero
Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero
And Superman don't fly no more cause he ain't one with the people
He ain't nowhere to be found, when he should be fighting evil

You make me whole It's not the movies, but it fake the role
I try to take control for the sake of soul
But the only thing I get to do is scrape the bowl
When God made me, said â??break the moldâ??
I put foot to the concrete and shake the road
I don't have powers like a caped crusader
But I do have powers like an Ace invader
Back in the days he had so much flavor
He was so major to get you out of danger
Now you can't find him, and he's just a stranger
And if you did he'd probably give you the finger
Your hit channel's evil on your channel changer
And your hero with a lifesaver threw you an anchor

I really don't know what you thinking of
I can't make it wet from underneath my glove
I can't see through walls but I can see through you
You dress up the ball but that's all you do
You fell for him, he didn't fall for you
And just me is what I got to offer you
I don't save the day, I just pave the way
In the city of Gotham where every day's a day
I know it pays to play, but I ain't playing
I ain't laying my coat down; know what I'm saying?
You want lots of muscles and lots of green
But my hustle and bustle is my only thing
It ended all bad as my last song seems
You need a star in your life and not in your dreams



",Supahero
RKM & Ken-Y,"Amigo, ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

Amigo, para nosotros siempre serás amigo
Te haz marchado pues lo quizo el destino
En nuestra mente siempre estarás vivo
Amigo, amigo

Entre llantos y tristezas hoy amigo te despido
Piediéndole al Señor que en sus brazos tu estas dormido
Con mis lágrimas voy recordando todo lo que hicimos
La ocurrencias que hicimos, en el barrio cuando crecimos

Mirando al cielo pido a Dios que te perdone
Siempre te recordaremos en nuestros corazones
Fuistes un amigo en las buenas y en las malas
Siento un dolor tan grande ahora por que te marchas

Amigo,ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

Amigo, para nosotros siempre serás amigo
Te haz marchado pues lo quizo el destino
En nuestra mente siempre estarás vivo
Amigo, amigo

Que es lo que debo hacer para yo conformarme
Si dia a dia lo que hago es recordarte
Quisiera tenerte frente a frente y explicarte
Para que veas cuanta falta tu me haces

Que es lo que debo hacer para yo conformarme
Si dia a dia lo que hago es recordarte
Quisiera tenerte frente a frente y explicarte
Que aunque te hayas ido, tu siempre serás

Amigo, ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

Amigo, para nosotros siempre serás amigo
Ta haz marchado pues lo quizo el destino
En nuestra mente siempre estaras vivo
Amigo, amigo

RKM & Ken-Y,"Huh
Las mujeres no son las unicas que tienen sentimientos
Mamita te voy a hablar claro
Yo me siento mal, muy mal
Ken-why, explicales

Ayer me dijistes que me amabas
Que no habria quien nos separara
Que yo era tuyo why tu eras mia
Para nuestro amor no habian medidas
Pero de repente todo cambio
Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor
Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon
Tu no sabes cuanto daño la hare a mi corazón, perderte

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo
Que sin ti me desespero
[Muñecatu eres la razon que yo hago]
[Todo esto es la razon qYo trabajo tan duro]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente]

Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon
Pero no entiendo la razon
Porque siento como tu why yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor
Estamos acostumbrao'
Why no estamos enamorao'
O maybe es algo que da duro
Why viene why se va como un morao
Pero mami let's work it out
Es un daño profundo
Pensar en los años
Que tu why yo viviamos juntos
Why que, todos esos años se fueron por gusto? (No, no..)
No me digas eso mami
Eso yo no lo puedo aceptar
Un amor como el nuestro es real
Un amor tan profundo
Yo te apuesto el mundo
Que tu te sientes igual
Un amor que no se puede olvidar
Un amor que no se puede ocultar
Un amor tan rico why tan fuerte
Que no se puede dudar

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo
Que sin ti me desespero
[Muñecatu eres la razon que yo hago]
[Todo esto es la razon qYo trabajo tan duro]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente]

Como pudiste lastimarme
Si lo unico que hice fue amarte
Creo que merezco una, explicacion
Creeme, he tratado de olvidarte
Why lo unico que he logrado es recordarte
Dime, como aguantar tanto dolor
(No, no, no)

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo
Que sin ti me desespero
[Pero, pero mamita tu no entiendes?]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Tu eres la mujer que yo quiero,
Yo te kiero dar el mundo, yo te adoro
Hazme el favor why escuchame mamita]

Dime mami que es lo que tu sientes
Dime mami que es lo que tu quieres
Mira mi hija, tu sabes que la vida mia
Esta en la boca de toda la gente
Chisme por aqui, chisme por alla
Yo lo vi por aqui, yo lo vi por alla
Yo lo vi con esta, yo lo vi con esa
Entonces yo te llamo why tu no contestas
Yo te amo, yo te quiero
Yo te adoro, mi cielo
Yo quiero, vivir, mi vida, contigo
Yo te quiero complacer
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime
Yo te quiero complacer
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime!

Dime que debo hacer si la verdad es que no puedo
Alejarme de ti, olvidarme de ti, mamita yo no quiero
No me pidas más que no, no te voy a complacer
Si todo estaba muy bien
Dime amor, en que falle!!?
En que falle?
En que falle?
En que falle?

(No, no, no)

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)
(Que no me vaya no) (no)
Que no ves que ya no puedo
Que sin ti me desespero
No me pidas que me vaya, no

Ja, ja, ja, ja

Hoy he desperta'o
Acariciando la noticia de que tú no volverás
Desorienta'o, dando vueltas en mi cama
Pensando si me amas, yo que te he ama'o
Como nadie, como loco, amores como el mío pocos hay
Duermo solea'o, rocha'o porque te has marcha'o
Y hoy desperté en la misma casa, en el mismo cuarto
En la misma cama en donde te ame
Y eso me pone down, down

(Down!) Si no tengo de tu piel
(Down!) Si no tengo tu calor
(Down!) Si no tengo tu querer
Si no tengo de tu amor
Mami, yo me pongo down
(Down!) Girl, I'm dying for your love

Trastorna'o en las noche lloro como un mamao
Con cuantas gatas yo eh basila'o pero a cada
Pichón le llega su guaragua'o casi ni duermo
De tus labios enfermo como un ni~o si le quitan su
Telmo y mas enfermo con to lo que ah pasao
Las escapas y las chotias del cuñao
Y yo empezao con dormir a tu lao
Y devorarte mami de un bocao aun que me

And my life is going down
Porque no te tengo aquí

Oh, baby
Girl, can't you see
Que yo no puedo vivir sin ti
And my life is going down
So down
Porque no te tengo aquí
Porque no estas junto a mí
Oh, baby
You make me feel so down

Desorienta'o, en llanto desperté
Acariciando la noticia de no tenerla a usted
Entiéndanme, los hombres también lloran
Y más cuando se va la persona que mas adoran
Estoy en baja, down, ya no tengo ni palabras
Pensando en ti, dando vueltas en la cama
No es fácil vivir la agonía
De pensar en ti noche, mañana, y día
Estoy muriendo, sufriendo, yo te hago entender
Este amor yo te lo juro quise defender
Pero todo fallo en todos los intentos
No aguanto la agonía y este sufrimiento

Quitame este dolor
Que una vez el pasado
De ella me dejo

Has q se me olvide su nombre
Has q de mi mente la borre
Quita por favor con tus besos el recuerdo
Que me mantiene preso
Has que se me olvide su nombre

Por favor, no, no no! 

Vivo el recuerdo atrapado
Hazme olvidar el pasado
Quiero k tu seas la niña
Que se quede a mi lado
Yo se que puedes mi nena
Tu vas a ser mi doncella
Con tus besos why caricias
Yo la olvidare a ella
Quiero yo tenerte
Amarte why besarte
Hacerte el amor
Why a las estrellas llevarte
Tu vas hacer mia
Borra las heridas
Del pasado aquel
Que un dia marco mi vida
Mi vida

Has q se me olvide su nombre
Has q de mi mente la borre
Quita por favor con tus besos
El recuerdo q me mantiene preso

Please don't walk away
Give me a minute
Listen to what I have to say
I always put you number one in my life
Never thought we'd say goodbye

Mi amor te extraño
Cuando te siento lejos de mi
Vivir sin ti, me mata el dolor
Es que yo no soy nada sin ti
(No)

Siento en mi piel tus manos acariciándome
Te busco y no te encuentro amor
Es que yo vivo extrañándote

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasión
y me lleva volando hasta ti

Eres mi cielo, eres mi luz eres mi despertar
A ti te entrego todo sin mirar atrás
'Cause it's all about you and your future with me
Girl, it's so simple to see that this was destined to be

Abrázame, sentir que el tiempo es corto y se va
No existe la distancia en mi amor
Sera tuyo por la eternidad

Amándote, besándote y tu besándome
Descubro que estoy sintiendo que quiero morir
y amarte otra vez; sabes que

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Ouu tengo un amor que habita en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ah ah ah de mi pasión
y me lleva Volando hasta ti

Como le digo al corazon
Que ya no esta mas contigo
Sintiendo caricias tuyas si en verdad
No estas conmigo Cierro los ojos y te veo

Me refugio en tu recuerdo
y a la vez que pasa el tiempo
Me da miedo perderlo

Mi corazon se lamenta desde el día que tu te fuiste
Disimula estar sano cuando en verdad esta muy triste
Quiero saber si de verdad yo volverá a amarte
Quiero saber si siempre vivirá pa' recordarte

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasión

No se si gane o perdí no
Y me duele pensarlo

Que ya tu no estas
Y que no volverán

Es como alguien, ese alguien eres tu

Que duele mas?
Que te hayas ido, que regreses
Que el amor que no tenemos
Con el tiempo crece y crece
Pero es dañino
Afecta mas, nos duele tanto
Cuando vienes solo sufro
Cuando no reventa en llanto
Es difícil pero es mejor no volverte a ver
Porque desde tu recuerdo que me hacen comprender
Que lo nuestro es imposible
Nos hace daño
Que este amor nunca jamas podrá ser

No vuelvas
No vuelvas nunca mas

L'asfalto, il mio passato
E il mattino dopo sono punto da capo
Ho un nuovo gioco con cui mi coccolo
I compiti a casa non li portavo mai
Mi fiondo al posto con chi da prassi
Mi accompagnò ai tempi, temi possa riperdermi
E mi ami più di quanto mi aspettassi
Nel letto aspetto l'attimo giusto
Le chiavi con cui ti apro
Ti hanno tarpato le ali, rose nere nel bouquet
Intorno solo teste chinate, siamo io te e le altre
In fondo siamo pezzi di un puzzle
E passo io per lo stronzo
Gola secca senza senso
Nel frigo bar mi fiondo per primo uguale
E faccio avanti e indietro
Scrivo la mia bio in apnea
Respiro appena, respiro appena
Respiro appena-pena-pena
E scrivo la mia bio in apnea
Respiro appena
Respiro appena
Respiro appena
 
E gridi gridi gridi gridi quanto mi odi
(Tu ami me, io amo lei, lei ama lui, lei ama lui)
E gridi gridi gridi gridi quanto ti manco però
(Tu ami me, io amo lei, lei ama lui, lei ama lui)
E gridi gridi gridi gridi ""quanto ti odio!""
(Tu ami me, io amo lei, lei ama lui, lei ama lui)
E gridi gridi gridi gridi quanto mi manchi però
(Tu ami me, io amo lei, lei ama lui, lei ama lui)

E ora che non ti fai più
In giro non ci sei più
Mia madre piange se le sente
Quando stacca dall'ufficio nel suo mp3
Due lettere si incontrano per sempre
Se ci senti fammi un fischio, dai
Non scordarti la pillola
Ci mangiamo le viscere
A vicenda per l'affitto fai
Che non ero in me, sì certo
Polvere di te al setaccio
I tasti che schiacciavo al cell
Ci sto per quanto serva
Salvo i miei prima che il treno parta
Alla fermata col mio zaino
In zona sanno tutti tutto
Un tattoo per non dimenticarlo
E dormi tra le mie braccia
Ti svegli tra le mie braccia
E mi odi per come gridi
E mi ami da come parli e ridi
Per come mi odi e piangi
Per come mi ami e piangi
Non sai se mi odi e piangi
Non sai se mi ami
Non sai se mi ami

Yeah, Next, uh Lil' Zane

Come on drop the top, let cha' hair fly

It's a clear sky tonight baby

Uh, let me know what's on ya mind

It's Saturday, get the car shined up

Hair cut lined up, Heaven made my mind up

Professed one side of it tied up, won't see me there

I wonder how she wears her hair

If I see her I swear

I'm gonna put the game down like you

I'm just looking for love

I've been looking all over the club

Fresh Nikes, jeans cuffed, pressed in Sean John

Trying to find someone, someone for me

[R.L.]

I just tipped valet

Got in line through the metal detectors, stormin' days

Movin' to the sound of the DJ hoping she'll come my way

Is it the girl with the bomb weave, standin' next to me

Or is it the one with the short waves

A few are stepping but I ain't checking cause

I switch lanes when I hoop game

Bet I score the same when I shoot game

I promise baby that I change whe the loop came

I'm off to bigger, better things with my new thang

No strings attached I'm on my two-way

Hopin' that our beams'll match

Gotta see you later baby, I'm a fiend for that

Wide body Navigator but my screens are flat

Now we watchin' motion pictures sittin' right in the track

Wanna honey dip, not interested in spendin' money

But how the money flip

She ain't concerned when I earn, she make money chips

I lit the fire place, baby gave me fine face

Tell me what cha' want but shorty I'm not Mase

I'm known for drillin' in a hole like I'm I-A

Fast as a speedin' bullet on the highway

Hopin' that I'm not late

And I ain't worried bout a ticket cause I got cake

Baby I'm lookin' for love

Off comes the clown's disguise

The music softly dies

As you're filin' out the door
As they say in this business
That's all there is, there isn't anymore

We've shared a moment
And as the moment ends
I’ve got a funny feelin'
We're parting now as friends

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
If I had this to do again and the evening were new again
I would spend it with you again, but now the curtain falls

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
People say I was made for this
Nothin' else would I trade for this and to think I get paid for this

Thank you, goodnight

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

This is a beginning, message I'm sending, out
To all the rappers who think they got clout
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
want to start a battle with me, but I won't
Cause it don't make sense to me, just to see
Who's the best you see
We got a lot of negativity, in the rap industry
Battling for superiority
Who's the best? Who's the worst?
Who's the good, who's the bad? I'm mad, listen up now!

""Absolutely nothing!""
Say it again now (pump it up, pump it up, see'mon)
""War! You M-C's listen"" (uh)
""What is it good for? Absolutely nothing!"" yeah yeah

This is secondary, tell me is it necessary
To battle another brother, hurry
Tell me the answer, I want to know this
This ain't war, this is show business
Unless, I guess
You think, you're the best, I won't 'fess
I'll make peace, even though I'm strong
Another flow right along in a battle

One of the threats of all mankind

He's dead, and I'm the gladdest
A lot of rappers, they get ego's
Like kings and queens, and all my heroes
But no, I'm not claimin' no titles
Young kids, rappers they idols
I'm not a gangster, I don't diss
A lot of rappers do and I'm pissed
Like Hitler, they want to rule
But God's the ruler you fool!

[Chorus: x2]

Now you're the best, the baddest, the roughest, the toughest
Man, you ain't sayin' nothin'
to me, cause I'm another MC
(Doin' what?) Battlin' for superiority
No! That ain't true, I ain't you
And I ain't tryin to just knock you
I want to get some peace and love and happiness
And things like those you can't miss
Stand your ground, I ain't saying be a punk
(Why not?) Cause if you do, your ship'll get sunk
Cause this is war, no, this is show business
So let's get down to the bottom of this

[Chorus] 

It's funny, I don't see Patti and Luther battlin'
(Why?) It's doesn't matter and
All I want to do, is make music
Throw it on so the people can use it

En volgt het dievenspoor
Met schooiers en soldaten,
Hun petten op een oor.
Je tilt je rokken op
En lacht naar iedere man
Die in het donker wel durft
Wat overdag niet kan.
En bij nacht
In de kroegen hier,
Gaat je naam in het rond
Bij het blond schuimend bier.
Ik ken ze een voor een,
De heren van fatsoen,
Ik zal ze nooit vergeten
Zoals ze jou wel doen.
Hoe vaak heb jij zo'n kop,
Bezopen, stom en geil,
Niet aan je borst gedrukt,
Je lijf nat van zijn kwijl.
En bij nacht
In de kroegen hier,
Gaat je naam in het rond

Dan zit daar zo'n meneer,
Stijf als een houten plank
Met spijkers in zijn kop
Te kijken in zijn bank.
Een zwart lakens pak
Om zijn zondige lijf,
Bang voor de duivel
En bang voor zijn wijf.
En zuinig een cent
In het zakje doen.
Zo koopt hij zijn ziel weer terug
En zijn fatsoen.
En jij moet achteraan
In het donker ergens staan
Zoals het hoort.
Maar eens dan komt de dag,
Dan luiden ze de klok,
Dan draag jij witte bloemen
En linten aan je rok.

Wat zullen ze dan kijken,

Rob Dougan,"I want to weave a musical spell
That leaves you unwell and thinking of me everyday
I want to play you a tune that leaves you marooned and troubled
Each time I'm away
Is there a melody - that could lead you to me - like a lullabied child led to sleep?
So for one moment in time, you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep

I want to write a simple song that's so frequently sung
That you call me to have the thing banned
Who's sound so endears that whole nations cheer and sigh
When you take my hand
Is there a melody - that could lead you to me - like a lullabied child led to sleep?
So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep

God I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave
I'm a traveler - with one last mile my journey is complete
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look, before flying east
Last on my list - and then I quit - to kiss your lips and weep

I want to play a silver note that fills you with hope
And tames you to feed from my hand
A turquoise chord that invites you to soar
And fly...to a faraway land
A symphony that gently leads you to sit and be still with me
And grief doesn't frighten me
At its worst it delights me
'Cause I want to kiss you and weep

I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave

I've got no options left
I've got nothing to show now

It's not like you stayed at my side
Or you called me a priest
You searched through my mouth
To check for gold teeth
You were pawning my shoes as I bled
You left me for, left me for, left me for dead

You kept takin' your time
Until you were certain I couldn't survive
Judas remained, you turned and fled
You left me for dead

And it didn't trouble your mind
It did not disturb you to see me decline
You turned out my lights, you put me to bed
You left me for dead

And I say, I won't rest my head until Hell is your home
You think that you're safe, but oh no
You'll feel the cold of my gun hit your head
You left me for dead

And you stay close to me, didn't stay by my side
I was choking in blood as the laugh filled your eyes
You were a bum for each word that you said
'Cause you left me for, left me for dead

But I don't want to search no more
There's nowhere to hide
So, why don't you come quietly, my love
I wanted to say,
To say that you sure proved the death of me

And I can't go back
But if I'm going down you'll come with me

I don't know how long we've got left
And so, I'm asking you to forgive me,

I learn as I go, to float far away
Into silence
And just watch your face, and find some kind of grace
In that quiet bliss
Can I stay and say nothing at all
At all

Where will we go when we get old
When the bustle and the noise get too frightening
When each and every angry word
Is banished to the past
That's when I think

We'll learn as we go, to float far away
Into silence
And I watch your face, and find patience and grace
In each line there
Wake each day, up from nothing at all
At all

And these words thay I say
They mean nothing at all
At all

Will you walk into the grave with me?
Will you leave this angry world
Soft and wistful
To sink into the dark, dank earth
And never reappear, would be blissful

To float far away, into eternal space
And God's silence
Where I watch your face, and find patience and grace
In each line there
Drift away, and end up nothing at all
At all

Find the grace, to be nothing at all
At all
Fade away, and end up nothing at all

Rob Gardner,"You must have seen parties of Blockheads
With blotched and lagered skin
Blockheads with food particles in their teeth
What a horrible state they're in

They've got womanly breasts 
Under pale mauve vests
Shoes like dead pigs' noses
Cornflake packet jacket, 
Catalogue trousers
A mouth what never closes

You must have seen Blockheads 
In raucous teams
Dressed up after work
Who screw their poor old Eileens
Get sloshed and go berserk

Rotary accessory watches
Hire-purchase signet rings
A beauty to the bully boys
No lonely vestige clings

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Why shouldn't they do as they please?
You know if it came to a brainy game
You could baffle a Blockhead with ease

How would you like one puffing 
And blowing in your ear hole?
Or pissing in your swimming pool?

Bigger brained Blockheads often acquire
Black and orange cars
Premature ejaculation drivers
Their soft-top's got roll bars

'Fill her up,' they say to Blockheads
'Go on, stick it where it hurts'
Their shapeless haircuts don't enhance
Their ghastly patterned shirts

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Superior as you are
You're thoughtful and kind 
With a well-stocked mind
A Blockhead can't think very far

Imagine finding one in your laundry basket
Banging nails in your big black dog

Why should you care what they do?

From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own

Dragging iron feet

Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight,
And no one there you can kiss good night.

A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing there but gloom;
But a room is not a house,
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart.

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends it ends in tears.

Rob McConnell,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,

'Neath the halo of a street lamp,

People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""

Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

There must be someone for me

Rob McConnell,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?

She's gonna turn me down and say,

Rob McConnell,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

That makes thrice, let's make it four!

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,

Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo

The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammed will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

""This is rap for real, something you feel""
""And you know, yes you know""
""Rap for the black people""

Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortilized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

[Chorus]

Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like

Rob Rock,"Now; now that you have gone away
Where will you run, where will you stay?
You know you've been hiding for so long
See; see all the love you left behind
Leaving you stranded all alone
What will you do your lost and lonely

Caught, caught in a web of sin again
I was so blind like you I ran
Somehow I found the light to guide my way....

After all that we've been through
Love of my life, I will remember you

Forever, Forever
Forever, Love of my life

Fear; fear all the things that you once knew
Trapped in a hell lying to you
Trying to keep you from the only truth
Take; take what you want it's your own choice
And after all we hear this voice
Because we've found a love that just won't go away....

After all that we've been through
Love of my life, Lord, I long to be with you

Forever, Forever
Forever, Love of my life
Forever, Forever
Forever, Love of my life

Now, now that you have gone away
Where will you run, where will you stay?
You know you've been hiding for so long

Forever, Forever
Forever, Love of my life

Forever, Love of my life

Forever...
It was your grace that fell on me
Now your love has set me free

Judgment Day
Will the sun refuse to shine
Judgment Day
When the stars fall from the sky

Come Armageddon
The woman rides the beast
Wisdom from the heavens
Anger, plagues, disease

Judgment Day
When the stars fall from the sky
Judgment Day
Good and evil will collide
Judgment Day
There's a rider on the storm
Judgment Day
Bringing justice and the sword

Kings of earth are unclean
Babylon demon seed
Riches, splendor, blinded by her luxuries

Lead the nations astray
Kill the prophets and saints
Deluded and fallen, the mark of the beast

The beast and the dragon are false
Weeping and mourning cry out
Scavengers feast, eating your flesh

When the stars fall from the sky

Good and evil will collide

I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door

So when you tell me that you love me no for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

Open up to me like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony

So when you tell me that you love me no for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

What if I was good to you, what if you were good to me
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me
What if it was paradise, what if we were symphonies
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you

Rob Thomas,"The light from the window is fading
You turn on the night
The sound from the avenue's calling you
Open your eyes

And when you find
You're spending your time
Wanting for words
But never speak
You tell yourself
That the things you need come slow
But inside you just don't know

My, my, my
Let your bright light shine
Let your words live on
Far beyond this life
Beyond this life

Hold on to anything
Everything's over and done
Has the fear taken over you
Tell me
Is that what you want
To make up your life

Time after time
You're falling behind
Hold on to me
Never leave
Forever be what you mean to me right now

And our beauty surely gone
No you will not be forgotten
No you will not be alone
No you will not be alone
And when the day has all but ended
And our echo starts to fade
No you will not be alone then
And you will not be afraid
No you will not be afraid
When the fog has finally lifted
From my cold and tired brow
No I will not leave you crying
And I will not let you down
No I will not let you down
I will not let you down
Now comes the night
Feel it fading away
And the soul underneath
Is it all that remains
So just slide over here

Rob Thomas,"Don't let 'em get where they're going to
You know they're only what they think of you
You heard of this emotional trickery
And you felt like you were learning the ropes
But where you're going now you don't now

And when the kids on the street say
What's your problem girl
And the weight of their smile's just
Too much for you to bear
When they all make you feel
Like you're a problem girl
Remember
You're no problem at all
You're no problem at all

Pride like promises can let you down
You thought that you'd be feeling
Better by now
You worry all the things they could do to you
You worry about the things they could say
Maybe you're seeing things the wrong way

If you stand or you fall
You're no problem at all",Problem Girl

Maybe I should try to find a downtown whore

I'm a little too headstrong
Stand tall

I can't stand what I'm starting to be
I can't stand the people that I'm starting to need
There's so much now
That can go wrong
And I don't need somebody

Oh no, it ain't over now
I can feel the world spin around, around, around
Hey now, give me the meltdown 
Take it out on me, don't let me down
Oh no, it ain't over now
I can feel the world spin around, around, around

Wide awake now and your monkey's dead
You so perfect that you never really need nobody
Put your hands down
You're among your friends
You just take and take and take and take and take and take and

Late at night, late at night
You weep but you're no better than the secrets you keep stay down
Just lay down, here, close to me
Pretend you'll never leave me

[Chorus]

Tell me what you want child
Give me the meltdown
Take it out on me this time around
Oh no, it ain't over now

Take it out on me, don't let me down
Oh no, it ain't over now

You do everything that I can't do
Sometimes I get lost in my blue
Please forgive me if I'm hard on you
Please forgive me if I'm hard on you

You're the only thing that I cant lose
The nights are peaceful here in our room
Please forgive me if I'm hard on you
Please forgive me if I'm hard on you

Cause I didn't mean to be mean 
When I said all the things I said to you
But maybe the worst is the best I can do
With you
And I never want you to go but I know
I've been moving way too slow
And I fall apart cause its all that I know
I know, I know

Rob Thomas,"Oh what the hell she says
I just can't win for losing
And she lays back down
Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doin'
Like I don't know now

By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night
Can make you blind
I can just imagine
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

And she says, oh
I can't take no more

And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

Way down

Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
But it don't feel right

By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

And she says, oh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
Tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
She'll be alright
She'll be alright
Just not tonight

And she says, oh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now

She tried her best and now she can't win it

Somewhere in between this moment and the end
Will we bend?
Or will we open up and take this whole thing in?

Maybe you and me got lost somewhere,

But still that mocking bird wont sing
Well man this life seems hard enough
Well maybe we ain't meant for this love

And I will lead you through the broken promise land
Yes I can, ah yes I can
I can be there when you need it,
I'll give it all till you can't feel it anymore

I know everything could fall apart

Don't know when we became who we are

Better not look down

And it's everything or nothing at all

Now you broke my heart, and it wasn't right

Rob Wasserman,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Where the wine did flow oh he moved so slow 
But finally one night as the wind stood still

who stands on the back of a whale howling out in the middle of the ocean.
Waves of dog emotion.
Howl on 'til you find your sailor.
Howl on 'til he carries you home.
Hear him calling for his master
a sailor lost at sea who sank inside a splash and disappeared beneath.
Zillionaire was left drowning in his sorrows riding on a whale, drifting in 
tomorrow.

Howl for yourself.
Howl out for someone to carry you home.

Never gonna be caught dead 'less they're at the end.

Ball of fire burning heat, slammed against the wall.
Never calculated this thing happening at all.

Everybody knew that he was more dead than alive.

Way out where the water is blue there's no land to be seen.

When the sun sinks in the water
stars look down and blink at the sailors standing on deck
who smoke cigarettes and think.

all crashed out you can hear that lonely dog howling out.

Demonoid phenomenon
Regulate the flux and reflux

Die alone out in the fog

Was waitin' for the band to return from the show.

The hotel detective - he was out-a-sight.

They was out to meet the boys in the band.

And we proceeded to tear that hotel down.

Called the honey of super doom

In a mirrored bikini right out of the womb
They chased each other with the steam and knives
Screaming oil is in my veins
And then she grabbed a big old pipe
And smoked up some fine old monkey brains, get on it

Now some say that one-eyed wolf
Owned midget who was almost ten feet tall
He spray-painted UFO's are real
In the rubble of the Berlin wall
So finally on that fateful day they went looking for a Superman

But all they had was jizz on the walls
And bones of a mangled priest

Look out

Now baby doll what do you say
When the spacemen comes to town
I think he's got a one-track mind
And he likes to boogie down
So in the end all she did was murder metropolis

Now I'm goin' through movies in L.A
Playin' the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up

[Chorus]
I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin' down, playa surroundin' livin' these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin' comin' Up

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is to valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks
Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin' hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin' clubs
After ""Diamonds N Yo Face"" I was coppin' dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin' us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin'
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Meclaron
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them none believers
Cause down here we poppin' trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

[Chorus]

[Pimp C]
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
I'm comin' up (choppin' on dubs and showin' 'em love)

Uh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin' up",Comin' Up

And it makes a man a thief
His life becomes a gamble

Go ask the child with cancer who eases her pain
Then go to your churches, if that's how you feel
But don't ask me to follow, for God isn't real.

Speaks to him in symbols that few understand
For a life of devotion, the death blow he deals

Go tell his shackled victim of the mercy on high...

Robbie O'Connell,"Tim Finnegan lived in watling street
A gentle Irishman, mighty odd
He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet
To rise in the world, he carried a hod

See, he'd sort of a tipplin' way
With love for the liquor poor Tim was born
To help him on with his work each day
He'd a drop of the craythur every morn'

Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

One morning Tim got rather full
His head felt heavy which made him shake
Fell from a ladder and he broke his skull
They carried him home, his corpse to wake

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laid him out upon the bed
A gallon of whiskey at his feet
And a bottle of porter at his head

Whack fol, de, dah
Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

His friends assembled at the wake
And misses Finnegan called for lunch
First she brought in tea and cake
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch

Biddy O'Brien began to cry
Such a nice clean corpse, did you ever see?
Tim mavourneen, why did you die?
Arrah, hold your gob, said Patty Megee

Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun

Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job
""Arrah"", biddy says, she ye're wrong, I'm sure
Biddy then gave her a belt on the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor

When a bottle of whiskey flew at him

Robbie O'Connell,"One pleasant evening in the month of June
As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was ""The Jug Of Punch""

What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

And if I get drunk, well the money's me own
And them that don't like me, they can leave me alone
I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow
And I'll be welcome wherever I go",Jug of Punch

I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all",Parting Glass
Robbie O'Connell,"There was a wild colonial boy, Jack Duggan was his name
He was born and raised in Ireland in a place called Castlemaine
He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
And dearly did his parents love the wild colonial boy

At the early age of sixteen years, he left his native home
And to Australia's sunny shore he was inclined to roam
He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he shot James McAvoy
A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy

One morning on the prairie as Jack he rode along
A listening to the mockingbird a singing a cheerful song
Out stepped a band of troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
They all set out to capture him, the wild colonial boy

""Surrender now Jack Duggan for you see we're three to one
Surrender in the Queen's high name for you're a plundering son""
Jack pulled two pistols from his belt and he proudly waved them high
""I'll fight, but not surrender,"" said the wild colonial boy

He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
And turning 'round to Davis, he received a fatal wound
A bullet pierced his proud young heart from the pistol of Fitzroy
And that was how they captured him, the wild colonial boy",Wild Colonial Boy

Robbie Robertson,"Yeah, I can see it now
The distant red neon shivered in the heat
I was feeling like a stranger in a strange land
You know where people play games with the night
God, it was too hot to sleep
I followed the sound of a jukebox coming from up the levee
All of a sudden I could hear somebody whistling
Fromright behind me
I turned around and she said
""Why do you always end up down at Nick's Cafe?""
I said ""I don't know, the wind just kind of pushed me this way.""
She said ""Hang the rich.""

  Somewhere down the crazy river

Take a picture of this
The fields are empty, abandoned '59 Chevy
Laying in the back seat listening to Little Willie John
Yea, that's when time stood still
You know, I think I'm gonna go down to Madam X
And let her read my mind
She said ""That Voodoo stuff don't do nothing for me.""

I'm a man with a clear destination
I'm a man with a broad imagination
You fog the mind, you stir the soul
I can't find, ... no control

To places never been before
Look for me
Somewhere down the crazy river

Catch the blue train
All the way to Kokomo

Wait, did you hear that
Oh this is sure stirring up some ghosts for me
She said ""There's one thing you've got to learn
Is not to be afraid of it.""
I said ""No, I like it, I like it, it's good.""
She said ""You like it now
But you'll learn to love it later.""

Robbie Robertson,"Sonny got caught in the moonlight
A wanted man with a haunted heart
Sonny found out the hard way

Playing for keeps, loser weeps
He said he'd come back when the lion sleeps

Struck by lightning, the fire is dying
And she called out your name
Sudden thunder, the sky is crying
Can't tell the tears from the rain

Sonny got caught in the moonlight
Paint graffiti on the subway wall
Sonny got lost in the blue night
They stood like statues, legs spread wide
Catch him in the crossfire and take him by surprise

Struck by lightning, the fire is dying
And she called out your name
Sudden thunder, the sky is crying
Can't tell the tears from the rain

Paint a portrait of a fool
With my heart in my hands
They've come to take me down

By the power that can turn the tide
I heard three shots around midnight

Driven by the passion, running from the heat

Took to the road with a carnival show (roll on)

In these shoes, I've walked a crooked mile
All my life I been searching for the nightbird

Are you ready to blow the steam

Robbie Robertson,"I tried to reach you
On Valentine's Day
But how can I reach you
When you're so far away

Don't make me a victim
Don't make me the clown
With my arms reaching out
And my head hanging down

We can't go on
Touching the flame
Breakin the rules
Of the game

I bring you this cross
I carved out of wood
I'm just trying to tell you
That I'd change if I could

Grew up on the west side
Never even been to the east side
Don't know what they do with their lives
Over there over there

We can't go on
Hiding the pain
Breakin the rules
Of the game

We can't go on
Living in shame
Breakin the rules
Of the game

",Breakin' the Rules
Robbie Robertson,"In this dusty little railroad town
Smack in the heart of the bible belt
Where nothing ever changes
While nothing remains the same
When first I saw the raven
Lean against the wind
I said who's the girl
With the tattoo on her skin
I followed her home
She lives down by the water
My friend Teddy told me
She's the Frenchman's daughter

On this day of reckoning
I'm riding shotgun with you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

When I come knocking on her front door
The neighbour said she don't live there no more
Well she moved from the country
Down to the city
Where the scene was dark
And the street was gritty
In the hustle and bustle and all the commotion
She got addicted to the locomotion

On this day of reckoning
By the old wooden bridge
I wait for you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

I remember the smell of the burning leaves
And we were making love
She was like a young Georgia O'Keefe
From another time
In an old abandoned railroad shack
On should never go
Where anything can happen
When the zephyr blows

On this day of reckoning
I'm calling to you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

The phone rings she said
I can't tell you where I'm calling from
Cause my papa's on the lam
For something shady that he's done
There hangs a tale of love
For the first time
For the first time

And we may break the rules but we don't break the law
Come across but the river's too wide
I'd come across but the river's too high
And over by the fountain where we meet
I will lay silver roses at your feet

Won't you raise up your hand

Old and hanging in a frame
And that painting was of you
Now how can you explain
From another place in time
Done many years ago
Why I'm haunted by this vision
Guess we'll never know

Can you feel my heartbeat

The horses were thirsty and tired
On the trail of a renegade chief
One he'd come to admire
The soldiers hid behind the hills
That surrounded the village
And he rode down to warn the chief
They'd come to conquer and pillage
Lay down your arms
Lay down your spear
The chief's eyes were sad
But showed no sign of fear

It is a good day to die
Oh my children dry your eyes
It is a good day to die

With his guns and whisky
He told of a time a long time ago
Before what you call history
The general couldn't believe his words
Nor the look on his face
But he knew these people would rather die
Then have to live in this disgrace
What law have I broken
What wrong have I done
That makes you want to bury me
Upon this trail of blood

[Chorus:]

We cared for the land and the land cared for us
And that's the way it's always been
Never asked for more never asked too much
And now you tell me this is the end
I laid down my weapon
Laid down my bow

Robbie Robertson,"Perhaps you think the Creator sent you here to dispose of us as you see fit
If I thought you were sent by the creator
I might be induced to think you had a right to dispose of me
Do not misunderstand me
But understand me fully with reference to my affection for the land
I never said the land was mine to do with as I choose
The one who has a right to dispose of it is the one who has created it

I claim a right to live on my land
And accord you the privilege to return to yours
Brother we have listened to your talk
Coming from our father the great White Chief at Washington
And my people have called upon me to reply to you
And in the winds which pass through these aged pines
We hear the moanings of their departed ghosts

And if the voice of our people could have been heard
That act would never have been done
But alas though they stood around they could neither be seen or heard
Their tears fell like drops of rain
I hear my voice in the depths of the forest
But no answering voice comes back to me
All is silent around me
My words must therefore be few
I can now say no more

He received a vision so inspired
Three messengers with painted faces appeared

On the Allegheny river at a place called Burnt House
The code was shared for the very first time
By a Seneca chief, they call Handsome Lake

And show the Six Nations the code was still alive

Robbie Robertson,"You know we have a million stories to tell
I'm just one of a million or more stories that could be told

Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

My name is Leonard Peltier
I am a Lakota and Anishnabe
And I am living in the United States penitentiary
Which is the swiftest growing
Indian reservations in the country

I have been in prison since 1976
For an incident that took place on the Oglala-Lakota Nation
There was a shoot-out between members of the American Indian Movement
And The F-B-I and the local Sheriffs State Troopers
Two agents were killed and one Indian was murdered

Three of us were charged with the deaths of the F-B-I agents
My co-defendants were found not-guilty by reasons of self-defense
My case was separated and I was found guilty before a jury of non-Indian people
The prosecutor stated that they did not know who killed their agents
Nor did he know what participation Leonard Peltier may have played in it
But someone has to pay for the crime

There's a lot of nights that I lay in my cell
And I can't understand why this hell this hell and this terror
That I have been going through for twenty-one years hasn't ended

Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay sacrifice
To make things better for our people
The sacrifice I have made when I really sit down to think about it
Is nothing compared to what our people a couple hundred years ago
Or fifty years ago or twenty-five years ago have made
Some gave their lives
Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arms
So the sacrifice I have made is nothing compared to those

I've gone too far now to start backing down
I don't give up
Not 'til my people are free will I give up
And if I have to sacrifice some more
Then I sacrifice some more",Sacrifice

When you find what's worth keeping
With a breath of kindness
Blow the rest away.

And pointed me out
She said Hallelu Hallelu

We had dreams when the night was young
We were believers when the night was young
We could change the world stop the war
Never seen nothing like this before
But that was back when the night was young

Sign reads God Bless America guns and ammo
I'm not sure that's what He means
Sign reads repent the end is near
I'm not sure that's what we need

We could change the world stop the war

Was it lost in the mail
Then tell me why
There's no reply

Where can she be tonight
As I lay here in the dark
And I reach for you
I long for you

But you've gone
Like the wind
And I know
That you won't be back again

Pictures of days gone by
That you painted as a child
You gave to me
You saved for me

Where does she sleep tonight
Is she underneath a star
The healing grace
The secret place

That you've gone
Like the wind
And I know
That you won't be back again

Look down from your ivory tower
That's me standing in the mist
And I tried to hide
My broken pride

I stumbled my way here, but wait, oh wait
Grace has found me, shaken up my soul
Grace will follow where ever you will go
Listen to me now Grace
Oh Grace, is calling for you just to say

Here come better days
Here come better days
Better days and a better place
I know

Green grass and I'm laying in the sunlight of you
The wind is moving through the trees blustering you
And the better days you bring, the better places found
Feasting at your table I'm overwhelmed

And I lift my glass drink to those who never gave up
Clouds pass fading into memories gone
And all I know for life is life and love and peace
What else could there be?

Weak and wounded sick and sore
Jesus ready stands to save you
Full of pity, love and power

Come ye thirsty come and welcome
God's free bounty glorify
True belief and true repentance
And every grace that brings you nigh

I will arise and go to Jesus
He will embrace me in His arms
And in the arms of my dear Savior
There are ten thousand charms

Come ye weary heavy laden
Lost and ruined by the fall
If you tarry until you're better
You will never come at all

To the crimson perpetual tide
Kneel down on the shore, be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

Cleanse your heart and your soul in the fountain that flows
For you and me and for all

At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous night, you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On a beautiful scandalous night

On the hillside you will be delivered
At the foot of the cross justified
And your spirit restored by the river that pours
From our blessed Savior's side

At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree
On a beautiful scandalous night, you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white

To keep you warm and dry

On which the paint won't dry

A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules

No one can shoot but everybody's scoring
Trust me it's boring get down and pray

There's dust on your needle and you think that
You're a rebel

You're Evel Knievel so get down and pray

He makes you all laugh so she's the one
Doing harm

The one under his arm

These dreams have let you down
Take it don't break it just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down

You never stopped loving his misfortunate
Lazy ways
All the memories that you should've had
Are a cabaret haze
There's just a hole where you know he
Should've been
There's no one worse off than you
When you can't describe what you've seen

These dreams have let you down
Take it don't break it just it turn around
These dreams won't let you down

Where do you go when you're all alone
In your bed
Do you cry in your sleep cos it's
Better unsaid
Have you forgotten your past because
That's how it seems
Is it too hard to think so you edit
Your dreams
And play them back again and again

These dreams have let you down
Take it don't break it just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down

Ask me when, (ta ra ra ra)
I say it started when I met you (ta ra ra ra ra ra)
And ever since then I knew that the past couldn't last
For right now, I think I'm running
A race that I know I'm gonna win
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing

If people say I'm crazy, I tell 'em that it's true
Let them watch with amazement
Say it won't last beyond breakfast
It's a phase he's going through
Denigrate or speculate on what I'm going through
Because it isn't the sort of thing I would normally do

Ask me what, (ta ra ra ra)
I say I think it's good for you (ta ra ra ra ra)
Believe it or not, I know where it's all leading to
I feel like taking all my clothes off

She breathes flesh to my bones

Robbie Williams,"Tell me a story
Where we all change
And we'd live our lives together
And not estranged

I didn't lose my mind it was
Mine to give away
Couldn't stay to watch me cry
You didn't have the time
So I softly slip away

No regrets they don't work
No regrets they only hurt
Sing me a love song
Drop me a line
Suppose it's just a point of view
But they tell me I'm doing fine

I know from the outside
We looked good for each other
Felt things were going wrong
When you didn't like my mother

I don't want to hate but that's
All you've left me with
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy of
How we all could live

No regrets they don't work
No regrets they only hurt
(We've been told you stay up late)
I know they're still talking
(You're far too short to carry weight)
The demons in your head
(Return the videos they're late)
If I could just stop hating you
(Goodbye)
I'd feel sorry for us instead

Remember the photographs (insane)
The ones where we all laugh (so lame)
We were having the time of our lives
Well thank you it was a real blast

No regrets they don't work
No regrets they only hurt
Write me a love song
Drop me a line
Suppose it's just a point of view
But they tell me I'm doing fine

Everything I wanted to be every
Time I walked away
Every time you told me to leave
I just wanted to stay
Every time you looked at me and 
Every time you smiled
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child
I loved the way we used to laugh
I loved the way we used to smile
Often I sit down and think of you
For a while
Then it passes by me and I think of
Someone else instead
I guess the love we once had is

I met her father she met my mother
We didn't have anywhere else to go
She said to me when we grow older
Will we still need young love on
Our shoulders
Does it just fade away
Will we ever know?

She touched my face and called me
Her lover
I never thought that I'd need another

Your cool suburban sun
You're foolin' everyone
You win some, you lose some

I didn't know what we had found
Just caught the bus and rode it to town
She wouldn't notice anything else but me

Dancing at discos
And moaning at phone bills
Torremolinos and sun burnt in high heels
Swap it and sell it
And drop it and smell it

Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup,
Wash it off
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind me now

Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it

Unaware but underlined I figured out the story
It wasn't good
And in the corner of a mind I celebrated glory
But it wasn't to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me

So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Do you know how much is hurts?
I didn't die overnight
In the wind I had candlelight
I'm controlled by my fear
All the voices in my head
That I can hear

Please don't hurt me

How do I learn
To give and love and be loved in return
If this is heaven I'm falling
I'd rather run and jump away
Than to see it burn
I feel I could die
Before I sleep I kiss your cheek
And say goodbye

I'm so sorry
Please don't hurt me

This is love calling earth
Do you know how much it hurts?

What a lovely holiday
There's nothing funny left to say

This somber song would drain the sun
But it won't shine until it's sung

No water running in the stream
The saddest place we've ever been

Everything I touched was golden
Everything I loved got broken
On the road to Mandalay
Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way

There's nothing left for you to give
The truth is all that you're left with
Twenty paces then at dawn
We will die and be reborn

I like to sleep beneath the trees
Have the universe at one with me
Look down the barrel of a gun
And feel the moon replace the sun

Has been lost returned or broken
No more dragons left to slay

Send black mariah for blue delusions

So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words he would reveal
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way [*][Multimedia Track]

Still I'll always, always keep

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you've changed my life

You were rubbish in that
Don't start that with me on this album
Why did you do it like that, that time
For start to finish there you said I'm wrong
You said I had to think about Kylie when I was doing this and I was
You obviously weren't thinking about Kylie, 
You were thinking about June Whitfield
I can't hear you, I can't hear you
Well you were thinking about June Whitfield that's who you were thinking about.
I had to think about somebody and you told me Kylie
Well listen, you just came in wrong and then it got progressively worse from there.
You started it wrong

Robbie Williams,"You wake up in the middle of
The thunder of a scream
And you realise that it was yours
You don't know what to tell them
'Cause you don't know where you've been
And you've been late so many times before

It's only natural to feel like you're sinking
It's only human to be so unprepared

Don't worry baby
If you get a little high
It's just a phase to get you through
Getting by
So you get a little restless
And you get a little wasted
It's just a little light entertainment
Embrace it
It might just save your life

You always say you're sorry
But you never know what for
And it's been happening more and more
Act your age and not your shoe size
And blah blah blah blah blah
That's your role model

Slammin' the door

So it's only natural to feel
The guilt of a nation
It's only human when your young
You're gonna cry

Don't worry baby
If you get a little high
It's just a phase to get you through
Getting by
So you get a little restless
And you get a little wasted
It's just a little light entertainment
Embrace it
It might just save your life

So where else can you go to
Cause no one's given you the book
About what to say and how to feel
And what you should and shouldn't have took
It's feelings that your fearing
That's why you step outside your mind

Don't look back
'Cause if you don't crack

You get to sing this lullaby",Get a Little High

If you lick it, then lick it
Battery good and properly, all night if you want

I haven't got a clue what to do with you
Need for you to love me so much
Jesus, what am I gonna do with this crush?
Just get the old fella and whack it up against her tush
How peculiar?

In the Dorchester you can keep your hot breath
I'm not into hard sports

Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you

God, what am I gonna do with this crush?
Just whack the the old man out and get it up against your tush

A book that no-one read
A film that never made me sad
And you remind of a place I've never been

And something no-one said
When I was 17
One fine day
In the middle of the night

You'll wake up in it
One fine day
In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it

Remember when we never struggled through?
A bad time we never had
A love we never fell into
Please don't remind me to forget

'Cause forgiveness is a place
I ain't got used to yet
One fine day
In the middle of the night

You'll wake up in it
One fine day
In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it

All I ever wanted
Was to radiate your home
But I guess it doesn't matter
So come reminisce about a time we didn't have

I hear there's a sequel to that film that never made you sad
Don't rewrite my history
'Cause you never really know
How much you didn't mean to me

In the middle of the night
You'll wake up in it
One fine day

In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it",One Fine Day
Robbie Williams,"It was me and my monkey
Him with his dungarees and Rollerblades
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft top down
He liked the wind in his face
He said ?Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said ?No' he said ?That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place'
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he said
?I left my wallet in El Segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed'

Me and monkey
With a dream and a gun
Hoping my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and monkey
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did

And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages
Called up escort services and ordered some okie doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores
?Hi, my name is Sunshine. These are my girls. Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world'
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine
What's up, you better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good time'

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and my monkey
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did

Got tickets to see Sheena Easton
The monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores
He couldn't sit still
Sheena was a blast baby
But my monkey was ill
When I played black jack
Kept hittin' 23
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey
I couldn't be sure
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
?My name is Rodriguez' he says with death in his eye
?I've been chasing you for a long time amigos
And now your monkey is gonna die'

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
We don't want to kill no Mexican
But we got ten itchy fingers
One thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare
You do not stare
You do not stare

Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
And I ain't about to run
Put your gun down boy
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow",Me and My Monkey

There's just no pleasing me 
Trying to love somebody 
Just want to love somebody right now 
Baby lay your love on me 

Violet in the rainbow just melt away 
There's not enough minutes in the hour 
Or hours in the day 
The song played in a circle that never skips a beat 
The stranger in a country that I have yet to meet 

And it's hope that springs eternal for everyone 
Got a lifetime in a second oh the damage done 

Trying to love somebody 
Just want to love somebody right now 
Guess there's just no pleasing me 
I want to love somebody 
Just want to love somebody right now 
Baby lay your love on me 

It'll come in your sweet time, Lord 
I just gotta let you in 
The blind leading the blind, Lord 
Getting underneath your skin 
I can feel you in the silence 
Saying let forever be 
Love, only love, will set you free 

I want to love somebody 
Want to love somebody right now 
There's just no pleasing me 
I want to love somebody 
Just want to love somebody right now 
Lay lay, lay your love on me

I just gotta let you in

Getting underneath your skin 
I can feel you in the silence 
Saying let forever be

Robbie Williams,"I've sung some songs that were lame 
I've slept with girls on the game
I've got my Catholic shame
Lord I'm in purgatory
Basically it's all come-on talk for me

I wasn't me when we met
You haven't lost my respect
I'm here to serve and protect
What shape of insanity
Keeps leading you back to me?

So put your hands across the water
Mushroom
Monsoon
Come soon

Don't want to piss on your parade 
I'm here to make money and get laid
Yeah I'm a star but I'll fade
If you ain't sticking your knives in me 
You will be eventually

To all you Sharons and Michelles
With all your tales to sell
Save your meat money well
I'm glad that spending a night with me
Guaranteed you celebrity.

And I can't talk in a crowd
When I'm alone I'm too loud
You're done, your daddy's proud 
Thank you for keeping me company
You've all been so nice to me

So put your hands across the water
Mushroom
Monsoon
Come soon

Oh Lord
I feel
Nothing
I know much smarter men
Never got this far

I got too many regrets 
I've smoked too many cigarettes
I've had more blondes than brunettes
I'm not expecting your sympathy
But it's all been too much for me

So put your hands across the water

Come soon",Monsoon
Robbie Williams,"You said when you died that you'd walk with me everyday
And I started to cry and said please don't talk that way
With a blink of an eye and the Lord came and asked you to leave 
You went to a better place but they stole you away from me

And now she lives in heaven
But I know they let her out
To take care of me
There's a strange kind of light
Caressing me tonight
Pray silence my fear
She is near
Bringing heaven down here

I miss your love I miss your touch
But I'm feeling you every day
And I can almost hear you say
You've come a long way baby

And now you live in heaven
But I know they let you out
To take care of me
There's a strange kind of light
In my bedroom tonight
Pray silence my fear
She is near
Bringing heaven down here

You taught me kings and queens
While stroking in my head
In my darkest hour
I know you are there
Leaning down beside me
Whispering my prayers
There's a strange kind of light
Caressing me tonight
Pray silence my fear",Nan's Song
Robbie Williams,"Don't fight the feeling, relax 
Oh child the knot's in your back 
'Cause you've been holding on 
I feel you when you're reaching out 

I'll talk you through memories 
Just keep breathing with me 
It's time to hold my hand 
And walk into the revolution 

When there's no one to touch 
And you've been thinking too much 
You only hurt yourself 
When it's all about retribution 

I see the pain in your face 
And praying rare for this space 
It's time to lead you on 
C'mon, it's a revolution 

When you can't keep on keeping on 
And everything you lean upon is all but gone 
Everybody falls sometimes 
But love shines on 
And on and on and 

With love in your eyes and a flame in your heart 
You're gonna find yourself some resolution 
A million miles with one step 
You'll find yourself yet 
Walking with the revolution

Talking about the revolution 
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution) 
Walking with the revolution 
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution) 
Taking you higher 

Old love lingers on 
You're just feelin it wrong 
I know you're tired 
But when it's time to sleep you're gone forever 

Make friends with your past 
And you can leave it at last 
It's time to find yourself 
Walking with the revolution 

And you can keep on keeping on and 
Everything you lean upon is all but gone 
Everybody hurts sometimes 
But love shines on and on and on and 

Time and tide's on your side 
There's no need to hide 
I feel your pain 
Don't talk to me about evolution 
A million miles with one step 
You'll find yourself yet 
When you're walking with the revolution 

Walking with the revolution

And you'll find yourself yet 
When you're walking with the revolution

(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution) 
Get on with your revolution

It's all about resolution now 

Talking about the revolution

Talking about the revolution

Lead you on to the revolution

Robbie Williams,"You can't manufacture a miracle
The silence was pitiful that day.
A love is getting too cynical
Passion's just physical these days
You analyze everyone you meet
But get no sign, love ain't kind
Every night you admit defeat
And cry yourself blind

[Chorus:]
If you can't wake up in the morning
Cause your bed lies vacant at night
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely
Can't control it, try as you might
May you find that love that won't leave you
May you find it by the end of the day
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely
Something beautiful will come your way

The DJ said on the radio
Life should be stereo, each day
In the past you cast the unsuitable
Instead of some kind of beautiful, you just couldn't wait
All your friends think you're satisfied
But they can't see your soul no, no, no
Forgot the time feeling petrified, when they lived alone

[Chorus

Some kind of beautiful (will come your way) [Repeat: x4]

All your friends think you're satisfied
But they can't see your soul no no no
Forgot the time feeling petrified
When they lived alone

[Chorus]",Something Beautiful

With the bouncer on the door
Sell your innocence

Since I believed in your cocaine
All that praying and wailing will leave a stain
So take your Sunday songs and shove it

Hey now, my baby, maybe now we're free
With the appliance of science
We can be anyone we want to be

They'll come bearing you
And charge the earth for it
If you're lucky they'll let you breathe
So scream as you go faster
If that's the world you're after
But make sure you're home for tea

Don't believe in clever people
Clever people drop the bomb
Don't believe your big and evil, they're aliens
So take your rocket science and shove it

Hey now, my baby, maybe now we're free
With the appliance of science
We can be anyone we want to be

I took Debbie to the crown

I feel as though all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph

I found your postcard
And I put it on the wall
I found your picture

We didn't smoke
We'd walk home from the pub

And said that you were dead
I thought she's talking of
Another Kim instead

I feel as though all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph
Of me and Kimberley

You accidentally overdosed
It was so long since I talked to her

And I am left with all these things
I didn't say
And a picture of you in my arms

Down in the wires

Knocking me down

Look for the light

If there's a freak in here 
Looking for someone like me 
I fit their description 
Perfectly 

Boom boom boom 
I bet they'll desert you 
They would if they met you 
Met you with me 

Every move you make is poetry 
They all fake what you do naturally 
If not for you 
I wouldn't come at all 

Find a place to crash 
(Boom boom, boom boom labida) 
Move your phoney ass 
(Boom boom, boom boom labida) 

Love me like I'm cash 
(Boom boom, boom boom labida) 
You can see the clash 
(Boom boom, boom boom labida) 

Kiss me with your mouth 
Teach me with your brain 
All right 

Oh yeah, oh yeah 

Things that I say 
When I say nothing at all 
It leaves a taste in my stomach 
And its no taste at all 

I can sing, I can't dance 
But it don't stop me at all 
Its a ball and I'll call , if I call you at all 

Love is the reason but it won't pay my rent 
Only baloney fill your dish in the dent 
I won't be happy till the moneys been spent 
I forget to forget, oh forget, oh forget

Robbie Williams,"Let me lie down
Please don't wake me
Nothing's sacred
And no one saved me

In my black eye
I can feel it
Moving closer
Can't you hear it

The only gift you gave to me
Was self-fulfilling prophecy
I need to change the sounds 
That shape my life

And if you die before I leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around there's no one here
To love me and hold me

Take me dancing
I love music
Keep on singing
We won't lose it

Picture me there
Missing no one
If young hearts run free
Why can't we go on

Go on 'til they kick us out
We've everything to talk about
I could bring a song into your life

If you should die before I leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around there's no one here
To love me and hold me

Maybe I've been away too long
I know I'm not always right but is that wrong
They say there's nothing I can do
But talk to strangers and wait for you

If you should die before I leave
What on earth becomes of me
Look around there's no one
To love me and hold me

For those of about to cry we love you
For those of us who live in fear
Of Happy Christmas and New Year
I raise a toast to you

And if it hurts to be so blind
Why don't you try being kind

They've decided to become
A little more proactive
Creep upon you while you sleep
And make you less attractive

Born without a spine
Why don't you try being kind

For those out drinking their mother's wake
You'll find a way to soldier on
For those whose love evaporates
I pray you find where you belong

Oh the words I have repressed
Are coming out today I guess
It's justice not respect I'm after
And that just leaves comtempt
For you all

I am just a simple man
With simple expectations
With deep regrets they're seldom met
God speed my generation

And with Crowley on my mind
I should try being kind

For those of about to cry we love you
For those about to die we salute you

Robbie Williams,"I used to live around here
I was the boy with the flash clothes
She was the girl with the acid stare
I saw her at The Place
You know she knows you know
How she shakes when she jacks her body
To the sounds of Oran Juice Jones and
Jocelyn Brown

Oh spread your wings before they fall apart
Home is where the hurt is darling
Follow your heart

So she walks into this dead end bar
Sticks her handbag on the chair
So she walks into this dead end bar
Puts hers handbag on the chair
And she weights the words we shared
When we were fifteen and still cared
'Cause she feels I'm a scar from the wound
That time can't heal

And I said
Don't let your dreams out of your head
Stick it to the man instead
Don't fool your heart lying about
The feelings that you had back then
Did you try to change your life?
Did you ever try to change your life?
You repeat and repeat
And repeat and repeat
Now what's up with that?

Now she loves somebody else
In flash clothes
She was the girl with the acid stare
And now she'd pay to have one of those

And she weighs the word she says
And she knows you exist
Now she feels
I'm the scar from the wound
That time can't heal

Oh spread your wings before they fall apart
Home is where the hurt is darling
Follow your heart

Spread your wings before they fall apart
Home is where the hurt is darling

They're being heartless,

I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you think we should suffer in silence
When a hearth is broken there's nothing to break

You've been mixing,
With some very heavy faces.
They boys have done,
A bit of bird.

They don't kill their own,
and they all love their mothers.
But you're out of your depth son,
Have a word.

I swim through cracks 
And leave with words

A better offer came through 
You see the trouble with you 
There's no trouble with you

That stops me loving you 

So she stays 
On sunset strip

I drown in it 
She's waiting for 
My words to break 
The one true love 
I couldn't make

Tell a joke, tell it twice
If no one else is laughing there, why am I?
I split myself both times and laugh until I cry
Oh Lord, please make me pure but not yet

I don't have to try, I just dial it in
I've never found a job that for me was worth bothering
I got a ton of selfish genes and lazy bones beneath this skin
Oh Lord, make me pure but not yet

Smoking kills, sex sells
I've got one hand in my pocket but the other one looks cool as hell
I know I'm gonna die, so my revenge is living well
Oh Lord, make me pure but not yet

I stopped praying so I hope this song will do
I wrote it all for you
I'm not perfect but you don't mind that, do you?
I know you're there to pull me through, aren't you?

So I look for love, I like the search
And I'll be standing for election all across the known universe
Every president gets the country she deserves
Oh Lord, make me pure but not yet

Robbie Williams,"There's no earthly way of knowing
What was in your heart when it stopped going
The whole world shook
A storm was blowing through you

Waiting for God to stop this
And up to your neck in darkness
Everyone around you was corrupted
Say something

There's no dignity in death
To sell the world your last breath
We're still fighting
Over everything you left

I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

Through your eyes the world was burning
""Please be gentle, I'm still learning""
You seemed to say as you kept turning up

They poisoned you with compromise
But at what point did you realize
Everybody loves your life but you?

A special agent for the man
Through Watergate and Vietnam
No one really gave a damn
Do you think the C.I.A. did?

I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case

No one learned from your mistakes

Robbie Williams,"It was me and my monkey
Him with his dungarees and roller blades
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft top down 
He liked the wind in his face
He said ""Son, you ever been to Vegas?' 
I said ""No"" he said ""That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place""
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he said 
""I left my wallet in El Segundo"" and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel 
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
""If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed""

Me and monkey 
With a dream and a gun
Hoping my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and monkey 
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did

And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages 
Called up escort services and ordered some oki doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores 
""Hi, my name is Sunshine. 
These are my girls. 
Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world""
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine 
""What's up?""
""You better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good time""

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone 
Me and my monkey 
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did

Got tickets to see Sheena Easton
The monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores
He couldn't sit still 
Sheena was a blast baby
But my monkey was ill
When I played black jack 
Kept hittin' 23
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey
I couldn't be sure
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before 
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run 
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
""My name is Rodriguez"" he says with death in his eye
""I've been chasing you for a long time amigos
And now your monkey is gonna die""

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
We don't want to kill no Mexican 
But we got ten itchy fingers 
One thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare 
You do not stare
You do not stare

Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
And I ain't about to run

And when I'm drunk I dance like me Dad
I've started to dress a bit like him
Early morning when I wake up

I look like Kiss but without the make up
And that's a good line to take it to The bridge
And you know and you know
'Cause my life's a mess

And I'm trying to grow so before

You think that I'm strong you're wrong

Caught a plane and flew away
And all the best women are married
All the handsome men are gay

Is there a tumour in your humour,
Are there bags under your eyes?
Do you leave dents where you sit,
Are you getting on a bit?
Will you survive
You must survive

This new century keeps bringing you down

Another partner in your life to
abuse and to adore?
Is it lovey dovey stuff,
Do you need a bit of rough?
Get on your knees

Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment
That echoes in your ear
Saying love will stop the pain
Saying love will kill the fear

This new century keeps bringing you down

Something beginning with (ah)
Got my back up
And now she's screaming
So I've got to turn the track up
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up
I know this girl she likes to switch teams

Robbie Williams,"I smoked Consulates and Park Drive, drank Nookie Brown
Learned how to skive
Polo mints to hide my breath from my mum
Did a little weed cause it felt like fun
Did a little bit of speed if my friend had some
Nicked Volkswagen badges I'm a Beastie Boys son
Me so horny, me so young and I still get my washing done
Auntie Joe died of cancer God didn't have an answer
Rhythm was a dancer
Any room for a chancer? That's me in the corner, thanks sir!
I wore a troop track suit, British Knights shoes, Kangol hat like LL Cool's
Before I was 'avin it, 'avin it large
They nicked the BMX from out my garage
Knew it was Tier from off the estate cuz every time he'd see me, he'd smile like we were mates
From then on in I'd have to walk to me Nan's
And I'd dream my dreams through a sea of prams
Like a hooligan on the football stands
And I'd throw the v's to Leeds and West Ham
Then I ran, I ran so far away down Scotia Road to a taxi bay
Then I ran again cuz I couldn't pay, a Muslim didn't get his fare that day
I apologize today

Things are better when they start
That's how the 80s broke my heart

And who are you calling poof? You like Wham, man, I hate that stuff
And then my grandad died and left a hole in the family and lots of women had to nanny me
School was a laugh, they didn't have ADD, thick was the term they used for me
(over and over)
Repeatedly
(over and over)

Take my breath away take my breath away
Bidly bidly bidly bong
Pass it on the left hand side, right turn, Clyde

That girl in the fourth year, got pregnant and she was raised Catholic, brilliant!
I cried, she cried, we cried, her youth died
Drank cider in the cemetery
The year above us had discovered E and I said it weren't for me
?12.50? I could rob me mum's purse and buy one off chalcky
Met a girl on Monday, drank fizzy pop on Tuesday
Fingered her on Wednesday and on Thursday and Friday and on Saturday
Dumped by Sunday

Things are better when they start
That's how the 80s broke my heart
The wonder years, I've played my part
That's how the 80s broke my heart

Like I said, I lost my virginity to a girl called Anne-Marie, well she said she fancied me
And then she said ""fuck me"" and I thought 'fuck me, I'm all talk and it'll be over too quickly'
And it was but I couldn't care less, I'd seen a girl's part,made a mess on her dress, oh yes!
You're now rocking with the best, second person in my year that had seen a breast
I'm in my 30s now and I'm still impressed
Where are the Falklands mum? And what have they done?
Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from?

It's the 80s, what you looking at, ya mong?
So young, so long, so young, so long
Too short, so long
What you looking at ya mong?
Too short, so long, too short, so long
So long.",The 80's
Robbie Williams,"Picking up the story from where I left off, it's 1990 now so school can fuck off
I got no GCSEs, nothing higher than a D,
I couldn't tell me mum because she'd batter me
Me and Tate sat on the bowling green, life is a shitter
We had five quid between us and bought six cans of bitter
I took me ten Benson home and I smoked through the sorrow
If I could just avoid me mum maybe I'll tell her tomorrow
I stumbled through the door and said ""Mum, it's like this.""
She said ""That man's been on the phone and you've made the list!
You're in that boy band, son, come and giz a kiss!""
Phoned up Martin and Rich and carried on getting pissed
""Boys I don't believe it, I'm gonna be famous!
Pick you up in a Porsche and buy you lots of trainers.""
I met the other guys, one seemed like a cock
I think it's gonna be like New Kids on The Block

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)

I adopted four brothers, some I liked more than others
One was like a brother from another mother
But the lead singer made it hard to like him
But I still loved him, to spite him
The first three months, you know, I nearly quit
I played snooker with me dad he said ""Don't be a dick!
Unload the bullets, your mind is a gun,
You're gonna shoot yourself when they're number one!""

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)

Now it's dinner with Versace, lunch with Princess Diana
And I'm gonna get battered if I go out in my manor
Because as much as we were loved we were also hated
The boys got jealous cause the girls got plated
Now we're famous and that, and we're dancing and that
And I'm thinking ""I can sing, Why am I stood at the back?""
So fuck the band give me Sambuca and gak
We're all a bag of nerves and not a band of brothers

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)

And now it's breaking my heart because the dream's turned to shit
It ain't broke but I'll break it in a little bit
And I'm always in trouble but I've stopped saying sorry
Everybody's worried ""What the fuck's wrong with Robbie?
He's not answering his phone, he's not talking to me
I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury.""
And now I'm running away from everything that I've been
And I'm pissed and I'm fucked and I'm only nineteen
I can't conform no more, I can't perform no more
But the boys know I'm fucked and so they show me the door
And if truth be told I wasn't fit enough to stay
So I put my head down and walked away.

That was the 90s; 90 to 95

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby

Across before she walked away

Too scared for what he had to say

Remember me?
Now should we part
Or stay awhile?
As if we were still lovers""

She took a moment just to recognise the man she'd known so well before
And as he started to apologise
Lose any bitterness she bore
She gently put her finger on his lips
To let him know she understood
And with her suitcase standing on the floor
Embraced him like a lover would

He told louise
""You look so good
It's just you see
You make me feel
As if we were still lovers""

It's not always true that time heals all wounds
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal
The memories of something really good
Something truly real, that you never found again

As if we were still lovers

And though they talked just for just a little time
Before she said she had to go
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign
That told him all he had to know

And so Louise
Waved from the bus
And as she left
She gave that smile
As if they were still lovers

It's not always true that time heals all wounds
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal
The memories of something really good
Something truly real, that I've never found again",Louise

Suburbia's a slipstream
To a memory
Of a time when you were
Close to me
I pretend
I'm there again
I close my eyes and see you
Better than before
Then I feel you touch me
And it's 1984
I know what you will say
Before you start
In my heart

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Every thought's a fashion
Or a crime
And every boy is just
A waste of time
But I pretend
It was different then
Maybe it's a habit
Maybe it's a sin
But I find out
When I try it on
It crawls beneath my skin
Once it gets inside me
It won't go
Now I know

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Rent
Shopping
Being boring
It's alright
It's a sin
I'm not scared
In denial
I want a dog
I want a lover
Can you forgive her?
Do I have to?
What have I? What have I?
What have I done to deserve this?

Just another humanoid reaction to the voices in this town
Every Saturday at the plaza guess the gender unless you'd rather,
He is a lesbian but that's ok she is the center of attention for another day
In the universe we are magenta you can join us if you enter,
Because you're different and you are strange in your own way you're just the same

Time isn't lost where devotion is I never wasted a life,
Space is the place where the soul is far from the safe and the norm
In the off stream they call it cavarade but they'll say that won't they,
I want it different I like it strange in my own way I haven't changed
It's insulting to be mislead by the hairdo of a god head
They show reverence but that's OK we are the center of the universe anyway

Robbie Williams,"How do you rate the morning sun
After a long and sleepless night?
How many stars would you give to the moon?
Do you see those stars from where you are?
Shine on the lost and loneliest
The ones who can't get over it

You always wanted more than life
But now you don't have the appetite
In a message to the troubadour
The world don't love you anymore
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun?

Stuck inside the rainbow years
You could happen to me
Cause I've been close to where you are
I've drove to places you have seen
It all seems so familiar
Like they've been sent to kill ya

It doesn't take an astronaut
To float in a space is just a thought
The morning brings a mystery
The evening makes it history
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun?

And the village drunk
Sadly passed away,
It was a shame I never knew his name
I wonder if he sat there every morning

Watched the sunrise

How do you rate the morning sun
It's just too heavy for me
And all I wanted was the world
If you were the star let in the sun
Don't go wasting your time

Till I get to say sorry
I get hysterical, historicals, of love it's just chemical
Give us something to stop me
Only you

Since you went away, my heart breaks everyday
You don't know 'cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make all modern feelings fade away
Only you
Know me

I'm doin' fine and the sun often shines
What are you thinking?
I done bruised up my mind with this thunderbird wine

I pray for my sanity
Where we don't have to answer to anyone 'bout anything

This is not like a brochure
Flying cars and sex machines
We are all so compliant
'Cause everything is what it seems
And it can't be the satellite
To tell you how loved you are
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

You've been bending so long now
You think it's standing up
And they line up behind you to build you up, buttercup
We can lose all meaning
Quicker than a credit card
And not everyone's healing, so try your best and don't love too hard
Cause they can't build a satellite
To tell you what's in your heart
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

Will I ever feel the waking
Naked as a lullaby
Don't ask me to explain again
I can't lie to my heart and I

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

Robbie Williams,"Well there’s three versions of this story mine and yours
And then the truth
Now we can put it down to circumstance, our childhood, then our youth
Out of some sentimental gain I wanted you to feel my pain,
But it came back return to sender
I read your mind and tried to call,
My tears could fill the Albert Hall,
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

What a shame we never listened
I told you through the television
And all that went away was the price we paid
People spend a lifetime this way
Oh what a shame.

So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus, oh
And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us
I wrote a letter in my mind,
But the words were so unkind,
About a man I can’t remember
I don’t recall the reasons why,
I must have meant them at the time
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

What a shame we never listened
I told you through the television
And all that went away was the price we paid
People spend a lifetime this way
And that’s how they stay
Oh what a shame.

Words come easy
When they’re true
Words come easy
When they’re true

So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus
And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us
Now we can put it down to circumstance, our childhood then our youth.

No water running in the stream
The saddest place we've ever been

Everything I touched was golden
Everything I loved got broken
On the road to Mandalay

Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way

There's nothing left for you to give
The truth is all that you're left with
Twenty paces then at dawn
We will die and be reborn

I like to sleep beneath the trees
Have the universe at one with me
Look down the barrel of a gun
And feel the moon replace the sun

Has been lost returned or broken
No more dragons left to slay
Every mistake I've ever made

And for years I've thought just sing along

The tune that's true lives on and on

Never cries, never open her eyes

Robbie Williams,"I was there to witness
Candice's inner business
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows, and her ponies
She was educated
But could not count to ten
How she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men
And I say

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high
But in the hole there's water
You can get some, when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she's made of candy

Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high
But in the hole there's water
As you win
She'll be the Hollywood love
And if it don't feel good
What are you doing this for
Now tell me

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she's made of candy

Liberate your sons and daughters

But in the hole there's water

She'll be the Hollywood love

What are you doing it for
What are you doing it for
What are you doing it for
What are you doing it for
What are you doing it for
What are you doing it for
What are you doing it for

Robbie Williams,"We became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

At last, we meet on no man's land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man's land, at last

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:

Not in the eyes, no not in his eyes anymore
His eyes

But the heart has chosen

All that I want
Is to pick you up and out of that dress
Carry it to the depths
And feel the sin of your flesh
It’s all that I want

Arching your back with that look on your face
All that need’s an hour and space
When did it change?
I guess when we started sweeping on the carpet

I’ll talk you to sleep
And no one will know

Something deep inside me dies,
'Cause I know you won't get better, better, better
You'd rather be right done with love,
The only thing I understood
Nothing's ever good enough.

I stumble through the words as they're leaving me,
Tremble at the side of Your Majesty,
And I cut myself just to get them out.

This time I'll be different, I promise you,
This time I'll be special, you know I will,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes.
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

You took my youth, you took my health,
And if you're not here I find myself
You're supposed to make this better, better, better
No self-control and no reason why,
If I don't change, then we both die,
This is it for you and I.

Blisters at the end of my fingertips,
Praying to a god I don't think exist
Will you listen now?
Can you forgive me somehow?

This time I'll be different, I promise you,
This time I'll be special, you know I will,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes.
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

Closer now to the end,
If love was the answer,
Then hope was the question
Closer now, let's pretend
We've never been out here before.

This time I'll be different, I promise you,
This time I'll be special, you know I will,
don't leave with me in your eyes.

Welcome to the zoo.

Except for one or two.

Some of them are mean.
Most of them are twisted.
Few of them are clean.

Just keep it simple.
You don't have to kiss though.
Don't waste time whit the idiots
Think that they're heroes.
They will betray you.
Stick with us weirdos.

I'm gonna be there,
I'm gonna be there, yes I will.
Go gentle through your life.
If you want me I'll be there.
When you need me I'll be there for you.

Don't try to make them love you.
Don't answer every call.
Baby be a giant.
Let the world be small.
Some of them are deadly.
Some don't let it show.
If they try and hurt you.
Just let your daddy know.

Now when you go
Giving your heart make sure they deserve it.
If they haven't earned it.
Keep searching, it's worth it.

For all your days and nights (days and night)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there, yes I will.

Looking at you
Let me melt a while in your company
I unwind in your rapture
I'm an overture to your symphony

Time makes time
A memory between us
Am I still impossible to read?

While the whole world was looking at you
You came and wrapped yourself around me

You feel the sun
A work in progress
I'm so far away from where I wanna be
You stole my heart
But my madness
Is taking the man right out of me

You said, we could have been so good together
I complicate so easily

While the whole world was looking at you
You wrapped yourself around me

So wonderful
Feeling so vulnerable
You'll never know what you did to me
Can't disguise
I'm hiding behind my eyes
You could've meant the whole world to me",Snowblind

Is it lovey dovey stuff
Do you need a bit of rough?

Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment

Saying love will kill the fear

Repeat the greatest lie till they believe it
You and me, not Gods, define us now

Raise a glass to the disfunctional

If I could just get out the way

But she doesn't have a lot to say

Robby Krieger,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;  
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach on out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you.
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through.
I'll be there to always see you through.
 
When you feel lost and about to give up 
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold, 
And you're drifting out all on your own, 
And you need a hand to hold:
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need, 
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me.",Reach Out (I'll Be There)
Robby Young,"Hey, Girl! I want you to know,
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go.
And, Hey, Girl! I tell you  no lie,
Something deep inside of me's going to die,
if you say so long, if this is goodbye. Oh!

Hey, Girl! This can't be true,
How am I supposed to exist without you?
And, Hey, Girl! Now don't put me on,
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone.
How will I live. How can I go on.
How can I go on? Hey, Girl!

Hey, Girl! Now sit yourself down,

Don't go away. Hey, Girl!
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!",Hey Girl

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't

Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

So many nights like this

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

"Robert ""Bootsie"" Barnes","Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me

There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say

Robert & Johnny,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You
Robert Bachner,"Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

Listen to the lullaby 
Of old Broadway",Lullaby of Broadway
Robert Balzar,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune

Robert Berry,"Well c'mon everybody 
And let's get together tonight 
I got some money in my jeans 
And I'm really gonna spend it right 
Been a-doin' my homework all week long 
now the house is empty the folks are gone 
C'mon everybody
Well my baby's number one 
But I'm gonna dance with three or four 
And the house'll be shakin' 
From my bare feet slapping the floor 
When you hear that music you can't sit still 
If your brother won't rock then your sister will 
C'mon everybody 

Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside 
If the folks come home I'm afraid they gonna have my hide 
There'll be no more movies for a week or two 
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew 
Who cares C'mon everybody

Robert Berry,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came

From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby
