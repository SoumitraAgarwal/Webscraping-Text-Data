Julie Andrews,"I feel pretty,
Oh, so pretty,
I feel pretty and witty and bright!
And I pity
Any girl who isn't me tonight.

I feel charming,
Oh, so charming
It's alarming how charming I feel!
And so pretty
That I hardly can believe I'm real.

See the pretty girl in that mirror there:
Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty face,
Such a pretty dress,
Such a pretty smile,
Such a pretty me!

I feel stunning
And entrancing,
Feel like running and dancing for joy,
For I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy!

Have you met my good friend Maria,
The craziest girl on the block?
You'll know her the minute you see her,
She's the one who is in an advanced state of shock.

She thinks she's in love.
She thinks she's in Spain.
She isn't in love,
She's merely insane.

It must be the heat
Or some rare disease,
Or too much to eat
Or maybe it's fleas.

Keep away from her,
Send for Chino!
This is not the
Maria we know!

Modest and pure,
Polite and refined,
Well-bred and mature
And out of her mind!

I feel pretty,
Oh, so pretty
That the city should give me its key.
A committee
Should be organized to honor me.

La la la la . . .

I feel dizzy,
I feel sunny,
I feel fizzy and funny and fine,
And so pretty,
Miss America can just resign!

La la la la 

See the pretty girl in that mirror there:

What mirror where?

Who can that attractive girl be?

Which? What? Where? Whom?

Such a pretty face,
Such a pretty dress,
Such a pretty smile,
Such a pretty me!

Such a pretty me!

I feel stunning
And entrancing,
Feel like running and dancing for joy,
For I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy!",I Feel Pretty
Julie Andrews,"I loved you once in silence
And mis'ry was all I knew
Trying so to keep my love from showing
All the while not knowing you loved me too

Yes, loved me in lonesome silence
Your heart filled with dark despair
Thinking love would flame in you forever
And I'd never, never know the flame was there

Then one day we cast away our secret longing
The raging tide we held inside would hold no more
The silence at last was broken
We flung wide our prison door
Ev'ry joyous word of love was spoken

And now there's twice as much grief
Twice the strain for us
Twice the despair
Twice the pain for us
As we had known before

And after all had been said
Here we are, my love
Silent once more
And not far, my love
From where we were before

",I Loved You Once in Silence
Julie Andrews,"I'll follow my secret heart
My whole life through
I'll keep all my dreams apart
Till one comes true
No matter what price is paid
What stars may fade above
I'll follow my secret heart
Till I find love

I'll keep all my dreams apart
Till one comes true
No matter what price is paid
What stars may fade above
I'll follow my secret heart
Till I find love",I'll Follow My Secret Heart
Julie Andrews,"Tra la, it's May, the lusty Month of May
That lovely month when everyone goes blissfully astray
Tra la, it's here, that shocking time of year
When tons of wicked little thoughts merrily appear

It's May, It's May, that gorgeous holiday
When every maiden prays that her lad will be a cad
It's mad, it's gay, alive, a lust display
Those dreary vows that everyone takes, everyone breaks
Everyone makes divine mistakes
The Lusty Month of May

Whence this fragrance wafting through the air?
What sweet feelings does it's scent transmute?
Whence this perfume floating everywhere?
Don't you know, it's that dear forbidden fruit

It's May, the lusty month of May
That darling month when everyone throws self-control away
It's time to do a wretched thing or two
And try to make each precious day one you'll always rue

It's May, it's May, the month of ""Yes, you may""
The time for every frivolous whim, proper or im-
It's wild, it's gay, depraved in every way
The birds and bees with all of their vast amorous past
Gaze at the human race aghast

Julie Andrews,"I wonder as I wander out under the sky, 
How Jesus the Savior did come for to die. 
For poor on'ry people like you and like I... 
I wonder as I wander out under the sky. 

When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall, 
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all. 
But high from God's heaven a star's light did fall, 
And the promise of ages it then did recall. 

If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing, 
A star in the sky, or a bird on the wing, 
Or all of God's angels in heaven for to sing, 
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King.",I Wonder as I Wander
Julie Andrews,"Oh, come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

God of God
Light of light
Lo, he abhors
Not the virgin's womb
Very God
Begotten not created
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord

See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks
Draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither bend
Our joyful footsteps
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus
To thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord",Oh Come All Ye Faithful
Julie Andrews,"Silent night! Holy night!
All's asleep, one sole light,
Just the faithful and holy pair,
Lovely boy-child with curly hair,
Sleep in heavenly peace!

Silent night! Holy night!
God's Son laughs, o how bright.
Love from your holy lips shines clear,
As the dawn of salvation draws near,
Jesus, Lord, with your birth!

Silent night! Holy night!
Brought the world peace tonight,
From the heavens' golden height
Shows the grace of His holy might
Jesus, as man on this earth!

Silent night! holy night!
Where today all the might
Of His fatherly love us graced
And then Jesus, as brother embraced.
All the peoples on earth!

Silent night! Holy night!
Long we hoped that He might,
As our Lord, free us of wrath,
Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

Silent night! Holy night!
Shepherds first see the sight.
Told by angelic Alleluja,
Sounding everywhere, both near and far:
""Christ the Savior is here!""","Silent Night, Holy Night"
Julie Andrews,"What child is this, who, laid to rest, 
On Mary's lap is sleeping? 
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, 
While shepherds watch are keeping? 
This, this is Christ the King, 
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing: 
Haste, haste to bring him laud, 
The babe, the son of Mary. 

Why lies he in such mean estate 
Where ox and ass are feeding? 
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here 
The silent Word is pleading. 
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through, 
The Cross be borne for me, for you; 
Hail, hail, the Word made flesh, 
The Babe, the Son of Mary. 

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh, 
Come, peasant, king, to own him. 
the King of kings salvation brings, 
Let loving hearts enthrone him. 
Raise, raise the song on high, 
The Virgin sing her lullaby: 
Joy, joy, for Christ is born, 
The Babe, the Son of Mary.",What Child Is This?
Julie Andrews,"Come and look out through the window
That big old moon is shining down
Tell me now, don't it remind you
Of the blanket on the ground 

Remember back when love first found us
And we go sleeping out of town
And we love beneath the moonlight
On the blanket on the ground 

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom 
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began 
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around 
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground 

Oh I remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We couldn't wait for night to come

Now you know you still excite me
I know you love me like I am 
Just once more I wish you'd love me
On the blanket on the ground 

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground 

Mhhm 

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around 
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground
So let's walk out in the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground.",Blanket on the Ground
Julie Andrews,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armored knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.",Out of This World
Julie Andrews,"Strange dear, but true, dear
When I'm close to you, dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love with you am I

Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you am I

In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care

So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours 'til I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you, my love, am I",So in Love
Julie Andrews,"I'm discontented with homes that are rented
So I have invented my own
Darling this place is a lover's oasis
Where life's weary chases' unknown

Far from the cry of the city
Where flowers pretty, caress the streams
Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in
Don't let it abide in my dreams

Picture me upon your knee
Just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known
That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and I'll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For you to take for all the boys to see...

We will raise a family
A girl for you and a boy for me
Can't you see how happy we would be...

Mmm, we will raise a family
A girl for you and a boy for me
Oh can't you see how happy we would be...",Tea for Two
Julie Andrews,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?
Julie Andrews,"When the skies are brighter canary yellow
I forget ev'ry cloud I've ever seen,
So they called me a cockeyed optimist
Immature and incurably green.

I have heard people rant and rave and bellow
That we're done and we might as well be dead,
But I'm only a cockeyed optimist
And I can't get it into my head.

I hear the human race
Is fallin' on its face
And hasn't very far to go,
But ev'ry whippoorwill
Is sellin' me a bill,
And tellin' me it just ain't so.

I could say life is just a bowl of Jello
And appear more intelligent and smart,
But I'm stuck like a dope
With a thing called hope,
And I can't get it out of my heart!
Not this heart...",A Cock-Eyed Optimist
Julie Andrews,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"

Julie Andrews,"I have dreamed that your arms are lovely
And I have dreamed what a joy you'll be
I have dreamed every word you'll whisper
When you're close, close to me

How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view
In these dreams I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you
I will love being loved by you

In these dreams I've loved you so

Julie Andrews,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch-drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle, of a him and her
I don't like quiet, and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again
Julie Andrews,"If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know how I loved you
If I loved you.",If I Loved You
Julie Andrews,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are...

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me

Julie Andrews,"It seems we stood and talked like this before.
We looked at each other in the same way then,
But I can't remember where or when.

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore.
The smile you were smiling you were smiling then,
But I can't remember where or when.

Where I'll find a field of gold,
But here I'll stay with you;

Where your heart wears a snile all day through.

But I know well they're wrong,
And I know where I belong,
And here I'll stay with you.

You can hear from far and near a world you've never heard before

And on a clear day, on that clear day
You can see forever and ever more

Julie Andrews,"Here in this shell of a house,
This house that is struggling to be.
Falling through the hall,
Coming straight through the wall,
Is hope staring down at me,

Courage stand out like a tree

As a comet in flight.
But hope isn't easy to see.

Julie Andrews,"Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy

I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting

In her own special way to the people she calls

You mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

Though I never really grumble,

I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,

Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much

In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Julie Andrews,"I'm in a nice bit of trouble, I confess;
Somebody with me has had a game.
I should by now be a proud and happy bride,
But I've still got to keep my single name.
I was proposed to by Obadiah Binks
In a very gentlemanly way;
Lent him all my money so that he could buy a home,
And punctually at twelve o'clock to-day-

There was I, waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church;
When I found he'd left me in the lurch,
Lor, how it did upset me!
All at once, he sent me round a note
Here's the very note,
This is what he wrote:
""Can't get away to marry you today,
My wife, won't let me!""

Lor, what a fuss Obadiah made of me
When he used to take me in the park!
He used to squeeze me till I was black and blue,
When he kissed me he used to leave a mark.
Each time he met me he treated me to port,
Took me now and then to see the play;
Understand me rightly, when I say he treated me,
It wasn't him but me that used to pay.

There was I, waiting at the church,
Waiting at the church,

My wife, won't let me!""

Just think how disappointed I must feel,
I'll be off me crumpet very soon.
I've lost my husband, the one I never had!
And I dreamed so about the honeymoon.
I'm looking out for another Obadiah,
I've already bought the wedding ring,
There's all my little fal-de-riddles packed up in my box
Yes, absolutely two of ev'rything.

Julie Andrews,"When the skies are brighter canary yellow
I forget ev'ry cloud I've ever seen,
So they called me a cockeyed optimist
Immature and incurably green.

I have heard people rant and rave and bellow
That we're done and we might as well be dead,
But I'm only a cockeyed optimist
And I can't get it into my head.

I hear the human race
Is fallin' on its face
And hasn't very far to go,
But ev'ry whippoorwill
Is sellin' me a bill,
And tellin' me it just ain't so.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance

And you meet not really by chance

The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture (Excerpt) [From My Fair Lady]

Why can't they understand the way we feel 
They just don't trust what they can't explain 
I know we're different, but deep inside us 
We're not that different at all 

And you'll be in my heart 
Yes you'll be in my heart 
From this day on 
Now and forever more 

Don't listen to them 
'Cause what do they know 
We need each other, to have, to hold 
They'll see in time, I know 

When destiny calls you, you must be strong 
I may not be with you 
But you got to hold on 
They'll see in time, I know 
We'll show them together 

'Cause you'll be in my heart 
Yes you'll be in my heart 
From this day on 
Now and forever more 

Yes you'll be in my heart 
No matter what they say 
You'll be in my heart

Julie Andrews,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I",Bewitched [From Pal Joey]

Getting to like you, getting to hope you like me.

You are precisely, 
My cup of tea.

Getting to know you, 
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you, 
Getting to know what to say 
Haven't you noticed 
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy 
Because of all the beautiful and new 
Things I'm learning about you 
Day by day.

Sharing your spirit, 
Sharing your tears and your laughter 
Hoping it goes on, 
Hoping it lasts endlessly 
Getting to know you, putting it my way, 
But sweetly, 
You are completely, 
My friend you see.

Telling you my dreams, 
Getting to feel that you're with me
Making our own fun, 
Knowing we know how to play

I've found a new pal, beautiful and true
Yes I'm talking about you

But afraid and shy,

But sighing sighs, holding hands

ThatÃ¢??s how I want to be

Julie Andrews,"Well after all, Pickering,
I'm an ordinary man,
Who desires nothing more than an ordinary chance,
to live exactly as he likes, and do precisely what he wants...
An average man am I, of no eccentric whim,
Who likes to live his life, free of strife,
doing whatever he thinks is best, for him,
Well... just an ordinary man...

BUT, Let a woman in your life
and your serenity is through,
she'll redecorate your home,
from the cellar to the dome,
and then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you...

Let a woman in your life,
and you're up against a wall,
make a plan and you will find,
that she has something else in mind,
and so rather than do either you do something else that neither likes at all

You want to talk of Keats and Milton, she only wants to talk of love,
You go to see a play or ballet, and spend it searching for her glove,
Let a woman in your life and you invite eternal strife,
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands...
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling than to ever let
a woman in my life,

I'm a very gentle man, even tempered and good natured who you never hear complain,
Who has the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein,
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips, 
the sort who never could, ever would, let an insulting remark escape his lips
Very gentle man...

But, Let a woman in your life, and patience hasn't got a chance,
she will beg you for advice,
your reply will be concise, and she will listen very nicely,
and then go out and do exactly what she wants!!!

You are a man of grace and polish, who never spoke above a hush,
all at once you're using language that would make a sailor blush,
Let a woman in your life, and you're plunging in a knife,
Let the others of my sex, tie the knot around their necks, 
I prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition than to ever let a
woman in my life

I'm a quiet living man,
who prefers to spend the evening in the silence of his room,
who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb,
A pensive man am I, of philosophical joys,
who likes to meditate, contemplate, far for humanities mad inhuman noise,
Quiet living man....

But, let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through,
in a line that never ends comes an army of her friends, 
come to jabber and to chatter and to tell her what the matter is with YOU!,
she'll have a booming boisterous family,
who will descend on you en mass,
she'll have a large Wagnerian mother, with a voice that shatters glass,
Let a woman in your life, Let a woman in your life, Let a woman in your life
I  shall  never  let  a  woman  in  my  life.",I'm an Ordinary Man
Julie Andrews,"Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face
Julie Andrews,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear

Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Julie Budd,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell
Julie Budd,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Julie Budd,"Last night I waved goodbye,
Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

Waking to the sunlight, being cradled by the moon
Catching fireflies at night, building castles in the sand
Kissing mama's face goodnight and holding daddy's hand
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

Running barefoot through the grass, a little hide and go seek
Being so in love that you can hardly eat
Dancing in the dark when there's no one else around
Being bundled 'neath the covers, watching snow fall to the ground
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

So many things I thought would bring me happiness
Some dreams that are realities today
Such an irony the things that mean the most to me
Are the memories that I've made along the way

So if there's anything I've learned from this journey I am on
Simple truths will keep you going, simple love will keep you strong
'Cause there are questions without answers and flames that never die
And heartaches we go through are often blessings in disguise

And yeah, how could I ask for more? Oh",How Could I Ask for More?

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.

Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go

your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work

Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the are's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?

The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at

We'll have no need of dope, nothing left to escape from
Turned on by life is the best kind of ""high""

We'll drink from streams of cool clear water
That won't stain our lips with the blood of the dead
We won?t see it dripping red through our fingers
In pools on the ground where the bodies have bled.

And we'll open the door and our hearts will be warm
And things will look good when our new day is born

Walk down, etc

So we'll shout out the truth and we'll show how we feel
And just turn away from the dirt in our eye
Cause the young is the new, and the old is the withered
And those that last longest will win by and by

We'll never look back once we reach where we're going
And our road will take us where we want to be
Soon there'll be happiness glowing around us
And all men will love and our children be free

And we'll open our hearts and the sun will shine in
And things will look fine when our new world begins

Walk down, etc",Walk Down
Julie Driscoll,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

This here road leads to Cairo
I got to get me a ride
I got to go back
Go back to my children
I got to see my little bride

Gone a long long time
Don't know what I'll find
Scared of what I'll find
But I just got to see them again

Hey thanks for stopping
Are you headed down to Cairo?
I wrecked my Lincoln in Saint Jo
Why to little old Cairo?
No special reason
Look up some folks I used to know

Me I travel some
Have my share of fun
Now that's a life a man can live
Sure I've played and lost
But who minds the cost
You got to take more than you give

Hey you got another cigar?
Son I sure like this car
Oh from your daddy as a gift
Say on second thought
There's gifts I haven't bought
Just drop me here
Thanks for the lift

Yes I've traveled some
Yes I've been a bum
Never have a dime for gin
Left to make my way
Told her I can't stay
To see my children poor as sin

I know this road
It leads straight into Cairo
Twenty-two miles straight ahead
I can't walk down this road to Cairo

If I'm with friends and we should meet 
Just pass me by, don't even speak

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Would you listen, would you listen

Would you listen, would you listen
There's a great man preaching sending out His word
Would you listen, would you listen

Oh and yes His peace will come in and rescue
Don't you know His blood will cleanse you and save you

Your heart and listen

Would you listen, would you listen
There's a hammer ringing, ringing through the land
Would you listen, would you listen
To a cruel, cruel message
Crucify the man
People listen, listen
'Cause His blood is falling in the sand

When the baby cried we closed our ears to wisdom
When the word was preached we closed our minds to love
And when the hammer rang we closed our hearts to Jesus

Open up your ears, open your heart
Open up your mind and open up your soul
Open up your heart, yeah, open up your heart and listen",[Untitled Track]

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Just walked the floor
Don't know how I'll stand this anymore

I don't know why you cause me such pain
I just hope I just never go through this much again

And thanks to you the sun will never shine

Julie London,"Do you know what it means to walk alone?
And what it means to be, be by yourself?
Do you know what it means when there's no one to bring you good news?
Then you know, you know the meaning of the blues

Do you know what it means to cry alone?
And what it means to cry by yourself?
Do you know what it means to love a woman you can't own?
If you do, then you know the meaning of the blues

I've been weeping and weeping,
Moaning and moaning,
Crying and sighing all the day
I've been hiding my tears

And do you know what it means when the lord is taken away?

Julie London,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,
Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

Julie London,"I don't know exactly how it started,
But it started in fun;
I just wanted someone to be gay with,
To play with someone.
But now I realize that I could never let you go,
And I've come to tell you so;

[Chorus]
Ev'ry kiss, ev'ry hug
Seems to act just like a drug;
You're getting to be a habit with me.
Let me stay in your arms,
I'm addicted to your charms;
You're getting to be a habit with me.
I used to think your love was something that I
Could take or leave alone.
But now I couldn't do without my supply,
I need you for my own.
Oh, I can't break away,
I must have you ev'ry day,
As regularly as coffee or tea.
You've got me in your clutches and I can't get free,
You're getting to be a habit with me,
(Can't break it!)
You're getting to be a habit with me.

I thought it was just another meeting,
But my fate had begun;
Something in my heart kept on repeating,
She's diff'rent, this one.
I'm getting, oh so used to having you around each day,
Don't you ever go away.

Julie London,"See that train coming round the bend,
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth,
But her soul has been called up above

Body and soul, body and soul,
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold,
Her eyes were as blue as the sea,
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose,
And she promised she would always love me

The shadows will cover her face
As her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are falling like rain",Body and Soul

I'll be happy if I had you by my side,

If I could be with you one li'l hour tonight,
And free to do all those little things I might,
I want you to know you wouldn't go,
Until I told you that I loved you so.

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

Make it another old-fashioned, please
Make it another, double, old-fashioned, please
Make it for one who's due to join the disillusion crew
Make it for one of love's new refugees

And oh what a castle, built on a heavenly dream
Then quick as a lightning flash, that castle began to crash

Leave out the orange, 
Leave out the bitters

But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

Not to mention that I love you

Julie London,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
... tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most
Julie London,"All she has to do is say ""Hello""
And that's the sweetest melody I know
The sound of angels singing soft and low
When she makes music

Her laughter is an echo in the breeze
That hushes larks and thrushes in the trees
And calms the wave that rushes from the seas
When she makes music

Any time she breathes a sigh
The symphony begins
Every time she says ""Goodbye""
A million violins start crying

The song is sad until we meet again
We kiss and then the song is sweet again
But whether she is far away or very near
She makes music only I can hear.

Cause that's the night friends come to call
And Monday to Friday go fast
And another week is past

But Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
Until I hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week

Mm Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek

Louie Louie, oh no
Me gotta go
Aye-yi-yi-yi, I said
Louie Louie, oh baby
Me gotta go

Fine little girl waits for me
Catch a ship across the sea
Sail that ship about, all alone
Never know if I make it home

Three nights and days I sail the sea
Think of girl, constantly
On that ship, I dream she's there
I smell the rose in her hair.

Okay, let's give it to 'em, right now!

See Jamaica, the moon above
It won't be long, me see me love
Take her in my arms again
Tell her I'll never leave again

Julie London,"A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows over Lullaby Bay;
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting,
Waiting to sail your worries away.

It isn't far to Hushabye Mountain,
And your boat waits down by the quay.
The winds of night sdo softly are sighing,
Soon they will fly your troubles to sea.

So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain,
Wave goodbye to cares of the day,
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay.

So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain,
Wave goodbye to cares of the day,

Julie London,"Since I went on the wagon, I'm certain drink is a major crime
For when you lay off the liquor, you feel so much slicker
Well that is, most of the time
But there are moments, sooner or later
When it's tough, I got to say, love to say, waiter

Make it another old-fashioned, please
Make it another, double, old-fashioned, please
Make it for one who's due to join the disillusion crew
Make it for one of love's new refugees

Once high in my castle, I ran to you
And oh what a castle, built on a heavenly dream
Then quick as a lightning flash, that castle began to crash
So, make it another old-fashioned, please

Leave out the orange, 
Leave out the bitters

When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.

You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Nobody works on easy street
Just lie around all day, just sit and play the horses

Life is sweet for folks who live on easy street
No weekly payments you must meet
That makes your hair turn gray

When opportunity comes knockin'
You just keep on with your rockin'
'Cause you know your fortune's made

And if the sun makes you perspire
There's a man that you can hire
To plant trees so you can have shade

On easy street, I'm telling everyone I meet
If I could live on easy street I'd want no job today
So please, go 'way

Father didn't like you at all.
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest, and get a bit of rest.

Julie London,"Love, like red wine, must have time to age.
It mellows in flavor with each passing stage.
But even the best of the vinege (vine) goes bad.
And whether it's wine or love, that?s sad.
I won't answer love the next time it knocks.
I've had my fill of love on the rocks.

A jigger of lying, garnished with fights.
Some bitters for crying, long unhappy nights.
A dash of lost dreams, then stir with regret.
Shake well, and pour, then drink and forget.
A tea spoon of teardrops seemed like a phase.
But I cried too many long unhappy days.
Good riddance to love it's too much to bear.
After this drink, I won't even care.

Love on the rocks, time to get high.
I'll drink to love, here's love in your eye
Pop with a bubble, make it a double!

Julie London,"So I walk a little too fast, and I drive a little too fast,
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do

At the end of a love affair?
So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much,
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd,
So that people are apt to stare.

Do they know, do they care, that it's only 
That I'm lonely, and low as can be?

And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all.
So I smoke a little too much, and I joke a little too much,
And the tunes I request are not always the best,
But the ones where the trumpets blare.
So I go at a maddening pace, and I pretend that it's taking his place,
But what else can you do at the end of a love affair?

And wash the shame away?

You can have my heart, if you don't mind broken things

So I give these pieces all to you
If you want it, you can have my heart

So beyond repair, nothing I could do

That you will soon me home but you will never come

I need something like amnesia for things I know
I need something like a mother 'cause I'm just a child
I need something like an asylum 'cause I go wild

I need something, I need you

I need something like dynamite for the mess I'm in
I need something like a tattoo underneath my skin
I need somebody more than a lover in my bed
I need somebody here with me in my head

I need something bad and I need it now
I got something wrong with me
You better fix it 'cause I don't know how

I said goodbye and I know you're alright now

I could be wrong but that's where you'll find me
Out in the rain just looking for you

All the chains that held you down
Will be in pieces on the ground

Take you down to deep water
And I have watched a fragile wing
Tangled up in longings get broken in the struggle

With a kiss you'll wake to see
That you're strong at the broken places
I know someday you'll go free",Ride the Wind to Me

Mother, you know, must hear the news,

Her fond face pale with woe.

Just then the order came to charge,
For an instance hand touched hand.
They said, ""aye,"" and away they rode,
That brave and devoted band.

Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks,
And guarded them as they fell.
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain,
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again.

But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair.
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there.
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said.

And she'll only know he's dead",Two Soldiers

And he's been passed out on the sofa since noon

Away like some bird through the night

That wishes come true

So she married her the captain 
Of the school football team
Just like she was supposed to 
As homecoming queen

She turns out the lights and she lays down in bed

There's somethin' smokin' underneath the hood,
It's a-bangin' and a-clangin' an' it can't be good,
An' it's another fifty miles to the nearest town.
Everythin' I own's in the back in a hefty bag;
I'm outta cigarettes an' I'm down to my last drag.

I'd sure hate to break down here,
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror.
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'.
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'.
So, God help me, keep me movin' somehow.
Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.
I made it this far without cryin' a single tear.
I'd sure hate to break down here.

Under fifty thousand miles ago,
Before the bad blood an' busted radio,
He said I was all he had ever needed.
But love is blind an' little did I know,
You were just another dead end road,
Made with pretty lies an' broken dreams.
Baby, leavin' you is easier than bein' gone.
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong.

Julie Roberts,"I found a book that my mama kept
Filled with secrets she hid
And in a dusty old attic, one mornin' I read
About a woman I never met

Who had dreams like mine
With every page I turned, the words came alive
Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane 

I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance
A tear fell on that faded page
'Cause this was somebody else

Not the mama I knew who never thought of herself
But the times, they were different then
And lines just didn't get crossed
And these words that she wrote, they somehow got lost

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane 
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

The chance that she never had
Is now the gift that is mine
And our here on this road, I'm makin' up for lost time
Yeah, I am my mother's child

As I roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
While I still have the chance

I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance

When I turn to leave

Runnin' hard and fast
But everywhere that I run to
I'm just standing still

Hearing your voice on the machine
It took all I had to just let you talk

I hit my knees and closed my eyes
And I pray that you'd come back
Too many tears washed out that bridge

You want to cross, but baby, it's too late for that
Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me

I've got the perfect place to go
I was thinkin bout a candlelight seafood dinner
At this little place on the gulf of Mexico
Don't look at me like I'm crazy darlin?
Just hear me out
Cause we can be there by tomorrow
If we pack up and hit the road right now
We'll spend the night in Birmingham
At your brother's house on the way down
Then we'll find us a motel room with and ocean view

We'll go for a day or two and just hang out on the beach
It might turn into a week or so, or who knows

I bet you could get a gig sellin hot dogs on the boardwalk
And I could make a buck or two playin buffet tunes

Now it ain't ever been easy

Got the engine hangin' from a tree
Kickin' the tires on the T-Bird

Mamma comes dancin' out the back door
Snappin' a dish towel in her hand
She says, ""Don't you be wastin' all that good energy
Don't you know how I love a sweaty man-oh-man-oh""

I watch the world rushin' by
They're all dreamin' 'bout dollars and thinkin' 'bout
Mountains that they have to climb

A woman checks her reflection
A man straightens his tie
They wear troubled expressions and meanwhile
I just sit here and smile

You can chase all the sliver
If you need riches to hold
You can run after rainbows
'Cause I just found my pot of gold

I just met him last weekend
We've been out a few times
And it may seem too soon, but when he kissed me I knew that
He was my purpose in life

You can chase all the silver
'Cause I've found somethin' to hold
You can run after rainbows
'Cause I just found my pot of gold

Sweet song of the summertime storm
And oh the way that it moves you
It's a melody of passion raging on

Every time he has to go
And I keep wondering just when that'll be

Didn't get my teeth brushed
I crashed on the couch
And now my mouth tastes like yesterday's news

Oh the places you've seen
If only you could talk
You'd tell me why he walked out on me and you

Oh the things lovers do when it's over
Oh the things lovers do when it's done

And try to move on

Thinkin' 'bout our last fight

And all the lights were out and you were gone

Looking down that highway wondering how far it goes
And I can feel your hand resting on my shoulder
Hear you saying, baby, don't forget when you're grown

A little bit south of Montgomery

And Daddy, he worked for the county

When Joe Henry came up the river, y'all
Lord, he made a woman out of me

I guess it served me right

He wouldn't set me free

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

Julie Wilson,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Medley: Lorelei/It Ain't Necessarily So/Sam and Delilah

Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Julie Wilson,"The colors of my life, are bountiful and bold
The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green and gold
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame
The glory of a rainbow, I put 'em all to shame

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

Julie Wilson,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Julie Zenatti,"Je voudrais que tu me consoles
Que tu me prennes dans tes bras
Tu le faisais comme personne
En trouvant les mots chaque fois

Je voudrais que tu me consoles
Afin que je ne sombre pas
Que tu me parles un peu des hommes
Pour m'expliquer je n'ai que toi

Il suffirait 
que tu m'apprennes
Comment ne plus aimer
Enfin apprendre à me passer de toi
Que je comprenne
Puisqu'il faut t’oublier
Savoir pourquoi j'ai tant besoin de toi

Je voudrais que tu me consoles
De celui qui m'a fait si mal
Ou de celui qui m'abandonne
M'aider à trouver ça banal
Il faudrait que tu me pardonnes
D'oublier celui que j'ai aimé
De l'ami, de l'amant ou de l'homme
Garder celui que j'ai pleuré

Refrain

Même si l’histoire
Est aujourd’hui finie
Dis moi au moins qu’il me reste l’ami
Puisque c’est pour toi
Que je suis comme ça
Viens, viens et console moi de toi",Je Voudrais Que Tu Me Consoles

Elle n’est pas docile

Elle a ses raisons
Elle a ses saisons
Moi j’ai mes passions
Mes pleurs, mes prisons

Mais parfois, parfois
Y a de ces moments 
Ou elle est belle 
Comme elle belle 
La vie

Elle file, elle défile
Elle fuit, elle s’exile
Moi je veux savoir
Comment exister 
Quand elle est tristesse 
Quand elle est bassesse

Y a de ces moments 
Ou elle est belle

Cette envie qui me colle
A la folie comme un gant

Pendant qu´on entendait dans le jukebox
Gronder le piano

Elle a obéi
Et puis elle a dit,
""Sais-tu qu´j´t´attends depuis plus d´une heure?""
Dans son hot-dog il a mis du ketchup
Mais quand Lili eut refait son make-up
Elle a dit, ""Salut
Tu n´me reverras plus""
Il lui a mis son couteau sur le cœur

Et puis il l´a
Prise dans ses bras.

""Lili j´voudrais bien t´épouser
Si tu voulais ne plus jamais
Ne plus jamais aller danser
Aller danser le rock 'n' roll""

Elle n´a pas su se désister
Elle n´a pas su lui résister
Elle a dit oui sans hésiter
En pleurnichant sur son épaule

Car elle l´aimait encore plus que l´rock´n roll
Il lui a promis d´l´aimer toute sa vie
D´ailleurs on peut lire encore aujourd´hui
Au-dessus de leur lit,

À endosser la peau d'un poisson, d'un oiseau

De l´Autriche et de la Hongrie,

Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Maintenant, comme avant,
Doucement, sans pâlir, sans mentir, sans souffrir
Aujourd'hui, je te dis,
Tous les voyages ne veulent rien dire
Je sais des choses qui te feraient rire
Moi qui entassais des souvenirs par paresse
Ce sont tes vieux chandails que je caresse

Tu es ma terre, ma mère et mon hiver.

Nous sommes des oiseaux géants
Nous ne voyageons pas souvent
Nous avons l'amour du nid
Que certains appellent patrie

Et le cours de tes saisons, de nos rivières

Elle a les yeux couleur d'ardoise
Le teint clair-obscur du lilas
Mon étrange Carthaginoise
Plus belle que la Reine de Saba

Et si contrairement
A tout ce que l'on croit
Tous nos chemins ne menaient pas
A Rome (bis)

Moi je tomberais dans ses bras
Moi je tomberais dans ses bras, dans ses bras, dans ses bras

Et tous les faubourgs de Carthage
Résonnent du son de ma voix
Je l'ai connue comme un orage
Dont la pluie ne viendrait pas...

Toutes les capitales de l'Europe
Se rendrait bientôt sans combat
Devant sa beauté triomphante
Si seulement elle était là

Et si contrairement
A tout ce que l'on croit

Et je joue ma vieille valse pour faire le monde danser.

Julien Clerc,"Savez-vous ce que racontent
Les dauphins des grandes mers
Une histoire de ce monde
Mais d´un autre univers
Tout près d´un port des Flandres
Il y a bien longtemps
Yann avait un navire
Mais n´avait pas seize ans

N´est pas pirate qui veut
Sur la grande mer du Nord
N´est pas heureux qui veut
Dans la grande course au trésor

Yann fit son équipage
De fuyards encerclés
De forbans les plus louches
Et de filles damnées
Quand ils furent au large
Toutes voiles dehors
Yann et son équipage
Proclamèrent l´Age d´Or

N´est pas pirate qui veut
Sur la grande mer du Nord
N´est pas heureux qui veut
Dans la grande course au trésor

Sur le pont du navire
Toujours il y avait bal
On buvait sans être ivre
On aimait sans carnaval
Vingt vaisseaux de dix empires
Coulèrent Yann un soir
On entendait claquer des rires
Parmi les voiles noires

Avec son équipage
Il partit lentement
Vers d´autres rivages
Chevauchant les grands dauphins blancs
C´est l´histoire que racontent
Les dauphins à leurs enfants

Mais n´avait pas seize ans

Mais n´est pas pirate qui veut",Yann et Les Dauphins

Julien Clerc,"Danser au bord du gouffre
Chanter autant qu'on souffre
Si près du précipice
Danger, terrain qui glisse

Chanter dessous les bombes
Danser dessus les tombes
D'accord tout est perdu
D'accord personne ne viendra plus

On pourrait pleurer
On pourrait oui mais
Nous sommes assez fous
Pour croire les étés sans fin
Et si malgré tout
Tout à coup l'hiver survient
Nous met à genoux
Voudras tu bien

Danser sur des volcans
Chanter mais jusque quand?
Qu'importe, c'est délicieux
Que sortent les tristes et les sérieux

On pourrait pleurer
On pourrait oui mais
Nous sommes assez fous
Pour croire les étés sans fin
Et si malgré tout

Voudras tu bien?

Que ce soit janvier ou décembre, oh
Gagner la chambre

Tu n'as plus soif mais peu importe
Tu crains juste que la lumière
Bientôt soit morte

Que ce soit janvier ou décembre, oh
Gagner la chambre

Encore un verre
Tu n'as plus soif va ne crains rien
Je la connais la peur du noir tout ira bien
Enfant déjà comme il te tardait le matin

Mais à présent je te promets
Plus jamais le lit redouté

Elle a pris ma tête et j’ai dit oui
Elle a pris mes bras pour toutes ces nuits
Elle a pris mon cœur

Julien Clerc,"Partout la musique vient
Partout la musique va
Le Titanic se souvient
Que la musique était là

Sur le navire qui chavire
Le grand bateau qui prend l'eau
Quelques mots.

Pour l'orchestre pris au piège
Du lent naufrage dans le noir
Jouer avec vous ce soir
Messieurs, fut un privilège

Partout la musique vient
Partout la musique va
Les soldats le savent bien
La musique marche au pas

Le joli son du clairon
Le beau discours du tambour
Et un jour

La musique s'en va-t-en guerre
Et au rythme des canons
Elle chante dans les sillons
Qu'abreuvent les militaires

Hm hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm

Partout la musique vient
Partout la musique va
Au terminus de ces trains
Dont personne ne reviendra

Pauvre car de voyageurs
Triste ensemble de corps qui tremblent
Il me semble

Qu'une musique coupable
D’étouffer en mélodie
Les derniers cris d'agonie
D'un génocide indéniable
Mériterait en pénitence
Plus d'une minute de silence",Partout la musique vient
Julien Clerc,"Il n'est rien de plus doux
Que ta main sur mon cou

La mélancolie, fin de weekend
Train de banlieue vers Bourg la Reine

Il n'est rien de plus chaud que ton corps
Quand s'en reviennent d'entre les morts
Les fantômes des étés enfuis
La plage en novembre sous la pluie

Tu sais les hommes seuls
Tu sais les enfants tristes
Et tu sais les chagrins qui insistent
Tu sais les heures pâles
Tu sais les moments flous
Et puis tu sais le remède à tout

Le froid ou la fièvre
Rien ne résiste à tes lèvres
Tout s'incline tout se couche
Rien ne résiste à ta bouche

Il n'est rien de meilleur que ton cœur
Quand par hasard ou par malheur
Le souvenir des années perdues
Fait que mon regard se dilue

Tu sais le monde vieux,
Tu sais le temps cruel
Et tu sais les regrets qui s’emmêlent
Tu sais les coups bas,
Les gifles sur les joues
Et puis tu sais le remède à tout

L'ennui ou la faim,
Rien ne résiste à tes reins
Tout recule, tout flanche
Rien ne résiste à tes hanches

Passées contre toi dans ce lit
Les nuits passées à dormir debout
Contre toi qui est pour moi tout

Pour moi tout",Tout

Ouvrir grand les bras si tu reviens dans le jeu

Petit, c'est bien trop serré

Il porte le poids de la peine
Que tu lui fais endurer

Pour me sentir plus léger?

Car mon cœur, hélas, je crois
Est si las de tout cela
Que plus rien ne le retient
Voilà qu'il ne veut plus battre en vain
Pour toi

Parce que j'ai le cœur si plein
Qu’à peine je peux le bouger
Si je le bouscule, je crains
Qu’il ne vienne à déborder

Il est rempli des sanglots
Que j'ai versés, mais que faire
Dois-je l’emmener en bateau
Et le vider dans la mer

Car mon cœur, hélas, je crois
Est si las de tout cela
Que plus rien ne le retient
Voilà qu'il ne veut plus battre en vain

Qu'il ne veut plus battre en vain

Cloué au lit à même le bois
Non plus rien ne le retient

Because of what you've done to me

I need you so
Baby just don't let me go

I need you so
Baby just don't let me go

Se promettre ma douce
L'enfer et ses sources
Où les vipères rousses
Se meuvant me troublent
Je deviens sauvage
Mon torse se décharne
Pour que Paris s'enflamme
De nos retrouvailles

Baby I love you less and less
Because of what you've done to me

Baby I love you less and less
Because of what you've done to me

Baby I love you less and less
Because of what you've done to me

Baby I love you less and less
Because of what you've done to me

We used to be, we used to be, we used to be, we used to be
Very happy
What lies all night
Remember feel so alive
Now all that there is
The sweet souvenir
I walked down on the river
I put my feet in the water
I remember I remember we used to come here together

I need you so,
Baby just don't let me go

I need you so,
Baby just don't let me go

Baby I love you less and less

Baby I love you less and less
Because of what you've done to me",Chou wasabi

Whenever I see the truth

And I know, they'll try to tempt you with shallow vices
So darling let go, there's more to life than broken promises

I did all my best to smile
til your singing eyes and fingers
drew me loving into your eyes
And you sang
＂Sail to me, sail to me, let me enfold you＂
Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was full sail?
Now my foolish boat is leaning, broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sang, ＂Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow＂
Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow
I'm as puzzled as a newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or shall I lie with death my bride?

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the car
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load

Man made electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Man think about a little bitty
Baby girl and a baby boy
Man makes then happy
'Cause man makes them toys

And after man has made everything, everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

But this is a man, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Julieta Venegas,"Si quieres un poco de mí
Me deberías esperar
Y caminar a paso lento
Muy lento
Y poco a poco olvidar
El tiempo y su velocidad
Frenar el ritmo, ir muy lento, más lento

Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo
Ser delicado y esperar
Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo

Si quieres un poco de mí
Dame paciencia y verás
Será mejor que andar corriendo
Levantar vuelo
Y poco a poco olvidar
El tiempo y su velocidad

Frenar el ritmo, ir muy lento
Cada vez mas lento

Dame tiempo para darte
Todo lo que tengo
Ser delicado y esperar
Dame tiempo para darte

Tus ojos mirándome la calle que canta
Su canto de diario el mundo moviéndose
Y yo se que tienes miedo y no es un buen
Momento para ti y para esto que nos viene sucediendo

Pero eres para mi me lo ha dicho el viento
Eres para mi lo oigo todo el tiempo

Lo pinta tal como es mi cuerpo que no tiene peso
Si escucho tu voz y amándome
Y yo se que tienes miedo y no es un buen
Momento para ti y para esto que nos viene sucediendo

Revienta extraño mirarte de lejos de
Hacernos los tontos parecemos tan viejos
Tiempo que dices tiempo mírame la piel
No ves acaso lo que siento
Tu eres para mi yo soy para ti

Y yo se que tienes miedo y no es un
Buen momento para ti (para mi)

Nos hicimos bien y luego tuvimos que partir
Y nunca supimos como y amar esto que nos hizo
El piso se nos movió y todo quedo distinto

Julieta llego el dante
Si supiera como volver atrás lo haría
Para mirar tus ojos y perderme en ellos todo el día
Algunas noches siento que no existe la salida
Confieso que extraño lo que por ti sentía
Yo cuido tu alma ma' y tu la mía
Lo sabias cuando te fuiste que me partías
Hubo momentos que pensé que me moría
Igual nada cambiaría de aquellos grises días

Hoy es el primer día que voy a decir esto
Digas lo que digas siempre seras mas
Que una amiga reina mía
Hoy es el primer día que voy a decir esto
Tu primer día mi primer día
Contare las horas hasta que vuelvas a ser mía

Sembrando donde hay
Buscamos todo lo que puede
Cuidar a quien viene atrás

Julieta Venegas,"Desde que te apareciste de repente todo parece brillar
Todas estas melodías no decían nada y ahora dicen más
Ah, ahora dicen mas

Todo lo que me importaba desde tu llegada no importa ya
Lo que parecía difícil ya no representa dificultad
Ah, rio con facilidad

Pero me pongo a dudar me confundo y no distingo
Si esta bien o si esta mal
Si esta bien, agradezco y te corresponderé
Si esta mal, como nunca llorare
Mientras tanto he puesto todo por saber

Me gusta encontrar que existe en la vida esa posibilidad
De que todo se de vuelta cuando no esperaba ya novedad
Ah, llego bien luego se va

Pero me pongo a dudar me confundo y no distingo
Si esta bien o si esta mal

Y lo que tuvimos 
Una bella historia de amor 
Que terminó 
Me diste tanto y yo me entregué

Es tan bueno despedirnos 
Como habernos conocido 
Es tan bueno aceptar 
La derrota como puede luchar 

Por lo que tuvimos tu y yo 
Y se acabo
Por eso brindemos hoy 

Te pido no lo intentes más 
La puerta se a cerrado 
Busca tu felicidad

Con la duda de decir una cosa

Dime como estás
Sólo escuchándolo
Sabré la verdad
Puedo parecer caprichosa
Pero soy mucho más sensata
De lo que vas a pensar
Al verme siguiendo una sombra
Te diré quien soy cuando sepa
Pero cada vez

Sé un poco menos
Puedo cambiar a cada momento
Es parte de mí

Dime como estás
Sólo escuchándolo
Sabré la verdad
Sé que tú podrás decir quién soy

Julieta Venegas,"Vamos caminando en soledad
Pasando los días tranquilamente
Ocupando el tiempo, sin saber en que

Puedo fácilmente prescindir
De una sonrisa de complicidades
Sin nadie a mi lado
Si no sé que es

Y así el porvenir un día aparece
Te mira de frente y te dice
Ven, hay algo que tu no sabias ver

Es como sucede que no hay más
Ser uno parece espacio vacio
No estar a tu lado ya no sabe bien

Ay, estar vivo es lo mejor
Si puedo encontrarte
Puedes quererme
Podemos juntos
Volver a nacer

Y así el porvenir un día aparece
Te mira de frente y te dice
Ven, hay algo que tu no sabias ver

Y así el porvenir un día aparece
Te mira de frente y te dice
Ven, hay algo que tu no sabias ver, pero fue",Porvenir

You got your dicks in a twist and you're raising your fist
But your argument has been bought and paid for

So flex that corporate muscle with your media circle jerks
While you sell out humanity
ADHD, OCD, social anxiety
It's money baby!

All I see is white noise
With your pussy collection and your simple minds
I never knew tits could sell so many cars
And you fucking debutantes with your skin-flicks
What the fuck's the matter with you?
Gloss up your lips, Show us your tits
All for your fifteen minutes of nothin'
I just gotta laugh at you

Not of this world, now the forest swallows her name

I want relief not defeat

Juliette and the Licks,"I feel dirty and cheap like I'm built from the street
Fresh blood and dead meat, another child's been beat
Yesterday is always too far away
And all my tomorrows won't save me today

High heels clippin' like clattering cans
You'll find the mark in the shadow of a man
I've been wronged by my wrongs again, oh Lord

All my life has come and gone, disappeared my mind
And I can't right my wrongs
I felt like nothing was real, all tattered and blue like a gutted sheep
And oh, I'm having visions again

Hawk eyes stare down a vacant hall
Down on your knees head blind to the call
One, two, oh, surprise, there's four
Locked in a room I ran for the door

Come on bitch, or should I call you a whore?
Knocked to the floor, my head opened and poured
I been raped and battered and stuffed like a dog
A ravaged animal, a slaughtered hog
Black turns to white, am I talking to God?

All my life has come and gone, disappeared my mind
And I can't right my wrongs
I felt like nothing was real, all tattered and blue like a gutted sheep
And oh, I'm having visions again

I'll give you eyes of gold

To never do what you're told

Don't ever regret your past
Why is it looking back

Even when it's for free it's never enough
And I know I gave it all to you
So you get what you want it's never enough
Enough, enough, enough

Wearing my death veil my eyes shut so tight
They've got me surrounded

Pour faire briller l'bazar
Crisser les trottoirs
C'était un samedi
Un samedi soir
Un moment funny
Beau et bizarre

Avec cette bouffée d'angoisse
J'aimerais tant briser la glace
Qu'enfin quelqu'un m'laisse une trace
M'évader dans l'espace
Un samedi soir plein d'espoir

Sous les projecteurs
J'sentais monter la sueur
Dans l'fond d'ton regard
Le quarante cadence
Laisse-moi mener la danse
Devenir ton miroir
Car c'est ton samedi
Ton samedi soir
Ton moment funny
Beau et bizarre

Avec cette bouffée d'angoisse
J'aimerais tant briser la glace
Qu'enfin quelqu'un m'laisse une trace
M'évader dans l'espace
Un samedi soir plein d'espoir

Mort aux idées noires
Viens boire un verre au bar
Fixer droit mon regard
Tout est dans ta tête
Choisis de faire la fête
Je commence seulement à t'aimer
Samedi soir, samedi soir, samedi soir
Samedi soir, samedi soir, samedi soir

J'rentrerai p't'être ce soir
Avec toi, va savoir
Dans l'aube, éblouie
J'mettrai au placard
Mes bas roses, mes beaux bas
En catimini
Oui, moi ça m'dit
Moi ça m'dit d't'voir
Est-ce que ça t'dit?

Juliette Gréco,"Dans un boudoir introduisez un coeur bien tendre
Sur canapé laissez s'asseoir et se détendre
Versez une larme de porto
Et puis mettez-vous au piano
Jouez Chopin
Avec dédain
Egrenez vos accords
Et s'il s'endort
Alors là, jetez-le dehors

Le second soir faites revenir ce coeur bien tendre
Faites mijoter trois bons quarts d'heure à vous attendre
Et s'il n'est pas encore parti
Soyez-en sûr c'est qu'il est cuit
Sans vous trahir
Laissez frémir
Faites attendre encore
Et s'il s'endort
Alors là, jétez-le dehors

Le lendemain il ne tient qu'à vous d'être tendre
Tamisez toutes les lumières et sans attendre
Jouez la farce du grand amour
Dites ""jamais"", dites ""toujours""
Et consommez
Sur canapé
Mais après les transports
Ah! s'il s'endort
Alors là, foutez-le dehors

In a boudoir enter a tender heart good
On sofa let sit and relax
Pour a tear from Porto
And then you put the piano
Play Chopin
With disdain
Fluff your agreements
And if he falls asleep
While there, throw it out

The second evening stir fry the heart of this tender
Simmer three good quarters of an hour you wait
And if it is not yet party
Be sure to is that it is cooked
Without you betray
Let simmer
Make wait
And if he falls asleep
While there, jétez it out

The next day it is up to you to be soft
Sift all the lights and without waiting
Play the farce of the great love
Say ""forever"", saying ""always""
And eat
On Couch
But after transport
Ah! if asleep
While there, foutez it out",La Recette de l'Amour Fou
Juliette Gréco,"Dieu que la vie est cruelle
Au musicien des ruelles
Son copain son compagnon
C'est l'accordéon

Qui c'est-y qui l'aide à vivre
A s'asseoir quand il s'enivre
C'est-y vous, c'est moi, mais non
C'est l'accordéon

Accordez, accordez, accordez donc
L'aumône à l'accordé l'accordéon

Ils sont comme cul et chemise
Et quand on les verbalise
Il accompagne au violon
Son accordéon

Il passe une nuit tranquille
Puis au matin il refile
Un peu d'air dans les poumons
De l'accordéon

Accordez, accordez, accordez donc
L'aumône à l'accordé l'accordéon

Quand parfois il lui massacre
Ses petits boutons de nacre
Il en fauche à son veston
Pour l'accordéon

Lui, emprunte ses bretelles
Pour secourir la ficelle
Qui retient ses pantalons
En accordéon

Accordez, accordez, accordez donc
L'aumône à l'accordé l'accordéon

Mais un jour par lassitude
Il laissera la solitude
Se pointer à l'horizon
De l'accordéon

Il en tirera cinquante
Centimes à la brocante
Et on fera plus attention
A l'accordéon

Juliette Gréco,"Nous sommes étonnés de ce qui nous arrive
On ne peut croire encore
Que nos cœurs vagabonds, errant de rive en rive
Se sont choisi un port
Et chaque jour, surpris de se trouver unis
Ensemble, on se sourit
En répétant ensemble

Si ce n'est pas l'amour
Si ce n'est pas l'amour
Dieu que ça lui ressemble!

Notre passé nous a enseigné la méfiance
Et vivant au présent
Nous attendons tous deux, résignés à l'avance

Craignant de voir le pire au détour d'un sourire
Ensemble, on se rassure
En ayant peur ensemble

Si ce n'est pas l'amour

Nous n'avons pas voulu mettre nos cœurs en cage
Épris de liberté
Nous nous donnons le droit de partir en voyage

Quand on n'est pas ensemble

Incertains de la vie, incertains de nous-mêmes
On voit passer le temps
Sans oser se risquer à dire que l'on s'aime
Sans le croire vraiment
Pourtant, main dans la main, on rêve d'un chemin
Ensemble commencé
Qu'on finirait ensemble

Tu es parti depuis trois jours à pein’
Le temps ne passe pas vite

Que l’on se quitte

Tu es parti pour dix huit jours

Que c’est long que c’est long

Je suis amorphe, je vis volets fermés
Pleurant des heur’s sur mon lit
Et je ne vois personne de la journée
A part la concierg’ qui me monte des fruits

Et puis hier treizième jour
Et puis hier Pierr’ m’a téléphoné
Il dit qu’on ne meurt d’amour
Et m’a invité à diner

Depuis il passe tous les soirs me chercher
Bref on ne se quitte plus
C’est fou ce que Paris est gai cette été
On dans’ et je rentr’ à l’aub’ toute courbatue

Juliette Gréco,"Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
S'en va le ruisseau jusqu'au grand fleuve de la plaine

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
S'en va mon amour à la dérive au fil du temps

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Rien ne peut changer ni du courant ni de ma peine

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
J'ai fait comme l'eau je suis allée vers l'océan

Mais en arrivant j'ai rencontré
Celui qui allait te remplacer
Sans rien dire il a su me plaire
Et j'ai refait chemin contraire

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
On est mieux en remontant jusqu'à la source

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Le soleil a fait de mon c?ur une fleur des champs

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Une ombre est venue troubler la fin de notre pose

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Encore une fois je me retrouve sans amant

Car les jeux de l'eau et de l'amour
Sont insaisissables sans retour
Quand je les croise je regrette
De ne pouvoir tourner la tête

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
S'en va le ruisseau jusqu'au grand fleuve de la plaine

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
S'en va mon amour à la dérive au fil du temps

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
S'en va le ruisseau jusqu'au grand fleuve de la plaine

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
S'en va mon amour à la dérive au fil du temps",Tout Doucement

Tous les gens bien intentionnés
M'avaient fermé la porte au nez
Ce n'était rien qu'un feu de bois
Mais il m'avait chauffé le corps
Et dans mon âme il brûle encore

Que les vieux amoureux firent leurs épousailles

And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

J'why accroche le vent, j'why retiens la tempête
J'why prolonge le soir et j'why cache le jour

Mais moi, pauvre de moi, j'ai ma croix dans la tête
Un mot why est gravé qui resemble à ""souffrir""
Mais ce mot familier que mes lèvres répètent
Est si lourd à porter que j'en pense mourir",Les Croix
Juliette Gréco,"Oh je voudrais tant que tu te souviennes
Cette chanson était la tienne
C'était ta préférée, je crois
Qu'elle est de Prévert et Kosma

Et chaque fois les feuilles mortes
Te rappellent à mon souvenir
Jour après jour les amours mortes
N'en finissent pas de mourir

Avec d'autres bien sur, je m'abandonne
Mais leur chanson est monotone
Et peu à peu je m'indiffère
à cela il n'est rien à faire

Car chaque fois, les feuilles mortes
Te rappellent à mon souvenir
Jour après jour les amours mortes
N'en finissent pas de mourir

Peut on jamais savoir par où commence
Et quand fini l'indifférence
Passe l'automne vienne l'hiver
Et que la chanson de Prévert

Cette chanson, les feuilles mortes
S'efface de mon souvenir
Et ce jour là, mes amours mortes
En auront fini de mourir

Et ce jour là, mes amours mortes
En auront fini de mourir",Le Chanson de Prévert

L’amour rase les murs
Le long des rues en pentes
Le vent trop chaud murmure
Sur la sieste soûlante

La ville désertée
Sans père ni sans mère
Appartient aux guerriers
Qui marchent Solitaire

L’amour rase les murs
Brodée de maigres fleurs
Sous ce regard bleu dur
Blanchie par tant de pleurs

La fontaine asséchée
Aux lions de carnavals
Crient par leurs bouches bées
Sa misère et son mal

(Pont Musical)

L’amour rase les murs
Le coma écarlate
Est loin des voiles pures
Masquant les faces plates

Le solitaire grimpe
Vers le très vieux calvaire
C’est peut-être l’Olympe
C’est peut-être l’Enfer",Le Solitaire
"Julio ""Paíto"" Figueroa","Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan

Julio Chaidez,"¡De nuestro amor! Que más recuerdas
Si una canción, la noche aquella
Que te entrego, aquel poeta
Que inspiro en mi tristeza

Porque aquella noche
Presente tía que su amor
Ya no sería como antes para mí

Pero fue bonita aquella noche cuando
Dos que sean amado
Se despidieran así

Era de esperarse cuando yo
La vi alejarse para siempre de mi lado
Yo jamás avía llorado por su amor
Pero esta vez llore

Te vi pasar, como una niña
Porque te irías amada niña

Porque aquella noche
Presente tía que su amor
Ya no sería como antes para mí

Pero fue bonita aquella noche cuando
Dos que sean amado
Se despidieran así

Era de esperarse cuando yo
La vi alejarse para siempre de mi lado

Yo jamás avía llorado por su amor

Cuentan mi dios, mi amor, tú y yo

Que nos importa que digan lo que digan
Vivimos nuestro mundo, vivimos nuestro amor
Si no lo entiende el mundo, sino lo entiende nadie
Somo' ajenos y vivimos nuestro amor

Y somo' ajenos pero
Nos amamos

Que todos son de la mar
Conozco un pueblo de hombres

Van cantando su morriña
Su saudade y su pesar
Y, cantándole al mar
Los marinos se van 
Unos por no llorar
Otros, para olvidar

Se las lleva el mar ¡se las lleva el mar! 
Las penas y las tristezas se van, 
Se las lleva el mar ¡siempre el mar!

Que nunca podré olvidar 
Tan fuertes como las rocas
Tan bravos como la mar
Tienen alma de poeta
Poesía que les da el mar 
Sus vidas son las leyendas 
Que en su pueblo contarán
Y, cantándole al mar

Unos por no llorar

And just like the guy whose feet are 
Too big for his bed

They keep falling
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job 
Those raindrops are falling on my head 
They keep falling
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me 
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head

But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain 
By complaining
Because I'm free, nothing's worrying me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

En un rincón del desván tan sólo queda un adiós 
Parece que fue ayer cuando temblabas de amor
Quizás fue que lo soñé Quizás, mi amor

Los sueños de ayer
las primeras rosas
el beso que te robé
Y muchas más cosas

Al atardecer
al hacerse oscuridad
la tenue luz de un quinqué 
en el desván

Pero aquel tiempo pasó 
y ya nada importa
En nuestras vidas no hay 
ni amores, ni rosas

Pero aquel tiempo pasó 
y ya nada importa
En nuestras vidas no hay 
ni amores, ni rosas

Y qué tristeza me da volver de nuevo al desván
Y qué tristeza me da sabiendo que ya no estás
¿Recuerdas el butacón? Está en el mismo lugar
Mi perro ya se murió en el desván

Pero aquel tiempo pasó 
y ya nada importa
y sin embargo, mi amor
hay sueños y hay rosas

Julio Iglesias,"Todos dicen 
Que yo soy un hombre solitario 
Que no tengo amigos ni un amor
Que ando los caminos 
Sin que nadie me a acompañe
Que soy vagabundo y soñador

Que poco saben de mi vida los demás 
Sólo murmullos, y ya me quieren juzgar
Es verdad que soy un poco triste y solitario 
Más o menos, como los demás

Tengo una guitarra 
Que da vida a mis canciones
Compañera de mi soledad
Tengo mil amores
Mil historias, mil razones;
Que el tiempo se encarga de borrar

Tengo una casa 
En la montaña junto al sol 
Y un perro viejo 
Que me da siempre razón

Que contar

Y los amantes
Pero no los señores
Me gusta ser amigo de los ladrones

No soy de aquí, ni soy de allá 
No tengo edad ni porvenir 
Y ser feliz es mi color 
De identidad

No soy de aquí, ni soy de allá

Mañana cuando canten las cigarras
Mañana cuando el sol caliente más 
Y vuelva como siempre a aquella playa
Y vea que, mi amor, tú ya no estás

Preguntaré a la arena dónde estás
Al viejo del camino, a la brisa del mar
Preguntaré si saben dónde estás

Y me iré buscando otro lugar 
Donde nada me haga recordar
Yo me iré tratando de olvidar
Olvidar que no regresarás
Mañana, si volvieras a mi lado
Yo te diría lo mucho que te amé
Las veces que mis manos te han buscado
Las noches que en silencio te lloré

Confesso que ao contemplá-lo
Confesso com sentimento, meu pensamento, ai, me atraiçoava

Diz docemente em seus anseios 
Pedindo que me atendesses, que convertesses 
Em realidade, meus devaneios

Alejarse de su casa
Y subir a la montaña
Ver llegar a la mañana

El cantar de las cascadas
Y el arrullo de las cañas
Ver crecer a los trigales
Su río lleno de agua

Y cantar por las veredas
Su libertad y esperanza
Y enamorar a una estrella
Entre la noche y el alba

Los inviernos los pasaba
Al calor de una cabaña
Y se sentía poeta
Entre todos los poetas
Conquistador de cariños
De profesión peregrino

Por compañero el destino
Yamigo de sus amigos
Amante al llegar la noche
De la estrella y del rocío

Era de vida bohemia
De corazón repartido
Era su alma la lluvia
Que regaba los caminos
Por las sierras se escuchaban
Sus cantares, sus plegarias

Y a pesar de que te fuiste
Muy temprano de la vida
De tu montaña y tu río
Tu mirada es el rocío

Tu voz se quedó en el viento
Tus penas por el camino
Tu alma entre las montañas
Tus lágrimas por el río

Tu libertad y esperanza
No se han marchado contigo
Tu libertad y esperanza
Van andando los caminos.
Por los montes y los ríos
Se oye el canto de aquel indio

Julio Iglesias,"Por el amor de una mujer
Jugué con fuego sin saber
Que era yo quien me quemaba
Bebí en las fuentes del placer
Hasta llegar a comprender
Que no era a mi a quien amaba

Por el amor de una mujer
He dado todo cuanto fui
Lo más bonito de mi vida
Mas ese tiempo que perdí
Ha de servirme alguna vez
Cuando se cure bien mi herida

Todo me parece como un sueño todavía
Pero sé que al fin podré olvidar un día
Hoy me siento triste pero pronto cantaré
Y prometo no acordarme nunca del ayer

Por el amor de una mujer
Llegué a llorar why enloquecer
Mientras que ella se reía
Y en pedazos un cristal
Dejé mis venas desangrar
Pues no sabía lo que hacía

Por el amor de una mujer
He dado todo cuanto fui
Lo más bonito de mi vida

Julio Iglesias,"Nunca pude imaginar que por un beso
Tu llegaras a cambiar así en mi vida
Conocerte trastornó mi pensamiento
Why yo apenas lo creía

No he podido descansar con tu recuerdo
Why me encuentro solo en mi melancolía
El creer que soy un parte de tus sueños
Me devuelves a alegría

Por un poco de tu amor
Por un trozo de tu vida
La mía entera yo te la daría
Sólo a ti
Por un poco de tu amor

Por un beso, nada más
Por un roce de tu boca
Cualquier felicidad seria poca
Por tener
Solo un poco de tu amor

Aunque sé que no me quedan esperanzas
Es bonito imaginar como seria
Si me dieras ese amor que me hare falta
Para consolar mi herida

Necesito para continuar viviendo
Engañar mi corazón con la mentira
De pensar que soy el dueño de tus besos
Why que tengo tus caricias

Por un poco de tu amor
Por un trozo de tu vida
La mía entera yo te la daría
Sólo a ti
Por un poco de tu amor

Por un beso nada mas
Por un roce de tu boca
Cualquier felicidades seria poca
Por tener
Sólo un poco de tu amor

Un lugar donde nadie ha podido llegar

Quiero que tú me acompañes, mujer
Que mi canto amanezca dormido en tu piel
Y decirte al oído, sin miedo al olvido
Mis versos queridos, mis versos de ayer

Quiero perderme en tu cuerpo y anclar
En tu puerto mi barca vacía de amor
Escribir en la arena mi llanto y me pena
Dejar que las olas borren mi dolor

Quiero que tú me acompañes, mujer
Que compartas conmigo tu vida y después
Cuando el viento del otoño acaricie tu sien
Estar juntos y unidos iguales que ayer

Quiero enseñarte un camino en el mar
Un lugar donde nadie ha podido llegar
Donde el viento es amigo, la brisa un suspiro
Que abraza tu cuerpo, pequeña, al pasar

Quiero que tu me acompañes, mujer
Que mi canto amanezca dormido en tu piel
Y decirte al iodo, sin miedo al olvido

Julio Iglesias,"Tú, si en el camino hacia tu casa 
Sientes que una sombra te acompaña, 
Sono io, 
El tonto que ha llegado a enamorarse 
Con serias intenciones de casarse, 
Proprio io.

Si abres la ventana de tu cuarto 
Y ves que hay siempre un coche estacionado, 
Sono io, 
El tipo justo para una aventura 
Y luego abandonarlo en la basura, 
Proprio io.

Y si en la noche, cuando estás dormida, 
El timbre de un teléfono te grita, 
Sono io, 
Un hombre que no puede ya olvidarse 
Que fuiste su primer y gran amor.

Si el día de tu santo llegan flores 
Sin firma, sin palabras ni razones, 
Sono io, 
Un loco que recuerda a cada instante 
El tiempo de un amor ya tan distante, 
Proprio io.

Si alguna vez descubres que tu amiga 
De noche sale siempre con alguno, 
Sono io, 
Que quiero usar el arma de los celos 
Creyendo que con ello soy tu dueño, 
Proprio io.

Y si en la noche buscas otros brazos 
Y sientes que alguno está llorando, 
Sono io, 
Un hombre que no puede ya olvidarse 
Que fuiste su primer y gran amor.

Y tú que me decías que en amores 
De todos tus recuerdos, los mejores 
Eran míos.

Aquel que cada noche deseabas, 
Aquel que cada día más amabas, 
Sempre io.

Y hoy el que se siente abandonado, 
Aquel que en tu recuerdo está olvidado, 
Sono io, 
Un perro fiel cansado por los años 
Soñando de un amor desesperado, 
Proprio io.

Mas si después que el tiempo haya pasado 
Recuerdas que tan sólo uno te ha amado, 
Sono io, 
Un hombre que no puede ya olvidarse 
Que fuiste su primer y gran amor.

Me hiciste daño sin querer
Pequeñas cosas que olvidé
Al ver tu amor amanecer 

Y tantas veces yo también
Igual que un niño me enfadé
Cerré mi puerta a tu querer
Cuando moría por volver

A veces tú, a veces yo
Reñimos sin tener razón
Sin más por qué
Sin más error
Que por orgullo de los dos 

A veces sí, a veces no
Lo dices tú, lo digo yo
Palabras sin ningún valor
Pequeñas cosas del amor  Y es que a veces tú también
Por mi lloraste alguna vez
Y con mis besos yo sequé
Tu llanto triste de mujer 

Tú me enseñaste a comprender
Que en nuestro amor no existe ayer
Y yo en mis brazos te enseñé
Que a nadie más puedo querer","A Veces Tu, a Veces Yo"

Julio Iglesias,"Di tanto sentire bruciare la pelle
di tanto gridare ""ti amo"" alle stelle
e poi per tradire la tua fedeltà
mi sono giocato la felicità
Di tanto dir bene sapendo che è male
di tanto spiare chi scende, chi sale,
mi sono scordato la vita e l'amore 
e le piccole cose che avevo io in cuore. 
Non si vive così. Non si vive così. 
Non si vive così. Non si vive così. 
Di tanto viaggiare per cielo e per mare, 
di tanto vedere per poi non guardare, 
e pur di arrivare al numero uno, 
non penso che a me e non credo a nessuno. 
Di tanto cambiare la notte col giorno, 
di tanto avvisare: ""Stasera non torno"", 
mi sono scordato la vita e l'amore 
e le piccole cose che avevo io in cuore. 
Non si vive così. Non si vive così. 
Non si vive così. Non si vive così. 
Di tanto dormire in un letto straniero, 
di tanto sognare un sogno non vero, 
mi sono venduto quest'anima mia 
ma solo ai transistors e alla discografia. 
Di tanto accettare chi conta e non vale, 
di tanto seguire un mondo banale, 
mi sono scordato la vita e l'amore 
e le piccole cose che avevo io in cuore.

Que morirían en mis manos si te fueras

Tengo mil noches de amor que regalarte
Te doy mi vida a cambio de quedarte

Y hasta te admito que tu amor me lo mintieras
Te adoraría aunque tú no me quisieras

hemos estado tanto tiempo juntos 
Y por guardar las apariencias 
hemos vivido sin amor alguno. 

Llegar a casa cada día 
Llenaba de melancolía el alma 
Y despedirse al otro día 
Era la huida de una vida falsa. 

Por no saber decir a tiempo 
Vete ya de mi, 
Por ocultar los sentimientos, 
Por querer mentir. 

Por esas viejas tradiciones 
se fueron tantas emociones nuevas 
Y sin amor por conveniencias 
perdimos tantas ocasiones buenas. 

En cada frase había un reproche 
mirar ausente y tantas noches solas, 
Y en cada gesto había un pretexto 
para evitar el encontrarse a solas.

¿dónde va? que mi voz 
Ya no quiere escuchar
¿dónde va? que mi vida se apaga 
Si junto a mi no está
Si quisiera volver

Me quedaré sin nada, si te vas

Abrázame
y no me digas nada, sólo abrázame
No quiero que te vayas pero sé muy bien
Que tú te irás

Abrázame
Como si fuera ahora la primera vez
Como si me quisieras hoy igual que ayer
Abrázame

Si tú te vas
Me quedará el silencio para conversar
La sombra de tu cuerpo y la soledad
Serán mis compañeras, si te vas

Si tú te vas
Se irá contigo el tiempo y mi mejor edad
Te seguiré queriendo cada dí­a más
Esperaré a que vuelvas, si te vas",Abraçame

Wo bist du?

Manchmal denk' ich, daß ich dich vergessen hab'
Manchmal kann ich wieder richtig fröhlich sein
Doch wenn ich nach Haus komm' aus der bunten Stadt
Holt mich immer wieder die Erinn'rung ein.

Und ich frag mich, wie es dir wohl gehen mag
Ist der Traum von deiner Freiheit heute wahr?
Träumst du von den Tagen, die das Glück uns gab
Oder ist schon lang ein andrer für dich da.

Wo bist du?

Und ich geh' viel aus und bleibe nicht allein
Aber wenn ich glaub', ich hab' mich neu verliebt
Sehne ich mich nur danach, bei dir zu sein.

The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships 
Then where am I to go?

You're all that's left me, too

You come and pour yourself on me

I can taste it in your kiss
I can hear it in the silence 
And we both know what it is
It's the last time

There's nothing I can say 
I haven't said before 
If I've made mistakes along the way 
I can't have loved you more 
There's no side of me I'm hiding 
No new way to make you care 
I've tried everything I can and still 
The feeling isn't there, and

It's the last time 
And I can't belive it's true 
If I had a chance with anyone 
I swear my chance was you

It's the last time 
And I'm angry and I'm scared 
And I don't know what I'll do 
When I wake up and you're not there
It's the last time

It's the last time 
I just can't believe that you don't need me 
The last time 
I juts can't belive that you would leave me 
The last time 
I'll be such a lonely man, belive me 
The last time

The last time

Gotta gotta be down

It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

You're lying beside me
Keeping me warm in the night

If I had my way I'd gather my wishes
And whisper them all in your ear
I never knew heaven could be so near

I thought that I was wise
I never let my heart control my mind
I thought that I had it all, I felt my life complete
And love became a word I left behind

And then I saw you there, my every breath slipped away
I couldn't speak, I couldn't think, all I could do was stare
With just one look in your eyes, I felt the room disappear
All that I could see was you

We were two lovers, two people
Much in love to say goodbye
Now we're two strangers, two children
Too proud to say who's wrong or right

I tried the best I could to make you understand
Look at me, I'm not like any other man
But now I've come to see, you're not like all the rest
What we had was special, we could have had the best

When we made love, we set the night on fire
Caught up in our desire, we never said hello
Is it as clear to you as it is to me?
We must have been out of our minds
How could we say goodbye?

Con quíen estás, que tal te va
Que caro cuesta este perder
Lo que era todo ya no es nada
Se para el tiempo en el ayer
Te contaran más de una vez
Que sigo igual, que no cambié
Que busco en cada madrugada
Lo que perdí con tu querer

Ya no es rencor
Apenas duele el desamor
Qué te cambió
Qué le contaste de los dos
Dile que fui
Un soñador, que tuve un sueño
Con quien estás, que tal te va
Que caro cuesta este perder
Lo que era todo ya no es nada
Se para el tiempo en el ayer
Te contaran más de una vez
Que sigo igual, que no cambié
Que busco en cada madrugada

Julio Iglesias,"Tú y yo
Estúpidos amantes, fuimos tú y yo
Perfectos comediantes fuimos tú y yo
Dos necios que jugaron al amor
Tú y yo
Pasamos por la vida como un huracán
Quisimos ser gaviotas sin saber volar
Hicimos tantas cosas sin pensar
Si aún decides que quieres volver
No te importe que puedan decir
Ese orgullo que me hizo perder
Sólo me habla de ti
Y si piensas que todo acabó
Que no has sido a mi lado feliz
Yo prefiero saberlo también
Aunque me haga sufrir
Tú y yo
Enamorados, tontos, fuimos tú y yo

Equivocados, locos, fuimos tú y yo
Pequeños ignorantes del amor
Tú y yo
Pasamos por la vida como un huracán
Quisimos ser gaviotas sin saber volar
Hicimos tantas cosas sin pensar
Si aún decides que quieres volver
No te importe que puedan decir
Ese orgullo que me hizo perder
Sólo me habla de ti
Y si piensas que todo acabó
Que no has sido a mi lado feliz
Yo prefiero saberlo también
Aunque me haga sufrir

Otra vida que no sea sin ti
La verdad es que no quiero saber
Lo que piensas de mi",Tu y Yo
Julio Iglesias,"Porque sigo sempre só por esa estrada
como um vagabundo
porque ao meu lado não existe nada
que me mostre o rumo.
Porque a vida ensinou e aprendemos
a guardar segredos
porque sei que no amor nos entendemos
é melhor seguir pensando só em mim.

Porque sei que para você é importante
se mostrar senhora
mas eu sei que o prazer de um instante
não se joga fora.

Já sabemos muito bem o que nós somos
e o que queremos
como vê, sou um romântico discreto
é melhor seguir pensando só em mim.

Porque apenas eu
prometo te entregar
todo o amor que te faz falta
prometo dar prazer
e te abrigar na minha calma
sem ter que estar buscando
nem disculpas nem palavras.

Porque apenas eu
prometo descobrir
todo o amor que te faz falta
prometo te provar
que nem o medo nos separa.

que de mí no está distante.
Alguien,
Alguien.

Alguien,
que va a arrastrarme
como arrastra la hoja al viento.
Alguien,
que para siempre
va a volar mi mismo vuelo.
Alguien,
que seguirá mis pasos

Alguien,
alguien.

Alguien,
con quien beber
las emociones gota a gota.
Alguien,
con quien amar
y conquerer las mismas cosas.
Alguien,
con quien dichoso

Alguien,
alguien.

Alguien,
que me traerá
el calor que alta por la casa.

Alguien, que llenará mi vida
como nunca nadie.

siempre huyendo de la realidad,
no queriendo ver
que al final del día no estarás.

que ya de mi vida,
tu no esperes nada.

Yo he ido destrozando día a día,
por olvido a veces,
cosas tan bonitas.

o llevarte rosas,
cualquier día del año.

Pero ahora estoy
intentando enamorarte,
intentándolo otra vez, amor,
y aunque digas que ya es tarde
yo sé que aún
hay algo vivo entre los dos.

Intentando enamorarte,
aprendiendo a hacerte más feliz,
procurando darte y darte
lo que en su día,
por rutina,
no te di.

todas las promesas,
que te fui jurando.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando tus labios de niña
mis labios los estrenaban.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando tu vientre era aún
una colina cerrada.

Lo mejor de tu vida
me lo he llevado yo,
lo mejor de tu vida
lo he disfrutado yo.

Tu experiencia primera,
el despertar de tu carne,
tu inocencia salvaje,
me la he bebido yo,
me la he bebido yo. Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando tu cuerpo era espiga
de palma reciénplantada.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando cerrabas los ojos
apenas yo me acercaba.

Fuiste mía,
sólo mía,
mía, mía,
cuando temblaban tus manos
tan sólo si las rozaba.

Explícale si puedes sin herirla,
por qué me marcho sin decirle adiós.
No soy amigo de las despedidas;
lo bello está al principio del amor.

Le dices que no ha sido una aventura,
que me ha llegado incluso a enamorar,
que olvide de quien pudo ser la culpa;
la vida es la culpable y nadie más.

Procura hablarle tú,
tú la conoces
mejor que yo,
procura hacerle ver,
que es imposible,
volver,
volver.

Jamás oculto a nadie mi locura,
mi forma caprichosa de querer;
que entienda y que perdone mi postura

We reach for the best we can
But sometimes it slips away
No ma matter how we plan.
You were the best thing in my life
My only hope of getting' it right
Who would've thought we'd get to have
A second time around?

But now that love is on our side again
Let's take these feelings all the way
Let's open up and live our passions to the end
Now that love is on our side again.

I loved you too much
Without you i felt so wrong
It's funny how we tear ourselves apart, just to belong
I'll never ever compromise
That look of trust within your eyes
We'll let our hearths grow forever
Here on solid ground.

Now that love is on our side again
Let's take these feelings all the way
Let's open up and live our passions to the end
Now that love is on our side again.

We're ready for that dream
We'll get it right

A time to heal our wounds
Is all we need.

My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true is ever
Letting all their love come through

My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love
Fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too

Let my love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over

Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more is

Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know
Enough to say they feel as we
And let our universal song be free

Let our love shine throughout the world
To every mountain tap and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
Til love's all over

Say words of love to all we see
To rich or poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spread love all over

Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea

And I owned my life, and no one owned me

Yes, she got her break, and so did I   
Yes, she broke my heart for another guy   
Yes, she broke my heart for another guy, for another guy

Too many women too many women...   
Too many women too many women...

But I traded them for some romance   
Look what I'm facing just 'cause of chasing   
Too many women too many women...   
Too many women too many women...   

When I see the mess that I'm drowning in   
I know why I'm here, after where I've been   
If the truth be told I would have to say   
It was worth the price, that I had to pay   

Though they break your heart, and make you cry   
I can hardly wait 'till the next comes by   
I can hardly wait (don't know why, don't know why)

We'll talk to the trees
And worship the wind
But if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand

If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go was I know you must
There'll be nothing left
In the world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face

Can I tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly
Till your next hello

I'll sail on you smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes

A friend my whole life through
Always saw the best in me
As only friends will do

And both of us were blind
We made it through the careless years
Love has been a friend of mine

Love has been a friend to me
Companions of the heart
Following where passion leads
We learn what fools we are

Even when it breaks my heart
And hope is hard to find
I still remember all the ways
Love has been a friend of mine

In a world ever changing
Every season must end
Love makes only one promise
It will find you again

I remember every word
That love has ever said
To a perfect melody
Running through my head

On a not too far tomorrow
I'll sing back every line
The title of my song will be
'Love Has Been A Friend Of Mine'

Love is happiness and sorrow
It's everything in time

Julio Iglesias,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Julio Iglesias,"Yesterday when I was young 
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue. 
I played at life as if it were a foolish game 
The way the evening breeze plays with a candle flame. 
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned 
I always built to last on weak and shifting sands 
I lived by night, declined the naked light of day 

And only now I see the years that ran away 
Yesterday when I was young 
So many crazy songs were waiting to be sung 
So many crazy times that lay in store for me 
And so much pain inside, my heart refused to see 
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out 

I never stopped to think what life was all about 
And every conversation that I can now recall 
Had all to do with me, and nothing else at all 
Yesterday the moon was blue 
And every crazy day brought something new to do 
I used my magic age as if it were a wand 

And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond 
The games of love I played with arrogance and pride 
And every flame I lit, so quickly quickly died 
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away 
And only I am left on stage to end the play 
Yesterday when I was young","Yesterday, When I Was Young"
Julio Iglesias,"To all the girls I've loved before
Who traveled in and out my door
I'm glad they came along

To all the girls I've loved before

To all the girls I once caressed
And may I say, I've held the best
For helping me to grow, I owe a lot, I know
To all the girls I've loved before

The winds of change are always blowing
And every time I tried to stay
The winds of change continued blowing
And they just carried me a way

Who now are someone else's wife
I'm glad they came along

To all the girls who cared for me
Who filled my nights with ecstasy
They live within my heart

Julio Iglesias,"Esos amores tan amados, tan queridos
Que yo he ganado why otras veces he perdido
Amores sin medida, son parte de mi vida.
Difícil es vivir sin recordarlos

Esos amores del presente why del pasado
Que sus caricias en la piel nos han dejado
Que el corazón no olvida por más que haya una herida
Difícil es vivir sin recordarlos

Son amores que recuerdo a cada instante
Los conozco why a su lado yo he vivido
En mis noches yo también los he tenido
Me han amado why todos fueron importantes

Esos amores
Son las gotas del perfume de la vida
Los amamos, los queremos sin medida
Why en sus brazos, ¡cuántos sueños realizamos

Esos amores
Son momentos de tristeza why alegría
El comienzo why el final de cada día
La llegada del amor o despedida

Esos amores del presente why del pasado
Que sus caricias en la piel nos han dejado
Que el corazón no olvida por más que haya una herida

Julio Iglesias,"Lía con tu pelo un edredón de terciopelo
Que me pueda guarecer
Si me encuentra en cueros al amanecer
Lía entre tus labios a los míos
Respirando en el vacío aprenderé
Como por la boca muere y mata el pez
Lías telaraña que enmaraña mi razón
Que te quiero mucho y es sin ton ni son
Lías cada día con el día posterior
Y entre día y día, lía, lía
Lía con tus brazos
Un nudo de dos lazos
Que me ate a tu pecho, amor
Lía con tus besos
La parte de mis sesos
Que manda en mi corazón
Lías mis miradas a tu espalda
Por debajo de tu falda, con perdón

Por poner los ojos junto a la intención
Líame a la pata de la cama
No te quedes con las ganas de saber
Cuánto amor no cabe de una vez
Lías cigarrillos de cariño y sin papel
Para que los fume dentro de tu piel
Lías a la cruceta de ésta pobre marioneta
Y entre lío y lío, lía, lía
Lía con tus brazos
Un nudo de dos lazos
Que me ate a tu pecho, amor
Lía con tus besos
La parte de mis sesos
Que manda en mi corazón

Julio Iglesias,"Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run
Galveston, oh, Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying
In the sun, at Galveston, at Galveston",Milonga Medley: Milonga Sentimental/Vivo

Que busca la noche

Somos en nuestra quimera

Dos hojas que el viento
Junto en el otoño ¡Ay!

Somos dos seres en uno
Que amando se mueren
Para guardar en secreto
Lo mucho que quieren

Pero, ¿qué importa la vida
Con esta separación?
Somos dos gotas de llanto
En una canción

Somos un sueño imposible
Que busca la noche
Para olvidarse del tiempo

Y en zapatos los pies
Como todos los niños
Tu trajiste al nacer
Y un camino altibajo
Que poder recorrer
Cuesta abajo un trocito
Cuesta arriba después
Y aunque te haga calor
Vete igual por el sol
Que la sombra está bien
Pa’los blandos de piel
Que les pique el sudor
Si le da por llover
No te dé por correr
Que mojarse es crecer
Y corriendo entre charcos
Te puedes caer

Cuando apriete el calzado
Y otras cosas también
No habrá sitio a tu lado
Que ya habrá una mujer
Y no habrá ya energía
Pa’seguir a tu pie
Tu andarás de mañana
Y yo de atardecer
Y aunque te haga calor
Vete igual por el sol
Que la sombra está bien
Pa’los blandos de piel
Que les pique el sudor
Si le da por llover
No te dé por correr
Que mojarse es crecer
Y corriendo entre charcos
Te puedes caer

Más temprano o más tarde
Parará tu reloj
Y si es cierto que hay meta
Allí te espero yo
Y si no es mal de muchos
Que funciona tan bien
Aunque ya sin cabeza
Poco habrá que entender
Y aunque te haga calor
Vete igual por el sol
Que la sombra está bien
Pa’los blandos de piel
Que les pique el sudor
Si le da por llover

No te dé por correr
Que mojarse es crecer

E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo de Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto, tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e' vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un elica
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi, all'improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto, tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e' vene sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare e parole
Confondono i pensieri

Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là, in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica
Ah sì è la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto, tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e' vene sai

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto, tanto bene sai

Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Tomar el mejor camino

Julio Iglesias,"Bajando la ladera
Por el camino viene bailando
Arrastra la sandalia
La polvareda va levantando
Moviendo la cintura
Why las caderas como ninguna

Tiene la piel morena
Sonrisa clara
Color de luna

Tiene cosas de blanca
Tiene cosas de negra
Tiene cosas de india
Bonita mezcla que da esta tierra!

Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna
Moviendo las caderas
Moviendo la cintura

Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna
Arrastra la sandalia
Llévame en tu locura
Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna

La noche es una niña
Que va pasando, que va creciendo
La música no para
Sigue bailando, se va encendiendo
El sudor de su cuerpo le pone brillo a su piel canela
La blusa colorada, la madrugada why esa morena

Tiene cosas de blanca
Tiene cosas de negra
Tiene cosas de india
Bonita mezcla que da esta tierra

Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna
Moviendo las caderas
Moviendo la cintura

Baila morena, baila

Julio Iglesias,"Llueve y está mojada la carretera
Qué largo es el camino, qué larga espera!
Kilómetros pasando pensando en ella
Qué noche, qué silencio! Si ella supiera
Que estoy corriendo
Pensando en ella

Las luces de los coches que van pasando
El ruido de camiones acelerando
No hay gente por la calle y está lloviendo
Los pueblos del camino ya están durmiendo
Y yo corriendo
Pensando en ella

Sigo en la carretera buscándote
Al final del camino te encontraré
Aceleré

Los bares a estas horas están cerrando
Hoteles de parejas siempre esperando
Un tren me cruza el paso es largo y lento
Me comen la cabeza los pensamientos
Pensando en ella
Pensando en ella

Sigo en la carretera buscándote
Al final del camino te encontraré
Aceleré

Pensando imaginando mi duda aumenta
Me salgo de una curva sin darme cuenta
La aguja marca una cuarteta

Sigo en la carretera buscándote
Al final del camino te encontraré

Llueve y está mojada la carretera
Y yo sintiendo celos pensando en ella
Perdido entre la duda y la neblina
Me estoy quedando solo sin gasolina

Llueve y está mojada la carretera

No sé si está con otro, si yo supiera

Lo que iba a suceder

El último verano
Tomados de la mano
Es algo tan lejano
Why no te he vuelto a ver

El último verano
Yo sé que nos amamos
Vivimos abrazados
Siempre juntos los dos

Tirados en la arena
Hablamos del futuro
Estábamos seguros
De que era un gran amor

Pero algo tan extraño
Que le llaman destino
Nos puso en el camino
La angustia de un querer

El último verano
Tomados de la mano
Es algo tan lejano
Why no te he vuelto a ver.

El último verano
Jamás podré olvidarlo
Why voy a recordarte
Como te conocí

Con esa piel morena
Esos ojos bonitos
La mirada insistente
Que buscaba por mí

Yo sé que habrá tristeza
Que no voy a olvidarte
Why al no poder amarte
No sé que voy a hacer

Quiero que sepas
Que al irme dejo la vida
¡Adiós! 

Al dejarte, pampa mía
Ojos y alma se me llenan
Con el verde de tus pastos
Y el temblor de las estrellas
Con el canto de tus vientos
Y el sollozar de vihuelas

Julio Iglesias,"Que el mundo fue y será una porquería
Ya lo sé, en el quinientos seis
Y en el dos mil también
Que siempre ha habido chorros
Maquiavelos y estafaos
Contentos y amargaos, varones y dublé

Pero que el siglo veinte
Es un despliegue de maldad insolente
Ya no hay quien lo niegue
Vivimos revolcaos en un merengue
Y en el mismo lodo
Todos manoseaos

Hoy resulta que es lo mismo
Ser derecho que traidor
Ignorante, sabio, chorro
Generoso o estafador

¡Todo es igual, nada es mejor!
¡Lo mismo un burro que un gran profesor!
No hay aplazaos ni escalafón
Los inmorales nos han igualao

Si uno vive en la impostura
Y otro roba en su ambición
Da lo mismo que sea cura
Colchonero, rey de bastos
Caradura o polizón

¡Qué falta de respeto qué atropello a la razón!
¡Cualquiera es un señor!
¡Cualquiera es un ladrón!
Mezclao con Stravinsky va Don Bosco
Y La Mignon, Don Chicho y Napoleón
Carnera y San Martín

Igual que en la vidriera irrespetuosa
De los cambalaches
Se ha mezclao la vida
Y herida por un sable sin remache
Ves llorarla Biblia contra un calefón

¡Siglo veinte cambalache!
¡Problemático y febril!
El que no llora no mama
Y el que no afana es un gil

¡Dale nomás, dale que va!
¡Que allá en el horno¡
!Nos vamos a encontrar!
No pienses más, sentate a un lao
Que a nadie importa si naciste honrao
Es lo mismo el que labura
Noche y día, como un buey
Que el que vive de los otros
Que el que mata, que el que cura
O está fuera de la ley",Cambalache

Una sombra lo mismo que yo

Desde que se fue
Triste vivo yo

Yo también me voy
Desde que se fue 
Nunca más volvió
Seguiré sus pasos

Yo a tu lado quisiera caer 
Y que el tiempo nos mate a los dos

Julio Iglesias,"Con este tango que es burlón y compadrito 
Se ató dos alas las emoción de mi suburbio 
Con este tango nació el tango y como un grito 
Salió del sórdido barrial buscando el cielo
Conjuro extraño de un amor hecho cadencia 
Que abrió caminos sin más ley que su esperanza
Mezcla de rabia, de dolor, de fe, de ausencia 
Llorando en la inocencia de un ritmo juguetón

Por tu milagro de notas agoreras 
Nacieron sin pensarlo las paicas y las grelas
Luna en los charcos, canyengue en las caderas 
Y un ansia fiera en la manera de querer

Al evocarte
Tango querido
Siento que tiemblan las baldosas de un bailongo 
Y oigo el rezongo de mi pasado
Hoy que no tengo
Más a mi madre
Siento que llega en punta 'e pie para besarme 
Cuando tu canto nace al son de un bandoneón

Carancanfunfa se hizo al mar con tu bandera 
Y en un perno mezcló Paris con Puente Alsina
Fuiste compadre del gavión y de la mina 
Y hasta comadre del bacán y la pebeta
Por vos susheta, cana, reo y mishiadura
Se hicieron voces al nacer con tu destino
Misa de faldas, kerosén, tajo y cuchillo 
Que ardió en los conventillos y ardió en mi corazón

Siento que tiemblan las baldosas de un bailongo

En mi pobre vida paria solo una buena mujer

Como no quisiste a nadie, como no podrás querer

Se dio el juego de remanye, cuando vos, pobre percanta
Gambeteabas la pobreza en la casa de pensión
Hoy sos toda una bacana, la vida te rie y canta
Los morlacos del otario los tiras a la marchanta
Como juega el gato maula con el misero ratón

Hoy tenes el mate lleno de infelices ilusiones
Te engrupieron los otarios, las amigas, el gavión
La milonga entre magnates con sus locas tentaciones
Donde triunfan y claudican milongueras pretensiones
Se te ha entrado muy adentro en el pobre corazón

Nada debo agradecerte, mano a mano hemos quedado
No me importa lo que has hecho, lo que haces, ni lo que harás
Los favores recibidos creo habértelos pagado
Y si alguna deuda chica sin querer se me ha olvidado
En la cuenta del otario que tenés se la cargas

Mientras tanto que tus triunfos, pobres triunfos pasajeros
Sean una larga fila de riquezas y placer
Que el bacan que te acamala tenga pesos duraderos
Y te abrace en las paradas con cafishios milonqueros
Y que digan los muchachos es una buena mujer

Y mañana cuando seas descolado mueble viejo
Y no tengas esperanzas en el pobre corazón
Si precisas una ayuda, si te hace falta un consejo
Acordate de este amigo que ha de jugarse el pellejo
P'ayudarte en lo que pueda, cuando llegue la ocasión",Mano a Mano

De aquel nuestro amor 
Aún te acuerdes de mi

Y aún recuerdo aquel ayer 
Cuando estabas junto a mi 
Tu me hablabas del amor 
Y aún podía sonreir 
Y aún recuerdo aquel ayer 
Y ahora te alejas de mi

Le he pedido al silencio 
Que me hable de ti 
He indagado en la noche 
Queriéndote oir 
Y al murmullo del viento 
Le he oido decir 
Tu nombre gwendoline",Gwendolyne
Julio Iglesias,"Tire tu panuelo al rio
Para mirarlo como se hundia.
Era el ultimo recuerdo
De tu carino que yo tenia
Se fue yendo despacito
Como tu amor
Pero el rio un dia
A la playa
Al fin me lo volvera
Pero yo se bien que nunca jamas
Podre ser feliz sin tus alegrias.
Te recordare en mi soledad
En el nido aquel que quedo sin luz
Cuando comprendi que ya no eras mia.",Rio Rebelde
Julio Iglesias,"Cuando me encuentres cansado 
Y en un camino perdido
Cuando mi alma se apague
Dame la mano, amigo

Que nunca encontró su nido
Fui como un perro sin amo 
Que nunca tuvo cariño
Y siempre nacen las flores
Y siempre nieva en invierno
Voy siguiendo mi camino
Y a más que vivo, más muero
Y aunque mi rostro no tenga 
Las huellas que deja el tiempo
Yo he andado mil caminos 
Y aun viviendo estoy muerto

Y siempre nacen las flores
Y siempre nieva en invierno
Voy siguiendo mi camino
Y mientras vienen, yo vuelvo
Y no quisiera perderte

Entre tu vida y la mia
Entre la noche y el alba
Se van pasando los dias

Quin no recuerda esa edad
Llegados los diecisis
Cuando queremos tener
Algunos aos de mas

Y quin no quiere ocultar
Un poco el tiempo de ayer
Cuando se empieza a encontrar
Alguna arruga en su piel

Treinta y tres aos
Nada mas son media vida
Treinta y tres aos
Que se van con tanta prisa

Treinta y tres aos
De querer a quien lo pida
Treinta y tres aos
Como usted quien lo diria

A veces miro hacia atras
Con la nostalgia que da
El recordar esa edad
Cuando se juega a ganar

Y hoy si quiero apostar
Me toca tanto perder
Y es que el amor tiene edad
Aunque no lo quiera usted

Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry starry night
You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

Starry starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They did not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will",Vincent (Starry Starry Night)

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way.

For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way.",My Way
Julio Iglesias,"Foi pelo amor de uma mulher
Que eu fiquei sem me entender
E até brinquei com a própria vida
E me deixei ficar assim
Sabendo que era para mim
Uma conquista já perdida

Foi pelo amor de uma mulher
Que eu me fiz um sonhador
A ter a vida tão sofrida
Eu que era sempre um vencedor
Tornei-me então um perdedor
E me ficaram as feridas

Era todo um sonho, ela já não me queria
Eu tentei mostrar que por ela eu não sofria
Hoje vivo triste, mas eu sei que mudarei
Pois eu quero esquecerme dela de uma vez

Foi pelo amor de uma mulher
Que aprendi como sofrer
Deixei de lado a alegria
Passei então a compreender
O lado triste do viver
A me esquecer do que queria

Foi pelo amor de uma mulher
Que de repente enlouqueci
Amando a quem eu não devia
Eu fui escravo desse amor
E fiquei cego pela dor
Não me importando com a vida

Era todo um sonho, ela já não me queria
Eu tentei mostrar que por ela eu não sofria
Hoje vivo triste, mas eu sei que mudarei
Pois eu quero esquecerme dela de uma vez

Foi pelo amor de uma mulher
Que aprendi como sofrer
Deixei de lado a alegria
Passei então a compreender
O lado triste do viver
A me esquecer do que queria

Foi pelo amor de uma mulher
Que de repente enlouqueci
Amando a quem eu não devia
Eu fui escravo desse amor
E fiquei cego pela dor
Não me importando com a vida",Pelo Amor de uma Mulher
