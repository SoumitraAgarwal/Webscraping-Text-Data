Loverboy,"All they got down here is liberty,
Talked to her brother down in Frisco Bay,
He ain't seen nuthin' there but silicone,
I called her mommy up the ozone way,
She wouldn't put her on the telephone,

[Chorus]
Why won't she see me,
She's not looking well,
Some girls just like to push their luck..
Until they wind up.. DOA, DOA, DOA

I paid a visit to a Dr.J,
He thought it might have been her chromosome,
So he put blue jeans in her DNA,
I guess that's why she's not coming home,
Spend all my money on her luxuries,
I guess I'll need a bigger salary,
Her lonely life is such a mystery,
I keep her picture in my gallery, ya!

[Chorus]

Talked to her brother down in Frisco Bay,
He ain't seen nuthin' there but silicone,
I called her mommy up on ozone way,
She wouldn't put her on the telephone,

Loverboy,"If you can read between the lines
Then you can tell me what my next move will be
It's just a matter of time before the whole wide world will see

And when you tell me that I'm wrong
In the morning, I'll be gone
And if you've heard it all before
Then it just don't matter no more

Why don't you tell me what you're after?
Why don't you say what's on your mind?
How will you feel the morning after,
When all there is is what I've left behind?

And when you tell me that I'm wrong
In the morning, I'll be gone
And if you've heard it all before

Why don't you tell me what you're after?
Why don't you say what's on your mind?
How will you feel the morning after,
When all there is is what I've left behind?

Cause when you tell me that I'm wrong

Loverboy,"We just heard of a brand new wave
And we hope its here to stay

We heard he opened up a brand new door
Well you know that's what I'm lookin' for
Well have to wait and see if it makes you shout for more

How do you like him so far?
How do you like his show?
How do you like the way he rocks and the way he rolls?

The Kid is hot tonight
Whoa so hot tonight
But where will he be tomorrow?

Loverboy,"When you look into his eyes
Comes to you as no surprise
It's always the same
Every time he's out with you
He tries to tell you what to do
You don't need it that way

Sometimes you think you're playing the fool
He's running around breaking all the rules
Somehow that don't seem fair
There's got to be a better way
You know what I'm trying to say

'Cause deep, deep down inside
You're living in a life in total lies

What did he ever do for you
What's he trying to put you through
I just don't understand

You showed him love and tenderness
Touched him with your sweet caress
Now he's leaving you

So what's the point in working it out
Tell me what it's all about
That's why I'm saying

I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over

You won't be lonely when it's over
You won't be lonely (you)
When it's over

It's over, it's over, it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over

And in the morning when he's gone
Please don't sing that sad, sad song
I don't want to hear it

Forget about him
Let him go
It won't hurt what he don't know

What's he trying to say to you
What's he trying to tell you
He don't really care

Face the truth and realize
You don't need his alibi's
No more

I hope you're with me when it's over

Lovex,"Few drops left of my hope
I bleed in the name of faith
Decisions I've made, decisions of fools
Why am I bleeding for you

Missing the one who gave me nothing
The one who dreamed my dreams away

Why am I bleeding in my, bleeding on my soul
Why am I bleeding for you

Flaming pride in your eyes
Out of the ashes I'll build mine
Reason and feelings will never meet in me
Why am I bleeding for you

I couldn't live life like you could
I'm still the one misunderstood
I couldn't be the dream,
The lonely heart to seal your scheme
I couldn't live the life you love
",Bleeding
Lovex,"Why didn't I embrace
Those days you spent with me
For now when I look back in time
It's too easy to see

While I lived my dream
I was seeking a fantasy
And here I lie all alone again
Drown in memories

You're so far away from me

I live to love again
But it won't do you any good to see me 
When I die a little more
And all the vanity

Has vanished from my world
Just to show me 
How I die a little more

I'm bound to stumble
Every time I try to fly
Can't get up, can't take a breath
I fall down, I cry

No light in the end
Storm after the rain
Only thing that I've got left
Is the blood inside my veins
",Die a Little More

I'll hold your head up high

When I see your smile

Will you take me in your arms

Low Stars,"Woke up one morning to find tracks in the rain
I went to follow them to find from where they came
Over a hill and then underneath a bridge
Down by a riverbank I stood along a ridge

The voice in the meadow, accompanied by rain
Such a sound to behold, singing this refrain

There's a river to cross, a mountain to climb
A bridge for you to build over the tide
When the water is deep, the valley is low
Wash away your troubles and watch that river flow

I followed that sound in the things that we said
Got me out of a cabin where a gun was next to bed
I'd been laid low for the things I had done
Then these words appeared to me on the tip of my tongue

I can't stop singing them over and over again
Don't remember not knowing then, when it all began
It's like some ancient someone came over a hill
So you might think you know something but you don't know nothing 'til

There's a river to cross, a mountain to climb
A bridge for you to build over the tide
When the water is deep, the valley is low
Wash away your troubles and watch that river flow

So I'm carrying this melody with me everywhere
When my burden gets heavy amidst most all my cares
Through this life we're living, you got to take it day by day
You never know what's coming or going along the way

There's a song for every person, a cure for every pain
Just keep singing, you'll find tracks in the rain

A bridge for you to build over the tide
When the water is deep and the valley is low

Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold.

Hopin' high would help me swallow everything.

Lying lifeless, helpless, heaven help us.

Throwin' back their hearts on the lifeline
Makin' a dime.

They teach us how we do belong
And some old people have arise
Looking forward embracing their role through the night
And some old people hate to change
Except when they're praying away the things they need to shame
And some young people say they aren't hypocrites
Say that they accept everyone and they help some
And some young people like to act like old people
Wearing bows ties and telling us we're wrong
And some old people don't remember when they were kids
And they never choose who they liked
That they liked who they did, they liked who they did

Ten years from now I hope I'll be happy

Perché il loro oblio ha qualcosa di struggente
Libero dalle catene del giudizio della gente
Libero dalle rime, libero dalle pastiglie

Vorrei soltanto essere una sagoma di gesso
Un angelo disegnato al suolo fra i cocci di bottiglie

Per addormentarmi racconta una storia bella
Di un bambino intelligente con un’ottima pagella
Si sente insignificante come la particella
Di sodio in quella vecchia pubblicità di merda
Il ragazzo c’ha un amico, è l’unico di cui si fida
L’amico è un tipo strano, ha una forma di apatia
Hanno una passione in comune, quella di odiare la vita
Di amare i film d’autore, gli aereoplani e la poesia

Oro, rose, oasi, astri
Scherzi, sogni, odio, orgasmi
Organi, cemento, armi
Ho pensato di ucciderti ed anche di suicidarmi
Ma in fondo chi non l’ha fatto?
Vedi, non siamo speciali affatto
Mi piacerebbe vivere nel tuo stereo
Mezzanotte e zero zero, esprimi un desiderio

C’ho messo tanto a imparare a rappare semplice
Ricordi quel periodo assurdo in cui rappavi pure te?
Ricordi quando il dolore noi non riuscivamo a esprimerlo?
L’insicurezza ed essere in balia dell’opinione altrui
Le canne sopra una panchina, assenti, in preda a piccoli problemi
Oppure presi da un’intesa folle e risate sguaiate
A tredici anni a Trastevere ubriachi scalzi
Salto sul muro, il calcio volante di Matrix
La cultura si misura in base all’ambizione
E l’ambizione si misura in base alla cultura
Il nostro retaggio, il coraggio, la ribellione
Bruciando lentamente in una camera arancione
E poi, ultima cosa, ci tenevo a dirti che quando parlavi
Della fortuna avevi ragione
Io parlo di niente e tutto, parlo del tuo inferno
Di te ascoltatore ipocrita, mio simile, fratello

Scherzi, sogni, odio, orgasmi
Organi, cemento, armi
Ho pensato di ucciderti ed anche di suicidarmi
Ma in fondo chi non l’ ha fatto?
Vedi, non siamo speciali affatto
Mi piacerebbe vivere nel tuo stereo
Mezzanotte e zero zero, esprimi un desiderio

Quando sogno io vedo la madonnina
Mi piace perché è d’oro e troneggia sopra il duomo
Poi mi sconvolgo e penso che la mia vita
È bella solo nell’idea di ciò che credi che sono
Ma io vorrei salvare quei momenti
Tirare su dei tempi che col tempo tu contempli
Catturare i frammenti belli e poi farci un mosaico
Psycho dramma, vivo la boheme dell’arte che osanna solo i talenti, ah

Stare da soli è bello ma è una cosa strana
Nel mio lavoro l’amicizia è una nota stonata
L’unico modo purtroppo è offendere tutti
Prima di tutto chi si ama

Poche strade e abitanti, tanti alberi e campagna
Va in un liceo con tre classi più l’aula magna
E dalle medie è assieme alla stessa compagna
Si è innamorata di un tipo e si chiama Nico
Quanto è carino, quando lo vede si bagna
Ma Nico esce con una della loro classe
 
Lara e la sua amica detestano quella cagna
Hanno diciassette anni, sognano poco
Sognare non è un abitudine del luogo nel quale sono cresciute

Di non vedere niente negli occhi di chi ti guarda?

""Ieri stavo sola a casa nel bagno di mamma
Volevo tagliarmi i capelli con il rasoio
Ho messo la mano su una lametta da barba
Mi sono chiesta che prova una ragazza che si taglia?”

Pensa che è una stupida e che non l’ha mai capita, lei
Lei soffre troppo ma fuori fa meno male
Ha bisogno di tagliarsi, vuole sentirsi reale

Un po’ le sembra di cadere
Un po’ le sembra di vedere Agnese, la sua amica del cuore
Lei è sempre stata cortese e crede a tutto ciò che sente
Pensa che fortuna esserle amica

Prima ero un fuoco acceso nel polo a gennaio
Poi insieme a te abbiamo aggiunto stra all’ordinario
Noi sul pavimento di un ufficio abbandonato
Con le provviste rubate al supermercato
Non abbiamo nulla a parte il nostro entusiasmo

Tu mi ami perché sai che non mi capisci
Voglio che mi stringi come quelle con cui mi tradisci

Lo sai che io ci sono anche se sono in giro
La notte dopo i concerti ti penso fino al mattino
Però durante il giorno io vivo per queste canzoni
E tu sembri cercare il punto in cui si perdono i miei occhi
E vorrei portarti in tourneè con i timbri dei privè
E un parrucchiere nello staff venuto solo per te
Ma a volte diventi cupa, la regina delle tenebre
E hai paura che una fan rubi un pezzo di me
So che è impossibile, io non cambierò per niente al mondo
E ciò che provo adesso è indescrivibile
Quel sogno irraggiungibile adesso è nel mirino
E forse neanche tu capisci quanto è grande il mio obiettivo
Non essere cattivo, noi non possiamo finire
Baby forse ormai è tardi, parto in tour in aprile
E tu che ascolti la canzone e ti piacciono i testi
Se lo sai rispondi ""nei miei panni che faresti, eh?""

Dammi un motivo per pensarti quando sei lontana
Dammi un bacio anche se sono sfatto
Tu mi ami perche sai che non mi capisci
Voglio che mi stringi come quelle con cui mi tradisci

Un motivo per pensarti quando sei lontana
Dammi un bacio anche se sono sfatto
L’odio trionfa e l’amore è soltanto un esca
Spazzati via dal vento come Paolo e Francesca

Poi verrà primavera
E non importa con chi
Il nostro sogno si avvera
Sì, però nostro di chi?

Sono il più odiato dagli addetti ai lavori (too much for me)
Vengo con la mia crew, sono i miei genitori (too much for me)
E in giro non c’è nessuno come me (too much for me)
Non pago le conseguenze sono loro a pagare me (for me)",Io ti ammazzerei
Lowlow,"Dicono che i maschi non piangono
Ma tu lo sai quante lacrime ho versato
Dicono che il successo cambia le persone
Ma tu sai che ero stronzo pure prima e non sono cambiato
Vorrei lasciarti qualcosa oltre ai miei difetti
Oltre i successi raggiunti sputando sangue
Ma non è facile, se ti guardo in effetti
Fra me e te sembri tu quello più grande
Ti ricordi che eravamo piccoletti
Cantavamo le canzoni dei Flaminio Maphia
Io facevo le strofe tu i ritornelli?
Adesso tuo fratello suona in tutta Italia
E anche se non condividi i miei interessi
Io spero che la cosa ti renda fiero
Perché ho fatto di tutto per farmi odiare
Solo scrivendo riesco a dirti: ti voglio bene davvero

A me non piace nulla tranne vendetta e successo
E so che non c’è nulla di nobile in questo
Quindi tu fai qualcosa di importante, che aiuti le persone
Perché io questa volta non ci riesco
Domani ci svegliamo presto, tipo quando vai a scuola
Scuola non serve a niente ma la vita è una scuola
Per me sei grande quindi datti da fare
Non c’è niente di più stupido di sognare

Io so che a sedici anni sei incazzato
Che anche mamma e papà ti sembran nemici
Io lo so che sei diverso dai tuoi amici
Perché pensi più di loro e ti senti un emarginato
Io lo so che a scuola ti senti sprecato
Che a volte sei malinconico e vedi tutto sfuocato
Che tieni le cose dentro e poi non ti sei mai sfogato
Che i più intelligenti soffrono e a volte è un dono ingrato
Ma il mondo è di quelli come me e te
Sei un farfalla pronta a uscire dal suo guscio
E quando prenderai il volo io sarò con te, si
Quando prenderai il volo io sarò con te

A me non piace nulla tranne vendetta e successo
E so che non c’è nulla di nobile in questo
Quindi tu fai qualcosa di importante, che aiuti le persone
Perché io questa volta non ci riesco
Domani ci svegliamo presto, tipo quando vai a scuola
Scuola non serve a niente ma la vita è una scuola
Per me sei grande quindi datti da fare
Non c’è niente di più stupido di sognare

Tu puoi dire ciò che vuoi, è il bello di essere intelligente
E se gira male, c’è sempre un lato divertente
Le ragazze sono belle ma non fotterti la mente
Ricorda che per ogni Eva ci sarà un serpente
E non farti cambiare mai o condizionare dal tuo ambiente
Mamma e papà ci hanno insegnato a pensare liberamente
Può sembrare banale ma fidati non lo è per niente
Qua la religione insegna a pensare poco profondamente

A me non piace nulla tranne vendetta e successo
E so che non c’è nulla di nobile in questo
Quindi tu fai qualcosa di importante, che aiuti le persone
Perché io questa volta non ci riesco
Domani ci svegliamo presto, tipo quando vai a scuola

Lowlow,"Questa è per la nostra terribile educazione
Per ogni notte senza direzione
Per ogni strega che voleva il mio cuore
Ma io un cuore non ce l’ho, ce lo avete di Rick Owens?
Voglio che tu sappia questa è senza strategia
Questa cosa non è né una canzone né una poesia
L’ho scritta per tutti voi ma direi una bugia
Se dicessi che davvero mi manca casa mia
E a volte sei così finto, a volte ti sento vicino
Altre volte ti domandi quando finisce il mio ego
Sapessi quanto male ho fatto al mio migliore amico
Io dentro sono un killer e non so guardarmi indietro
E i bravi ragazzi dormono sereni
Ma alle ragazze piacciamo noi coi problemi
E la mia idea di vissero felici e contenti
Sono io che dormo solo con una borsa di contanti

E a mia mamma non piaci, sei solo un’egoista
Una primadonna fuorviata che gioca a fare l’artista
I miei mi hanno viziato, non c’è che dire
Ma ho cambiato il mio destino soltanto scrivendo rime

Promettimi che un giorno scrivi un pezzo preso bene
Promettimi che un giorno scrivi un pezzo preso bene
Promettimi che per una volta tu scegli il bene
Prometti che in un’altra vita ci vogliamo bene
Promettimi che tu e mia sorella uscirete insieme
Prometti che non tocchi la coca, zio, non fa bene
Perché tutti gli artisti sono persone fragili
E dio benedica le ragazze facili

La donna della mia vita, ti giuro, m’ha rimbalzato
Né il mio swag né tutto questo sfoggiare mi hanno salvato
Ho firmato con la Sugar, giuro, non sono arrabbiato
Spero che lei prenda il mio disco e lo regali al fidanzato
E se ti dicessi che io ho rinunciato alla felicità
Non per la notorietà, ma per essere il migliore
Il re del rap italiano, perché fare lo scrittore era il sogno di papà
E a volte sei così bella, a volte resto indifferente
A volte siamo stelle, a volte ragazzi normali
E a volte sei così bella, a volte resto indifferente
Abbiamo solo sogni e vaffanculo agli ideali
Queste sono le ultime, ho l’ansia da prestazione
Ho scritto tutto questo disco in preda all’emozione
Neanche il mio talento supera la mia ambizione
Il mio rap resurrezione, questa è la mia redenzione

E a mia mamma non piaci, sei solo un’egoista
Una primadonna fuorviata che gioca a fare l’artista
I miei mi hanno viziato, non c’è che dire
Ma ho cambiato il mio destino soltanto scrivendo rime

Perché tutti gli artisti sono persone fragili
E dio benedica le ragazze facili

Voglio dire una cosa e spero non sia troppo lunga
“La verità è che la musica non ha mai salvato nessuno
Tantomeno un uomo che stava per prendere fuoco ma, devo dire
Devo ammettere che la musica e l’arte mi hanno permesso di
Diventare la persona che sognavo di essere da ragazzino”

Morirò senza aver mai baciato una
Urlando come un sordo sotto una luna distratta

Dopo il bosco nero, il sentiero dei nidi di ragno
Quando i grilli canteranno, gli adulti balleranno insieme
Sopra le ossa dei partigiani seppelliti in mezzo al fango

Lowlow,"Conoscevo questo ragazzo, si chiamava Nico
A scuola parlava poco, io lo trovavo fico
Una mattina andavo in banca insieme a mamma
E ho visto Nico entrare e calarsi il passamontagna
“Buongiorno gente, questa è una rapina
Io sono l’ultima persona che vedrete nella vita
A meno che non vi mettete faccia a terra a pecorina
E sarà tutto rapido e indolore come una sveltina
Lasciate i portafogli a terra
Insieme a oro e collanine, io amo tutta quella merda
E se qualcuno si crede un eroe o un cavaliere jedi
Lo farò strisciare per tutta la vita come un millepiedi
Adesso passerò lentamente, avete visto? 
Fate i bravi cagnolini, non succede niente
Siete ubbidienti, voi piccoli bastardi
Chi ha i soldi e non li usa è un ladro, lo diceva Ghandi
Adesso io voglio parlare con il direttore! Sisisisisi voglio parlare con lui
A meno che non voglia lasciare il figlio da solo, solo
Con la povera moglie a piangere con lui
Salve direttore, io mi chiamo Nico
È un piacere incontrare la gente che fa il suo impiego
Ci tenevo a dirle che lei mi fa proprio schifo
E che sua figlia è una cagna, andrebbe bene con un cieco
Ma parliamo d’affari, sì, parliamo d’affari
Tu ora sei il mio schiavo, obbedisci o sparo
Se torni senza aver svuotato le fottute casse
Ti salta testa e ci faccio la rovesciata di Van Basten""

Ho scelto il male perché il bene era banale
Dio m'ha dato una pistola facile da maneggiare
Forse certa gente la deve pagare
Forse io non ho paura di sparare

Stai sanguinando stella? Non fai pena a nessuno
Vuoi sapere perché fumo, perché digiuno?
Vuoi vedere il video di un bambino bullizzato online?
Vuoi sapere che pensavano quelli di Columbine?
Vuoi sapere? Non vuoi sapere, ma io parlo
Sei fortunato, non mi pagano per farlo
Io sono un tarlo, un grillo parlante armato
E adesso saluta i tuoi amici abbronzati di Montecarlo
Vuoi sapere perché la gente non ha più idee?
È perché loro vogliono così
E lo sai qual è la cosa divertente?
È che io parlo di loro, la domanda è “loro chi?”
Perché sono qui? Per provare la violenza
Sulla tua pelle, perché la civiltà è decadenza
E questo è solo un atto di libertà intellettuale
Libertà è dire alla gente ciò che non vuole ascoltare
E prima di entrare, ho chiamato le guardie
Devo fare tutto da solo, anche una sparatoria
E c’hai presente quel frocetto di Andy Warhol?
Quindici minuti e passiamo alla storia!”

Dio proteggi i miei nemici che ne hanno bisogno
Ogni giorno sarò più grande, non fermare il sogno
Dammi solo la forza di rubare un'iride
Perché chi è vincente ora sembrerà invincibile
Ho fatto questo disco solo per mangiarvi in faccia
E il mio nome è così grande che anche dirlo è una minaccia
Lancio l’oro nell acqua e fanculo la fama
Muoio amando il sistema ma anche il sistema mi ama

This talk of paper chase is forcing me to stay awake
Living in sake of cake, yeah, others will say you're straight
Say they got my back and that they're praying Imma pave the way
Like it's the great escape brothers doing better than me
I'm in a hurry worry what if they forget about me?
I'm just another number nothing when the check will bounce
See now we're moving for money, but there's nothing but debt around me

Like apple in the cider she was sipping
We were drunk and she would listen
Longing for the later when you shaded her with kissing
And you coloured all her numbers

Now you sit indifferent
Crippled in the heat
A little brittle from the evils that you speak

Living in this hurry, only worry is my next breath

And end up most raise a toast to the death
Like it's blessed
But the second guess pokes through your chest
'Til you rest where your breddas left wishing you were next
But the best don't, fade
Flicker where the flame blows
The circle still be tighter than some canerows
I feel the pain, never worry if the pain shows
Maybe only reason I be feeling like I paint those images that fit
Quick like the minute that you flip
For your finish feel the ignorance and dip
Still you slip

When every jungle animal is on a feeding frenzy
Fear loathing on this helter skelter
When all we really need is food, clothing and shelter
Played the hand they dealt ya down 'til the last card
You claim king but only jokers have the last laugh
So when alarm bells ring we don't do a thing
But sing, it's sink or swim and the tide is in
Every night is a title bid
You gotta float when you're the butterfly that they're tryna pimp
And pack a sting for those buzzing 'round your honeybee

We ain't in a rush bBut we steady pacing
Chasing payments is a blatant but we're staying patient
Pumping product from this basement trying to make a statement
But ain't nothing changed when I check my statement
Remain determined 'cause the work is being put in
I'm aware of what I'm cooking and the people overlooking
Mastering this recipe before we hand it out
But still living hand-to-mouth
Thought I had it figured out ,what a setback
That time is money that I'll never get back
And yeah I get that but listen if that
No time to dwell, 'cause only time will tell if it works
Flipping verses, filling purses is a gift and a curse
And so I, live for the better and I learn from the worst

Never feel enough
So I back the whole damn glass and never spill a touch
Trust
Still don't change nothing
Same bluffing
Same blame with the same something
Same pain
Spelt her name in the same substance
Shame saying it ain't the same when the rains coming
'Cause there was something about her leaving
Colder for the evening
Had me sober for the feeling, uh
Holding out hope
There's hoping to believe in

Whose world is this? Bruv, of course it's ours
Saying I ain't been the same since I caught the scars
They don't fade, I ain't ashamed
Watch us fall from Mars
Cos it's the fallen parts and all the dust settles
And we all call on ours fast as we pluck petals
We let the love pour into our brain
Another day doing more to maintain
Saying finally those tears in my mother's eyes
Tears from the other side
Tears of joy, her little boy's got his mother's pride
You don't know nothing 'bout the rain 'til you come inside
And watch it trickle past the pane as the summer rise
'Cause ain't no love inside

Except for my mother and my diehards
I stay firm

If I lost yours come and find ours

I've got pleasures
Becoming pressures
They make me want to drift away
They make me want to drift away

I wasn't running from the beast, I was running from myself
Running out of street, she was worried 'bout my health
Wasn't worried it was beef
Wasn't worried it was girls
She was worried it was me and my mother couldn't tell
Something bigger than the world
For me and Ryan
Now he could see that I've been crying
Tell a little lie and say there's something in my eye
And from the second he could see that I've been lying
He would think I wasn't trying
Telling him, look honestly I'm dying
To be the bigger man, the one that you're relying on
I keep it strong
So I tell another lie 'cause it's the only way to keep me from denying
So I tell him brother listen
Listen, when the sun don't glisten
All the days turn grey and the love goes missing
Hate won't fade and the front row hissing
You're the only one that keeps my heart wishing

I've got pleasures

That was me and my Jean
That was me and my Jean

He was a scribble of boy
All hair and mischief
A two-foot tale of trouble
The bee's knees
A cartwheeling chatterbox of tricks
Completely fearless
I had to carry a first aid kit
My band-aid boy
I had my heart in my mouth wherever we went
He'd do backflips into the pool when he was tiny
And the lifeguards would get all stressed out
He was a proper Mowgli
He embraced everything
Took things apart to see what made them tick
Such busy fingers
He would empty sugar packets onto the tables at restaurants to draw pictures in
He used to draw on anything
Fantastical creatures with ferocious fangs
And now he draws with words and I find lyrics on my till receipts and bills
He was never still and barely slept so neither did I
I could never understand how he could watch TV upside down while kicking a ball
His eyes shone with wonder
Music flowed through him like a current
He'd upend a stool to use as a microphone
Singing away for his grandparents
He turned the world upside down and we're richer for it
He was and is a compete joy
The world is his

So we keep it
Keep it out of reach of all the eejits

Best believe it, you won't see it
Locked up in my room
Deep cocoon, like you're digging in crates
Already done with your digging, so your digging is bait

Buzzing 'til late
Sample the greats
Then we move onto the groove
Grabbing that sample at eight

Smooth like new weapons

Tunes through Jimi to Zeppelin

Manoeuvre blasts fast 'cause we're hard to resist
Blitz like it was vital
Recited my recital
One back in the snapple
The snap, the crackle of the vinyl
Sweet onto repeat

You anus
You Ignoramus
Just let me say this
Not the greatest - but gimme space kid, I’m set to make it
So basically we’re bringing it back to basics
Rocking hi-hats and big kicks that are the latest trend
It’s a statement, but when you put this fashion aside

Extinguish all the fire from the liars and the gimmicks
Losing spirit
Bredders putting cheddar over lyrics
Then diminish any vision when they clear it
I hear it, it's happening
Moving like they’re mannequins
Dressed by other brothers
Hiding under covers with mothers be panicking
Rambling
Gassing like they’re Anakin
But red and blue lights are out of sight
On the mic - stop damaging
Your honour and your pride
I, goner from the side
Never dippin' from the rhythm
Flow specific when I rhyme
Sometime tell the flack and back, a slap
To any cracker jack who be slacking his mac
I’m on the track and in my prime

Time if you chose it
Keep your spine straighter then a blind homophobic
Ease your mind - if you hold it

And keep your spine straight tonight (‘night ‘night)

Loyle Carner,"I used to know this nigga Sonny
Who was ironically dark
Never consumed by the money
But selling dro in the park
Became a main habit of his, bagging the piff
Corner copy is copying the man he was blacker than piff
It wasn't simple

Simpler than the previous maturity
Was lacking it
He was never mischievous
Devious was closer
Only relevant if leaving us
He was too afraid so he stayed for us to believe in trust

Honesty was the commodity he never possessed
Never the less
Manipulate a woman beating his chest
Reaping his stress
Sneaking a breath
We can assess
Hear the pitter patter listen and latter
Weeping to death

Without a shoulder to cry on
No one left to rely on
He was followed by some men in black
Like the belt of Orion
In the report
Said he was caught dead in the snort
And was shredded
He never even embedded the thought

Nothing will change until it drains

There's no need to cry, no, no, no
He broke your heart baby
So won't you give my love a try, baby

Girl, why don't you dry your eyes
There is no more need to cry
I won't hurt you like he did
I got so much love to give
What you need is a man like me
Who can give you all you need
You don't have to be sad no more
Love is knockin' at your door

Lovin' hurts baby sometimes
Don't you agree
I promise to love you for life
Girl you will see

He left you lonely
Left you drowning in tears
Yes he did baby
Now when it comes to love, babe
You have nothing but fears
You don't have to be afraid baby, no

I know love has done you wrong
But girl, you must be strong
Girl, just put your trust in me
I'll show you how love should be
I won't do you like he did
I got so much love to give
Girl, would you hold me tight
I'll love you with all my might

Lovin' hurts baby sometimes
Don't you agree
I promise to love you for life

LSG,"No, no, no
How can I express
My apology to you
I know I better pay
For all the things I put you through
Lying 'bout my whereabouts
I don't even take you out no more
So it wasn't a surprise to me
When I found my clothes outside the door

Before you put me out
Girl, please understand
I ain't nuthin' special
I am just a man
Who loves you with all my heart
But I didn't use my head
I swear that I'll be back, girl
So just keep it warm
On my side of the bed
On my side of the bed

I know how I would feel
If you went astray
Thinking 'bout somebody lovin' you
Better than I do, girl
Would make me go insane
Can I have a kiss goodbye
And I'll be on my way
Believe me I'll be on my knees
Beggin' you take me back someday

Before you put me out
Girl, please understand
I ain't nuthin' special
I am just a man
Who loves you with all my heart
But I didn't use my head
I swear that I'll be back, girl
So just keep it warm
On my side of the bed
On my side of the bed

I don't know what I'd do
If I can't spend my time with you
I'll miss calling out your name
It wouldn't be the same
Not waking up and seeing you
To ""show"" beats ""tell"" all day
Girl, I'm gonna find a way
To show you that I changed
And I ain't playing games
I know I gotta leave
But I'll make you believe

Before you put me out
Girl, please understand
I ain't nuthin' special
I am just a man
Who loves you with all my heart
But I didn't use my head
I swear that I'll be back, girl
So just keep it warm
On my side of the bed
On my side of the bed

It's gon' be always my side
Um my, my, my, my, my side
It's gon' be always my side
Um my, my, my, my, my side

There was tears of frustration
Rollin' down my eyes

I don't want to live without

I had all that I wanted

She didn't fuss or complain
And I'm thinking she's fine

Broke that promise she lied

Knew you way before I tips that
First friends, then lovers, undercovers, I plush flats
You copped the bezels that match

That ice your Rolley to the max
Understand for you, I'll be the man, let alone the b****
Let me catch you out cheatin', I'mma cut off your dick

Baby, you sick, this your s***
And I'm a label you mine
Plus you a dime, always shine
Be involved with my crime

We had to grind, never understand it's woman and man
We're from the land to the escalades (n**** get paid!)
Lemonade, Tangaray, never change your ways
'Cause you a dame, keep me sane like a walk in the rain

Taught to the game from my perspective
Had you checkin' for snakes
With a mutual agreement that we in it for cake

This is our world so I'mma ride for you
Would you ride for me?
Would you die for me?

Yeah, I got your back to the end
Boy, over backwards, I bent
Any argument, we commend
When I needed money, you lent

I'll be your lover and friend
You did your dirt then I grew it
I stayed there helpin' you through it
I f***ed up too and you knew it

Many times I thought that you blew it
But then you'd always make it right with me
No fight with me, forever kept it tight with me
Sometimes you ditched the fellas 

Just to come and ride with me
Then stripped me down, licked me up, every night with me
You never made me feel I owed you for the deeds that you done
Re-payed you with my loyalty, promised to give you a son

Can't nothin' come between us ever boy
You know you the one
And love I give you everyday, you know it's second to none

So come and get paid with me, runaway with me
Anytime you need it, come and lay with me
Every day with me, n**** stay with me
Anytime you want it, have your way with me
I'm yours

[Lo...]
For you I'll stack these chips
Keep every gat on spit
Give you the ring, nice things
Without the marriage and s***

You blow the b****, I blow her man
Never expose our plans
Holdin' hands, rockin' Timberlands
Your feminist stance

Got me trance baby
Donna chick, don't f*** with Old Navy
You couldn't pay me to find another lady, load the 380
These hoes is crazy

F*** a daisy when I got me a rose
Chalked up, stock broke, still rock our own shows
Phenominal, me and you
Give you the keys to the coupe

Bubble baths, rub that a**
You'll be squeezin' me too
No need for you to stress out, this n**** holdin' his form
Love my son, I love your daughters Q, Cypress, De'jan

Your man at arms, born the same day, Lo with Sole'

Why no se que es peor
Pero se que es lo mejor
Escuchame que es lo mejor

ven why siente lo q siento
La impotencia de perdernos 
Sin darnos un adios

por que yo no supe amarte
Why tu no supiste pedonarme 
Why no se que es peor
Pero se que es lo mejor
Olvidarnos los dos

Que nuestro amor era
Infinito como el universo
Y hoy se reduce a un verso

No se donde ni como estaré
Ahora que te has ido
Mi corazon se fue contigo
No se, no se que hacer conmigo

Quiero olvidar que algún día
Me hiciste feliz
Pero es inútil fingir
No puedo, no puedo, no puedo
Vivir sin ti

La vida después de ti
Es un castigo sin fin
Y no sobreviviré

Antes y después de ti

Me obligo a vivir en duelo
Y no sobreviviré
Mi recuerdo sin tu recuerdo

Así es la vida, la vida después de ti
Diré que esto no esta matándome
Pero eso no es cierto
Me he vuelto un fantasma eterno
Que habita en tu recuerdo

Y así lo que un día fue ya no
Maldita mi suerte de
Solo en sueños verte
De amarte, de amarte
Y de perderte

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

Lu Campbell,"I was at a dance when he caught my eye
Standin' all alone lookin' sad and shy
We began to dance, swaying' to and fro
And soon I knew I'd never let him go

Blame it on the bossa nova that he did so well
Oh, it all began with just one little dance
But then it ended up a big romance
Blame it on the bossa nova

No, no, the bossa nova

Now I'm glad to say I'm his bride to be
And we're gonna raise a family
And when our kids ask how it came about
I'm gonna say to them without a doubt

Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin

Lu Campbell,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow

Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,
Like a chump playing stud,
If they lost that old ace down in the hole!",Ace in the Hole

In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down

For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love

Lu Watters,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Na minha vida, a timidez sempre falou mais forte
O seu não eu já ganhei, se me esnobar eu saio

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Luan Santana,"Amar é andar de busão no banco de trás abraçado
Amar é comer junto miojo no mesmo prato
Amar é dividir um cachorro quente no bingo
Fingir que é jantar chique que no restaurante granfino

Amar pode ter certeza, não tem nada a ver com dinheiro
Amar é coisa de pele, que quando quer um não tem jeito
Amar é dividir um chiclete que resta no meio
Amar a gente sente de cara no primeiro beijo

Frio, a gente dorme de conchinha num só cobertor
Calor, põe pra rodar, põe no três o ventilador

Isso que é amor, o resto é conversa
Isso que é amor, a gente se olha, se encosta e se pega

Entrou outra em eu lugar
E é só quando eu me deito
Que ela vem me visitar

Insiste muito em me beijar
E eu com delicadeza
Peço pra se afastar

Nem tão pouco me apegar
Nem novelas tenho visto
Da vontade de chorar, de chorar

Tenho medo de acordar de madrugada
E uma luz semi apagada refletir ela pra mim
Sei que está tão curiosa e louca pra me perguntar
Quem está no seu lugar

Luanne Surace,"On the first part of the journey 
I was looking at all the life 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There was sand and hills and rings 
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz 
And the sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound 

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la

After two days in the desert sun 
My skin began to turn red 
After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told of a river that flowed 
Made me sad to think it was dead 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la 

After nine days I let the horse run free 
'Cause the desert had turned to sea 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
there was sand and hills and rings 
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground 
And a perfect disguise above 
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name

Para nosotros la patria es un sentimiento natural, inspirado en realidades sensibles a los cinco sentidos. La patria es la Tierra. La Tierra que nos dio el ser why que nos recogerá en la muerte como semilla de nuevas criaturas. La Tierra que cría flores en los campos para regalo de los ojos why árboles para que canten los pájaros donde encontramos sombra fresca en el verano why cálido cobijo en el invierno, donde sufrimos las inquietudes de las siembras why gozamos la alegría de las cosechas, donde el vendaval brama en las ramas de los robles why silba en las cuerdas de los barcos; donde canta el viento en los pinares, donde rompen las olas en los acantilados de la costa why rugen en los arenales; donde por primera vez vemos la lluvia, la niebla, el sol, la luz de luna, el arco iris why la noche estrellada'.

Un día, bromeando en el estudio sobre su querencia por los cambios de ritmo o las suites de compleja estructura, los integrantes de LNL decidieron grabar un tema enérgico, dinámico why divertido ?que transcurriera igual de principio a fin?. El fruto de aquella determinación son estos dos fugaces minutos de alborozo why buen humor.

In my side.
Can't help it now.
Can you feel it pound?
Can you hear the sound
Of my wild heart?
[Chorus]
Beat like a whisper.
Beat like a drum.
Beat in a place
As big as the sun,
And I will return
If you let me run.
I'm a wild, wild, one.
I need some grace.
I need some
Understanding.
Got to have it.
Got to fill my soul.
And I never knew
That it was in my blood.
I know it might sound silly,
But I
Would never deceive you.
But it is something more
Than just a wild, wreckless,
Upheaval.
And it stings
Like a thorn
In my side.
Can't help it now.
Can you you feel it pound?
Can you hear the sound
Of my wild heart?

Beat like a whisper.
Beat like a drum.
Beat in a place
As big as the sun.

If you let me run.

Oh, I'm a wild heart.
Yes, I'm a wild heart.
Hey, let me run.
Let me run.",Wild Heart

I've got it all figured out
But the head
Does not always rule the heart

Out of body and soul
Just when I thought Id made it

On me
I feel his memory haunting me
Time and Again
I feel weak because

Every time I see your picture I cry
And I learn to get over you
One more time because
Every time I see your picture I cry
Oh I cry

There you rest inside the walls
Of a flame
Hurts so bad
I can almost feel your eyes
Calling out my name and so
Out of body and soul

Time and again
I feel weak because

All in the name of liberty
In the end it shall deliver you
Deliver me from evil arms

We are subjects in life imitating art
The time has come, we wait as one
And if we believe

We can weather all upheavals in unity

Luca Carboni,"Io sono troppo bolognese,
Tu sei troppo napoletano
Egli è troppo torinese
E voi siete troppo di Bari
Sì noi siamo troppo orgogliosi,
Loro sono troppo veneziani
E anche dentro la stessa città,
Siamo sempre troppo lontani!

E siamo sempre troppo romani,
E si che siamo troppo milanesi
E lo vedi anche allo stadio
Che siamo sempre troppo tesi
Siamo tifosi poco sportivi
Perché siamo troppo fiorentini
E la polizia controlla
Che non stiamo troppo vicini!

E allora son troppo bolognese,
Tu sei troppo cagliaritano
Sventoliamo troppe bandiere,
Col bastone nella mano
E diventiamo troppo violenti,
E se non ci spacchiamo I denti
Comunque ci promettiamo in coro
Che ci romperemo il culo!

E io sono troppo emiliano,
Tu sei troppo siciliano
Egli è troppo calabrese,
E voi troppo molisani
E noi siamo troppo chiusi,
Loro son troppo altoatesini
E anche se è caduto il muro,
Abbiamo sempre troppi confini!

E poi eravamo troppo fascisti
E anche troppo menefreghisti
Allora giù botte coi manganelli
Comunque non eravamo troppo fratelli
Poi diventammo troppo comunisti,
E anche troppo democristiani
E sì che il tempo passa
Ma siamo ancora troppo italiani!

Pensi mai ai veicoli di notte
Con il muso piatto
Vanno in giro per la città
Mentre gli autbous
Portano a spasso quella luce fioca
Randagi come cani

Davanti a vecchie fermate, dimenticate
Negli angoli di periferia
Davanti a moto rubate, rubate e buttate
Come questa sotto casa mia

Hey,
Li senti gli autobus di notte
Con certi meccanismi rotti
Fare troppo rumore

In più
Nessuno li sta cercando
Nessuno li sta aspettando
Anche l'autista dimmi, cosa fa

Sono locomotive, su binari morti
Da tempo non si ve don più
Sono le vecchie idee, anche quelle forti
Nessuno ormai le usa

Dimmi
Non ti fanno un po' spavento
O ti fanno tenerezza
Gli autobus di notte

Vuoti,
Anche se inutili, generosi
Anche quelli vecchi e sfatti

Non ti è capitato mai
Di provare rispetto
Per I vecchi motori
Non vorrebbero tradirci mai

Di sorridere un po'
Per quei vecchi motori
Non vorrebbero lasciarci
Che hanno paura
E sono ingombranti
Come I nonni e le vecchie zie

Come tutti quanti
Non vorrebbero mai morire.",Gli Autobus Di Notte

Nel vento dei miei guai

Luca Carboni,"E l'acqua si riempie di schiuma il cielo di fumi
La chimica lebbra distrugge la vita nei fiumi
Uccelli che volano a stento malati di morte
Il freddo interesse alla vita ha sbarrato le porte

Un'isola intera ha trovato nel mare una tomba
Il falso progresso ha voluto provare una bomba
Poi pioggia che toglie la sete alla terra che è vita
Invece le porta la morte perché è radioattiva

Eppure il vento soffia ancora
Spruzza l'acqua alle navi sulla prora
E sussurra canzoni tra le foglie
Bacia i fiori li bacia e non li coglie

Un giorno il denaro ha scoperto la guerra mondiale
Ha dato il suo putrido segno all'istinto bestiale
Ha ucciso, bruciato, distrutto in un triste rosario
E tutta la terra si è avvolta di un nero sudario

E presto la chiave nascosta di nuovi segreti
Così copriranno di fango persino i pianeti
Vorranno inquinare le stelle la guerra tra i soli
I crimini contro la vita li chiamano errori

Eppure il vento soffia ancora
Spruzza l'acqua alle navi sulla prora
E sussurra canzoni tra le foglie
Bacia i fiori li bacia e non li coglie

Eppure sfiora le campagne
Accarezza sui fianchi le montagne
E scompiglia le donne fra i capelli
Corre a gara in volo con gli uccelli

Eppure il vento soffia ancora

",Eppure Soffia
Luca Carboni,"Sta cambiando ancora il tempo,
Il tempo cambia sempre
Ma cambia poco chi c'è dentro.

Questa volta fa bufera
E ha fatto il cielo nero
E sembra fare a chi è più duro
C'è sempre una canzone
Per caso o per fortuna
C'è ancora una canzone
Bagnata un po' nel vino

Mentre infuria la bufera
E il sangue fa il suo giro
Qualcuno urla che era ora,
Le poltrone sono calde
Stani il seduti saldi
Finché lì dentro è solo calma

E sei un particolare
Dentro il quadro generale
Che vorrebbero ma non possono ignorare

C'è sempre una canzone
Per caso o per fortuna
C'è ancora una canzone
Caduta dalla luna
C'è sempre una canzone
Che non fa dormire
C'è ancora una canzone
Ancora da sentire

Mentre la bilancia piega
E non c'è via di fuga
E la giustizia non si spiega,
Mentre è solo mare aperto
E non si vede il porto
Ed il futuro è un po' più corto
E sei un particolare
Che vorrebbero ignorare
E ci riescono se tu li lasci fare

C'è sempre una canzone
Per caso o per fortuna
C'è ancora una canzone
Caduta dalla luna
C'è sempre una canzone
Che non fa dormire
C'è ancora una canzone
Ancora da sentire",C'è sempre una canzone

Ci vuole di non farsi prendere dal panico

L'afflato mistico e il diploma allo scientifico
Il piano B da realizzare quando è sabato
La scarpa giusta e il materasso morbido
Ci vuole un dio che ci protegga quando il gioco si complica
E un po' di pratica con l'informatica
E se si fa drammatica la situazione, ciak, motore, azione

Ci vuole un fisico bestiale
Per stare nel mondo dei grandi
E poi trovarsi a certe cene
Con tipi furbi ed arroganti

Sono timide presenze
Nascoste tra la gente

Abituati ad ascoltare

Che mettono in ordine I pensieri
Persone piene di paura
Che qualcuno possa sapere
I loro piccoli e grandi contraddittori pensieri

All'improvviso scappi via
Senza salutare
I tuoi occhi scendono le scale
Non so cosa vanno a fare

Se a commuoversi o a sognare
Ad arrabbiarsi o a meditare
Ma nell'anima si sa
C'è sempre molto da fare

Sentendo passare di nuovo
I motorini truccati, le autoradio veloci
E il profumo dei tigli
Mischiato ad un altro più strano
Mi fa ricordare
Che da bambino
Sognavo di fare il benzinaio

Di colpo
Oggi come allora la stessa
Fatica a stare in casa
E annusando l'aria di nuovo

Con la stessa smania di allora
Con la stessa voglia di andare

Scappare
Dove non sono stato mai

E' primavera
E mi prende un bisogno di leggerezza
E di pesanti passioni e un sentimento
Indefinibile al tramonto
Dalla finestra guardo il mondo
E mi viene voglia di tuffarmi
Lì dentro
E mi viene voglia di non lasciarlo mai

E' primavera
E torna come allora una voce
Che dice
Lascia ad altri i progetti
Troppo lunghi
Arricchisci il tuo tempo e non cercare

Più del pane quotidiano
Lasciati andare alla vita
E non disperarti mai

Occhio, questa è la palla che ci può salvare

A salvarci erano invece
Certe canzoni
Che uscivano dalla radio di Silvia
Tu seduta a cercare le stazioni
Che buffo era Luca mentre provava
A tenerti la mano
Non potevo a non prendervi in giro ma capivo
Che nasceva qualcosa di strano

Per dimostrarci che aveva coraggio

Per potergli parlare

Si, va beh, ma adesso lasciami andare

Che non può perdere noi

Mentre io spalmo la maionese
Potrei spalmartene un po' sul collo
E leccandoti far tremare Bach

Contro la noia della TV
Guardare solo la pubblicità
Gli spettacoli quelli no
Quelli li faremo noi
E poi dopo aver fatto il bagno
Correre al cinema a vedere un film

Potremmo essere felici e fare un mucchio di peccati
Potremmo essere felici e a volte un poco disperati
Potremmo dirci certe cose da fare accapponare la pelle
Potremmo fare certe cose che ci fucilano alle spalle

Poi potremmo studiare il modo
Per vivere senza lavorare
Studiare l'ora per andare al mare
Decidere per chi votare
Andare in centro con la bicicletta
La bicicletta trallallerullà

E imparare a ballare il tango
Che nella vita serve sempre
Parlare un'ora del colore
Per ridipingere il soffitto
E poi nel silenzio abbassare gli occhi
Cercando nuovi angoli da baciare

Non sanno fare niente

Hanno I maglioni sgualciti
E non guardano nenache la televisione
Tranne la notte degli oscar
E qualche film d'azione

E chi ha perso tutto per scoprirsi a fondo

Che cosa pensano I marziani dei capricci terrestri
E di quegli umani buffi

E si confondono sempre navigando sul web

Mystical energies led him straight there

When they reached the ruins of Ayraklis
Losing their will and conscience
They fell down trapped into a deadly sleep

Raging moving every icy stone
There were their lying bodies
Were now surrounded by ten shy little Gorks

So the miracle saved them
And they woke up again
Thanks to secret and unknown old cures
Based on magic plants
Oh what wonderful creatures...
Only few could see them
Only legends and old fairytales
Describing their cold far white reign

NOW RISE
HEAR THE SAD VOICE OF STARLESS NIGHTS
WARRIORS OF THE NEW CENTURY

CROSS THE COSMIC SHORES OF MORTAL TIME

Rising now from moons of black abyss
Drinking the brew of wild herbs
The special one's growing only on those hills

She was there already cured and happy
Able so to kiss his lips again
But sadly time was running out
And all those fools were going to find their way

So they thanked all those new friends
Leaving that mystic place
Setting off on their journey
Fleeing to reach a safer place
When they came to the white lakes
They could see behind them
That enormous and ancestral black moon
Screaming visual pain...true pain!

WARRIORS OF THE NEW CENTURY
NOW RISE
HEAR THE SAD VOICE OF STARLESS NIGHTS
WARRIORS OF THE NEW CENTURY
NOW RIDE
CROSS THE COSMIC SHORES OF MORTAL TIME
",New Century's Tarantella
Luca Turilli,"[music & lyrics: luca turilli]

Star... light... shine!

They are coming out from the ice
From the furthest deepest caves
Bringing real pain to all...
Leading black death to this world...
Creatures born from ancient fears
Trapped until this new mystic eclipse...
This new eclipse!
Now they know the ancient legend
Was not ramblings of old fools
""...when the fireball will so fall
We'll see a black night without moon...""

From this godforsaken place
Where the enemy has no face
I call the mystic starlight
To enlight my planet damned
In this requiem for my land
My prince of the
Starlight...
Starlght!

In the tragic daily events
There's no place for their true love
Love born from seed unknown...
Arkan's last pleasure and hope...
Cosmic journey of emotions
Between hearts of distant space...
Of distant time...
But the dark fight has to be won
If they want to live their lives
To defend their planet zaephyr
From the threat of deathly ice

From this godforsaken place
Where the enemy has no face
I call the mystic starlight
To enlight my planet damned
In this requiem for my land
My prince of the
Starlight...
Starlght!

Rex tremendae majestis
Qui salvando salvas gratis",Prince of the Starlight
Luca Turilli,"[music & lyrics: Luca Turilli]

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine:
et lux perpetua luceat eis

Silent see of dark and terror
spare the planet from this terror
white cold moon and Zaephyr's surface
Salva me, Salva me, Salva me...
I will swear I will call my hate
and eternal rage

She's ready to turn off her life's flame
to free all his people from hell
but no... he doesn't want to accept thos solution
preferring to think of how he can escape
Hundreds of them are now coming
""friend"" is now an ancient word
there's no place left to hide in this white icy dungeon
no way to survive of the
close shadows' fall
shadows' fall...

And so she made her choice
seeing Arkan fooling himself with lost hopes
She left her lover's arms
and crying she started to run away...
to them!

She looked at him praying... ""forgive me!""
but he could nost answer at all
she was going to be killed by the
mass of those riles
now screaming and trying
to stop all their pain
'cause she would have been surely tortured
by all of those religion's fools
he was then obliged
to shoot at his princess
to avoid the brutality of his now...
dead old friends
She was now lying there
dying in a lake of ice and blood
while he, embracing her
was killing them with his red eyes

WHEN HER BLOOD RAN THROUGH THE DARK ICE
THE SURFACE BEGAN TO TREMBLE
QUAKES AND THUNDERS CLASHING EVERYWHERE
THIS IS ZAEPHYR'S TRAGIC DOOMSDAY
WHAT WAS UNREVEALED SO EVEN
TO THE PROPHET OF THE LAST ECLIPSE...
LAST ECLIPSE

She was now lying there
dying in a lake of ice and blood
oh no... why she's dead now...

No trace of life around
What happened to his ancient town?
He hopes it's not a dream
but it's the sun now lighting him
WHEN HER BLOOD RAN THROUGH THE DARK ICE
THE SURFACE BEGAN TO TREMBLE
QUAKES AND THUNDERS CLASHING EVERYWHERE
THIS IS ZAEPHYR'S TRAGIC DOOMSDAY
WHAT WAS UNREVEALED EVEN
TO THE PROPHET OF THE LAST ECLIPSE...
LAST ECLIPSE

Silent seed of dark and terror
spare the planet from hisd horror
white cold moon and Zaephyr's surface
Salva me, Salva me, Salva me...
I will swear I will call my hate
and eternal rage

Luca Turilli,"Cold darkness reigns on all
It reigns in arkan's soul
Wounded love destined soon to fall
She stays in front of him
Caressed by howling wind
Enemy victim of the unknown

But from her eyes so dark and shy loves rides
Flies so high beyond the stars
Not asking what or why
All happened from her sad coming
It just goes on flying high
To the waves of timeless oceans

He needs no words at all
But she wants him to know
Really what her tortured mind still hides
The truth is even worse
A present with no hope,
Soon to end so hard to accept

But from her eyes so dark and shy loves rides
Flies so high beyond the stars
Not asking what or why
All happened from her sad coming
It just goes on flying high

Cosmic terror of the universe // BEWARE!
Mighty energies of mystic wars // ANGELS CALL
Soon will be born a mortal who will dare

There between two astral worlds
lie dark seeds of eternal war
far beyond the silent holw where
meteors paint a crystal storm
Through the eons without space
where swallowed is the concept: time
Systems burning and colliding
form the chaos, dark and light

Luce,"Karen blows the smoke across the table 
To the seat I'm in 
And blood is passed around in glasses 
â??Vintage year' she says again 

As I sit here choking on my food 
Like words we've swallowed deep inside 
Well there's a polka-dotted dog 
Who keeps barking as the cars go by 

And it's that stupid dog's tail 
That I see us chase 
But she can't see it on my face 

â??Cause I'm home in this electric chair 
â??Cause I'm home in this electric chair 
â??Cause I'm home in this electric chair I'm home 

So we watch the clock tick quietly 
As it syncs itself to our heart beats 
And then Karen stands up with her glass 
And another toast to everyone she cares about 
Everyone she cares about 

And I am really turned on by the fact she cares, 
But she doesn't understand 

That I'm home in this electric chair 
That I'm home in this electric chair 
That I'm home in this electric chair I'm home 

So we sit down as I kiss her goodnight 
And she straps my buckles all down tight 
Upon my cheek she lays her kiss 
Then she plugs me in and throws the switch 

And I'm in my electric chair at home 
In my electric chair at home 
â??Cause in my electric chair I'm home",Electric Chair
Luce,"Well I wake up to a sky so blue 
With my girlfriend in the other room 
Got the coffee on and the pancakes done 
I can't sleep I'm outside in the sun 

The tv sings its morning blues 
And its all the same with all the news 
But she walks up, smiles and kisses me 
And says your coffees done. 

And starts singing.

So I lace my boots up and step outside 
Catch a cab 'cause my car died
And I go to work with my friend Dan 
Paintin houses the best we can 

On my way back home I try and mix it up 
Walk halfway then take a bus 
And as it pulls up and the doors open 
I hear the bus driver say step up please 

Step up. And I'm singing 
Yeah yeah yeah 
And I'm singing yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Some guy looks over and says how ya doin? 

I say Well its a pretty good day

There's a whole world 
And I'm watching all the people 
All the faces and the places I have yet to go 

And the sunshine now its fading 
And my girlfriend she's waiting 
And I bet that she's outside 
Sleeping in the shade 

Cause its a pretty good day

Luce,"It was a dark depressing party until she came into the room
She wore a neon-colored vinyl skirt that brightened up my view
There was a mutual attraction in a woman and a man
But it was me who had the growing situation on his hands

So I just stood there in the middle there, yeah
She moved a little closer, I felt my blood begin to rise
I saw that she was coming over by that look inside her eyes
So I just stood there in the middle there, yeah
I just stood there in the middle there

I just stood there in the middle, wondering where I should put my hands
To cover up arising thoughts of times to come and future plans
And all the while she stood there, staring, baring down on everything
While I just stood there wondering what she could see

So I cursed at mother nature for making me look like such a jerk
I thought of sticks and bricks and pushing pins but nothing seemed to work
Then with the prettiest of smiles she walked up and said ""hello""
Then I watched her as her eyes gazed down on me below
I just stood there in the middle there, yeah
I just stood there in the middle there

I just stood there in the middle, wondering where I should put my hands
To cover up arising thoughts of times to come and future plans

Lucerin Blue,"Get up, it's time to go, the golden door is open 
There is a place on the other side to hide 
I see myself there walking down the path 
I see myself there staring at the sun 
I'm walking out that door 
There's no way I'm staying here 
I never thought I'd go 
But I'm gone and you'll never see me again 
I want to go back 
But sometimes the weather 
Is too cold to stay and I can leave now 
It's too cold outside my lips are starting to freeze 
It's too cold outside my eyes are starting to bleed",Cold
Lucerin Blue,"Are we just wasting time? 
Or should we give up and die? 
Are we a voice withoug words? 
The limit always seems to be the sky 
All the bodies shut their minds 
Let me say won't you please find me 
No we're not wasting time 
And no we shouldn't give up and die 
You gave us a voice and we've got words 
It's time to rise up against 
The tide of words that kill 
Delete the lies 
See his eyes, not compromise",Find Me
Lucerin Blue,"I'm going to seek you like a freight train 
Flying through the night 
I'm about to take flight 
'cause I've found the light 
I'm moving forward in what I know is real 
Gonna do this no matter how I feel 
I'm going to find you like a lost cause 
Searching for release 
From the pain that has binded me like a disease 
Realize, can't live less the love of God 
Come on what else, you know there's nothing 
So comfortable we sit and watch our lives go to waste 
So comfortable we sit and watch our world fall away 
I'M NOT FALLING AWAY! 
I can't do this anymore 
Sitting in my lawnchair drinking lemonade 
In this superstar lifestyle that I've made 
My comfort level seems to be always on the rising 
It's North America, it's not surprising 
I can't do this anymore, Watch my world fall away 
I can't do this anymore, Watch my life go to waste 
Time and Time again, you want to make Amends 
you want to battle the Ax 
you want to battle the Max",Superstar

Tanto, como mercurio derramado
Tanto, como salvaje aroma de limón

Sensación de caminar con pies desnudos
Sobre la nieve primera
Del invierno sin tener porque marcarnos metas
Tu me quieres yo te amo sin descanso
Para que necesitamos
Bendiciones de papel con las que atarnos

Tanto, que duele solo de pensarlo
Tanto, que no podría respirar sin ti

Tanto, tan alocadamente te amo
Tanto, que todo tiene ya sabor a ti

Mientras el crujido casi cotidiano
De la madrugada crece
Desvelándonos con hartos miedos y sirenas
Me susurras al oído frases tiernas
Y tus dedos me diseñan
Mapas-mundis que me hacen perder la cabeza

Tanto, que no me queda ya ningún pudor

Fue sencillo enamorarse, tan sencillo
Amansar tus ojos turbios",Tanto

En el fondo son iguales
Desde un cuarto de hotel

Madre, hoy que vivo sin fronteras
Siempre en una carretera
Sin dejar de correr

Tantas piedras como flores
Tantos plenos como errores igual
Si fui quien eligio esta vida
Soy quien tiene que vivirla
Hasta el final

Madre, trabajar suele ser duro
Pero creo en el futuro
Nunca voy a parar

Nadie le regala nada a nadie
Tener exito no es facil
Tienes que pelear

En cada paso voy dejando
Un pedazo de mi misma detras
Entre aciertos y fracasos
Ni un momento te he dejado de pensar

Quieras o no cada día soy mayor
Y hoy por hoy las compañías
Aunque no te gusten mira
Me las elijo yo

Quieras o no en las cosas del amor
Ya no soy aquella niña
Que sin ti andaba perdida
Se muy bien donde voy

Gracias, pero no me falta nada
Como bien y sigo flaca
Que mas puedo pedir

Calma, el sermon de la montaña
A las tres de la mañana
No me va convertir

Duermo seis horas al menos
Sigo sin fumar no bebo jamas
Voy alerta si manejo
Y aunque lejos no te dejo de pensar

Quieras o no
Cada dia soy mayor

Madre, aunque sea un poco tarde
Llamo para desearte
Felicidades mamá

Quien soy yo para soñar con beber  el aire que respiras
Y ofrecerte el sol o mi piel a tiras te lo acepto

Se que busco problemas, que tengo que claudicar
Y también se que te amo, como no te debo amar
Ponme los pies en el suelo y di que no soy tu amor
Solo una mas entre tantas para nada una excepción

Que es nuestro el mundo si estamos juntos

Y que nada te hace efecto para curar el dolor

Si me extrañas si sientes que no puedes
Llevar el mundo a cuestas
Vuelve conmigo mi amor, si me extrañas

Amores perfectos, no son humanos
Son como nubes, bajo el hielo, ooh

Went and who´s this stranger in my room

Don´t waste my time
So wrapped into you
Baby If the feelings gone
No juegues con mi corazón

Don´t waste my time
With a a heart that´s untrue
´Cause baby if I´m not the one
No juegues con mi corazón

Your love was so magical
That´s  why I´m so hooked on you
Your words were so sensual
And like a fool baby
I believed you it all went wrong
When you lied to me
´Cause I heard her on the phone If you
Don´t have  no respect for me
Then it´s time for  you to go

Don´t waste my time

Don´t waste my time

Do you feel it when we´re marking love
The way I do boy I put everything
I have into loving you
Do you remember the first time we
Touched I thought we were meant to be together",Don't Waste My Time
Lucero,"Tanta pasión en silencio
Desbordo mi mente al pasar
Eras real sangre fría
Te gaste de tanto mirar

Por mi, por mi
Te pediría

Matame toma mis venas
Matame no tengas compasión

Matame de un boca en boca
Matame si ya me toca
Matame apunta al corazón

Tus ojos dicen que si
Tu labios dicen que no
Tus manos dicen simplemente que lo que pase paso

Mi mente dice no se
Mi alma dice quizá
Pero al sentirte
Todo mi cuerpo me grita ya ya

Matame solo un poquito
Matame por un ratito
Matame no tengo salvación

Matame roba mi vida
Matame que estoy perdida
Matame con premeditación

From these waters that run so deep
From these southern ways and lazy heat

Broken vocal chords and busted lips

Sleep in my car where I was to wait
She tapped on the glass
Together at last
With the girl I missed
And it really don't get any better than this
No better than this

On the dirt and the snow out in new Mexico
We were half way between
The south and the sea
At a motel 6
And it really don't get any better than this

Said our goodbyes

Jukebox don't know it's the graveyard shift 
It shakes rattles and rolls 
Since the night that I lost my heart 
The sad songs are all I know 

Waitress brings me a coke 
Calls me darlin 
I think about my girl 
Drinking coffee smoking her Camel wides 
She was the sweetest thing in the world

I lost my heart by those neon lights 
At the Starlite Diner one November night 
I thought I could make it but now 
I see that I might die 
All alone, my heart gone, here at the Starlite

That I was good enough to make you forget

Your head on my chest I held you so tight 
I don't care what they have to say 

Our feet were too drunk to keep step in time 
But we held fast and we made it just fine 
Hell you smiled a lot you smile a lot 

Chairs on the tables they're mopping the floors 
We were still dancing just like before 
You held me tight you held me tight

And hate inside of me
To keep me warm, it keeps me warm
Can't settle for nothing less

Since I was born, since I was born

(?) In what ways if I may not always been right (?)
Well I want nothing, that ain't truly mine
If I could I would stop caring
But I don't like hearing
I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

Seemed the right thing to do
And you called me a fool
Said I'd come back mean and cruel
I said I just wanted to make my grandfather proud

Been gone since, I was thirteen
I'm still worried what he'd think about me
Playing this guitar just ain't gonna cut it, for long
I mean singing these songs don't compare to what he did over there
Need to prove I can carry my share
Take on my own load and bear

She says 'I'll see you when you get home'

She sat back down and waited til he came over to talk. 
Later on that night she was walking out the door. 
Benny starting up his bike the boys came out for more. 
They picked her up and put her on the back of benny's bike. 
Now kathy's been with benny bauer ever since that night. she's tried to leave him many times but can't quite get away. 
She's seen more jails and courts and lawyers than she'd like to say. 
But benny's always been a fighter that'll never change. 
Kathy takes him home and heals him up all the same. 
He'd made it from the clubroom all the way out to the street. 
They'd beat him with the barstools but he made it on his feet. 

kathy's running to her boy, picks him up and takes him home, 
Benny's saying girl I'm sorry. baby you don't know. 

at a bar they call the stoplight the fellas drink their beer. 
The women with their hair done up they make it very clear 
Which one of the fellas is all theirs and can't be touched, 
But that don't mean the motorcycle riders just give up 
On talking to the pretty ladies every one they can. 
Never seen the trouble caused all by just one dance. 
If benny don't get himself shot tonight he'll wish that he had when he gets home. 

so kathy's dating benny and he keeps her by his side.

Riders line up bsas out on the scramblers track. 
Levis jeans and leather jackets number their backs. 
Benny's bike's too big big to race in the two-fifty class. 
They make him start way up on the hill out by the railroad tracks. 
Tomorrow they'll all ride across the illinois state line 
To the motorcycle blessing at the st. christopher shrine. 

kathy's walking out the door.

Benny's crying kathy please 
Baby don't you go. 
Kathy do you mean it this time? 
Just leave him in the middle of the night?

Me and a bunch of boys from home
January '43, drove out to Pine Bluff and signed on
Went to basic south of Birmingham
Put me on west coast bound train
Spent three days out in San Diego
And they shipped me back east again
Left a port out of New York
Slept for months in british rain
Tore it up down in London town
And they shipped me back out again

The preacher said “Boys he who is killed tonight will dine with the Lord in Paradise”
One boy spoke up, said “preacher come on, eat your supper with us

Never talk about those first days
Lots of friends left behind
But I made it all the way across France
And I fought at the Maginot line
Road a tank into Belgium
Like them better than the French
Like my daddy, thirty years before
I did my time in a trench
Lots of days there's no water
But the liquor kept me warm
The cellars were stocked to the ceiling with booze
So I carried a bottle with my gun

The preacher said “Boys he who is killed tonight will dine with the Lord in Paradise”
One boy spoke up, said “preacher come on, eat your supper with us”

Three times I made sergeant
I'm not that kind of man
And pretty much just as quick as I could
I get busted back to private again
Cause takin' orders never suited me
Giving them out was much worse
I could not stand to get my friends killed
So I took care of myself first
Now I know that don't sound right
Don't think too bad of me
Now it keeps me up nights
What I could have done differently

The preacher said “Boys he who is killed tonight will dine with the Lord in Paradise.”
One boy spoke up, said “preacher come on, eat your supper with us”

I'd be no guest at the table of the Lord
His food was not to be mine
‘Cause I cursed His name every chance that I could
And I recon that's why I'm still alive",The War

Well alright.

Lucero,"Five sisters and she's the one
More beauty than the setting sun

They strapped half stacks to roof racks and drove to the parties
Nothing like home with the cold summer nights
They played songs for the girls and they drank till daylight

Sunk my heart at the bottom of the bay
Gonna wash up on the black rocks one day
Like unlucky sailors just swept out to sea
I think all the girls I've loved walked through your streets
But the waves and the fog always took 'em from me

The Oakland apartments with the bars underneath 'em
The girlfriends and sweethearts and the bay in between 'em
I buried my heart at the bottom of the hill

We followed our instincts 
In the worst kind of ways

She talks the whole night
Never says what she means

Lucero,"The family's been here for
The last hundred years
And it's all that he's ever known
Life in the cotton fields
Swamps and the rolling hills
Always called Arkansas home
But when the war came
Like his father before
He joined the army
And went to the war
Leaving the rolling hills
Swamps and the cotton fields
Bound for a Normandy shore
The patch that he wore on
His uniform
Was both blue and grey
The colors of men who died
Fighting another fight
And more would die today
At Omaha beach against Germany
A young country boy
Struggled out of the sea
Up on the sand where
Many a man
Would never know victory
Fought the entire time
Up on the front line
It was lonely, bloody and cold
The only relief he'd find
Might be some old French wine
The water was all dirty and froze
But he was luckier than some
A better soldier than most
He came back from Europe
But never got home
Now he's back on the farm
But not out of harm
He drank so the pain wouldn't show
Well he left behind
My brothers and I
We never really knew him at all
I barely remember him
Smoking with a grin
But looking mean; standing tall
Well I can only hope
That he wouldn't be ashamed
Of the man I become
And the life that I made
And he did the hardest part
And lived life with all his heart
And I hope I don't let him down

But she's cold and tragic too

So I dare not to sail anymore

But I'd act like it 'til I puked or passed out
Oh most nights I could get away with something
These days I don't seem to stand so proud

She asked me why can't I just stop drinking
Come on babe, we both know it's too late
Oh for either one of us to still be thinking
That I could live my life some other way

Angry at the world and all alone
I want you to know darling
I love you and I want to come back home

It was less than graceful ladies I've said we'll see
I've drank with scoundrels, tramps and god damn fools
Oh but I don't think that much care if it kills me
Living life the mans just passing through

The last few years were stitched with floss and pipe dreams
A quilt of poor intentions raveled out
Oh but it was you who took me in and saved me
It seems I've paid you back with slack and broken vows

And I woke up in New Orleans
Angry at the world and all alone
I want you to know darling
I love you and I want to come back home

I know it should have been easy
Its too late to change the path I chose
This might not count for nothing

No sé si tú también lo habrás hecho
Pero tus familares de plano
Siempre me ven con triste desprecio

Pero qué tal si te compro 
Para llevarte conmigo
Te llevos lejos, muy lejos 
Para perderme contigo

Pero yo no te quiero hacer daño
Quiero que seas feliz y dichosa
Pero tus familiares de plano
Nunca te dejarán ser mi esposa

Pero qué tal si te compro 
Para llevarte conmigo
Te llevo lejos, muy lejos 
Para perderme contigo

Nadie me puede ver en tu casa 
Todos me miran con gran desprecio
Dicen que yo no valgo la pena 
Pa ' merecer tu amor y tus besos

Pero qué tal si te compro 
Para llevarte conmigo 
Te llevo lejos, muy lejos

Lucha Villa,"Han nacido en mi rancho dos arbolitos, 
Dos arbolitos que parecen gemelos, 
Y desde mi casita los veo solitos, 
Bajo el amparo santo y la luz del cielo. 

Nunca están separados uno del otro, 
Porque así quiso Dios que los dos nacieran, 
Y con sus mismas ramas se hacen caricias, 
Como si fueran novios que se quisieran. 

Arbolito, arbolito, bajo tu sombra, 
Voy a esperar que el día cansado vuelva, 
Y cuando estoy solito, mirando al cielo, 
Pido pa' que me mande una compañera. 

Arbolito, arbolito, 
Me siento solo, 
Quiero que me acompañes, 
Hasta que muera.",Dos Arbolitos
Luche,"Dicesti “Sai, non vivo bene gli abbandoni
Ti prego non lasciarmi qui”
Ho un’ossessione con gli aquiloni
Odio vederli volare via
Chiesi a mio padre se se ne stava andando
E lui mi rispose “Sì”
Sai ch’è l’unica cosa che mi distrugge
E tu hai fatto proprio quella lì
Mi hanno sempre detto “Ama un po’ di meno”
Mi sono chiesto se sai chi sono davvero
Ho cancellato le tue foto, tranne una che ridi e guardi il cielo
Perché voglio ricordarti senza veleno
La finestra in cui fumavi
Come toglievi i pantaloni
Nessuno ci avrebbe scommesso
Infatti poi hanno vinto loro
Oppure alla fine ci siamo arresi noi
So che ci sei ancora, che mi pensi
So che non amerai per molti anni
Il tuo sguardo prima della porta chiusa
Forse volevi dire “Non è troppo tardi”
Perché cancellare il passato quando possiamo accettarlo?
Perché odiare l’altro quando possiamo aiutarlo?
Vieni da me se ne hai bisogno
Tappiamo la bocca dell’orgoglio
Volevo darti un bambino che avesse i tuoi occhi
Ma fargli vedere cose diverse dalle mie
Portarlo su in un paese dei balocchi dove l’amore esiste senza magie
Ma non riesco a non pensare a come stai
A come sono stati questi mesi senza me
Cerca di mettere da parte le paure
Pensa a quando ero al limite
Quando dormivo per non vivere
Tu mi hai visto in ginocchio senza vestiti
Balliamo un lento per sentirci uniti
Gli uomini come me hanno una missione
Vogliono sentire il nome urlato forte
L’illusione di vivere oltre la morte
Sono amici di sconosciuti, non fanno colazione
E trovano magia nel far volare via un aquilone

Io vendevo roba in strada, roba in strada
E la pioggia mi lavava, mi lavava
Ma bruciava come lava, come lava
E la fantasia mi salvava, mi salvava 
Io vendevo roba in strada, roba in strada
E la pioggia mi lavava, mi lavava
Ma bruciava come lava, come lava
E la fantasia mi salvava, mi salvava 
Tu conserva il mio ricordo 
Tu conserva il mio ricordo 
Tu conserva il mio ricordo 
Tu conserva il mio ricordo

La paura di restare soli senza un padre
Il momento del rifugio nelle braccia di una madre
Mi hai dato i tuoi occhi e mi dicesti di guardar lontano
Ma prima guardami bene perché sto invecchiando
Perché non mi vuoi bene, forse non sono abbastanza?
Qual'è la canzone in sottofondo quando pensi nella stanza?
Corriamo via su una spiaggia così seguiranno i passi
Per trovare il nostro rifugio e il posto in cui ci siamo lasciati
Non avrai mai un po’ di rispetto se non ti confessi
L’unico modo di nascondersi è mentire a sé stessi
Scusa se non sono stato molto bravo nel spiegarmi
Volevo perdermi per ritrovarmi una persona di cui fidarmi
E ho provato così tanto dolore da abituarmi
E stare male ogni volta che ho pensato che ho fallito ad amarti
Volevo solo amore, volevo esprimermi 
Sentirmi libero per non uccidermi
Volevo essere il vento della California
Volevo essere il tramonto nel deserto
Volevo essere il proiettile di John Lennon
Volevo essere il microfono di Malcolm X
Volevo essere il blues di Chicago
Volevo essere il Jazz di New Orleans
Volevo essere la sabbia nel costume
Volevo essere il sale nei capelli
Addormentarmi con la testa sulla tua schiena
Mangiare polvere a pranzo ed unghie a cena
Volevo cancellare tutte le umiliazioni
E non aver paura di esser buoni
Volevo che ai tuoi occhi fossi qualcuno
Il nostro tempo non ce lo darà mai più nessuno

Io vendevo roba in strada, roba in strada
E la pioggia mi lavava, mi lavava
Ma bruciava come lava, come lava
E la fantasia mi salvava, mi salvava 
Io vendevo roba in strada, roba in strada
E la pioggia mi lavava, mi lavava
Ma bruciava come lava, come lava
E la fantasia mi salvava, mi salvava

There is no heart so torn
That it cannot restore

I can hear the faucet drippin' in the kitchen down the hall
I just sit here wishin' there was something I could say
To the one that I keep missing every night and every day

There's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Now I got used to tenderness, we'd hold each other tight
And I got used to happiness, we'd make love day and night
And I'll get used to mornings, eating breakfast all alone
Sitting in the evenings, when there's no one else at home

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Without you the sun still rises, without you the rivers run
I thought by now that I'd be realizing, what's done is done

I accept the notion that there's things you can't control
The changing of the seasons or the fact we're growing old
And I know I'm the reason that you had to go away
But I will keep believing that's the price I have to pay

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

You're a question mark coming
After people you watched collide
You can ask what you want to the satellite

Put ice in my veins
And for all you know you're the only one
Who finds it strange

When they call it a lover's moon

'Cos it acts just like lovers do

A burned out world you know
Staying up all night

'Cos the names you drop
Put ice in my veins
And for all you know you're the only one

Luciana Souza,"If he loved you like I love you
I would walk away in shame
I'd move town, I'd change my name

When he watches you
When he counts to buy your soul
On your hand his golden rings
Like he owns a bird that sings

When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

The priest has said my soul's salvation
Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep the faith in my fashion

When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
I'm still in love with you
(I'm gonna find a place to live, give you all I've got to give)
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

If I could break down these walls
And shout my name at heaven's gate
I'd take these hands
And I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate

Cathedrals are broken
Heaven's no longer above
And hellfire's a promise away
I'd still be saying, I'm still in love

He won't love you
Like I love you
He won't care for you this way
He'll mistreat you if you stay

Come and live with me
We'll have children of our own
I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife

When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

I'm gonna love you more than life
If you will only be my wife
I'm gonna love you more than life
If you will only be my wife
I'm gonna love you night and day
I'm gonna try in every way

I had a dream last night
I dreamt you were by my side
Walking with me baby
My heart was filled with pride
I had a dream last night

",When We Dance
Luciana Souza,"Once again, all alone
I stayed too long or I left too soon

Drapes are drawn
On my sad little throne
Some lines were crossed
In our warm borrowed room

After the actors left our party
And all sweet illusions were gone
One more drink, the bottle's empty

One more word, the deed is done
One bad move out of many
One more war won't be won

Our best work
We've done our part
Our hopeless dreams
Of an open heart

It's getting late
Let's go to bed
It's all been played
And it's all been said

After the actors left our party
And all sweet illusions were gone
One more drink, the bottle's empty

One more word, the deed is done
One bad move out of many
One more war won't be won

Once again, all alone
I stayed too long or I left too soon

Luciano,"Got to leave town, got to get out of here
Here and now pack my bags already
Sunday morning's coming and I'm ready to go
Say goodbye to the neighborhood
Even if they could they'd never understood

You see I'm sick and tired of staying away, oh yeah
So I've made up my mind
I won't waste no more time, I won't linger behind
Got to get away, yes, I just feel like moving
On and on and on, yeah, oh well

I've been thinking about sweet river
Diving off the bridge in my woolen shorts
Contemplating how my life would be
Living like the wind that blows about the sea

Yes, I'm sick
I'm tired of staying away, oh yeah
So I've made up my mind
I won't linger behind, I won't waste no more time

Got to get away
I just feel like moving

I just feel like moving on and on and on, oh girl

By all means I must be free
Taunting me, haunting me
I got to find tranquility

Got to get away
I just feel like moving on and on and on
I just feel like moving on and on and on, yeah

Thirty, forty, forty five and fifty
I will be cruising gently on the Kings Highway
I like the vibes in my 1985
Listening reggae music on the radio

I'm leaving behind the saddest of times, oh yeah
I'm going to find a peace of mind, oh yeah

With his head in his hand

Luciano,"See that broken hearted man
Toiling in the burning sun
Disappointed African
Doesn't even over stand

After so many years of sweat and tears
Still he's living in fear
Wondering if and when
He's gonna have his share

A new day's dawning
See the black son's rising
Soon he will be free

See that poor disgruntled youth
Trying his best to know the truth
Why his ancestors have died
From those all who robbed and ruled

So many years of blood and stain
Still he's working in vain
Wondering if and when
He'll ever have his share

Well, guess what's happening

For getting on with your day

Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
A time for curling hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear

Here she comes, oh oh
Heads turn around
Here she comes
To take her crown

Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell
Is there a time for different colors
Different names you find it hard to spell

Is there a time for first communion
A time for East Seventeen
Is there a time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen

Here she come, oh oh
Beauty plays the clown
Here she comes
Surreal in her crown

Dici che il fiume
Trova la via al mare
E come il fiume
Giungerai a me
Oltre i confini
E le terre assetate
Dici che come fiume
Come fiume
L'amore giungerà
L'amore
E non so più pregare
E nell'amore non so più sperare
E quell'amore non so più aspettare

Is there a time for tying ribbons
A time for Christmas trees
Is there a time for laying tables
And the night is set to freeze",Miss Sarajevo [Live]
Luciano Pavarotti,"Granada, tierra soñada por mi

Mi cantar, se vuelve gitano cuando es para ti.

Mi cantar, hecho de fantasía.

Mi cantar, flor de melancolía 

Que yo te que vengo a dar.

Granada, te ví ensangrentada en tarde de toros.

Mujer que conserva el embrujo de los ojos moros.

Te sueño rebelde gitana cubierta de flores

why beso tu boca de grana,

Jugosa manzana que me habla de amores.

Granada, ""manola"" cantada en coplas preciosas.

No tengo otra cosa que darte que un ramo de rosas.


De rosas de suave fragancia
Que le dieran marco a la Virgen morena.
Granada tu tierra está llena 
De lindas mujeres de sangre why de sol..

Luciano Pavarotti,"Holy Mother, where are you?
Tonight I feel broken in two.
I've seen the stars fall from the sky.
Holy mother, can't keep from crying.

Oh I need your help this time,
Get me through this lonely night.
Tell me please which way to turn
To find myself again.

Holy mother, hear my prayer,
Somehow I know you're still there.
Send me please some peace of mind;
Take away this pain.

I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you.

Holy mother, hear my cry,
I've cursed your name a thousand times.
I've felt the anger running through my soul;
All I need is a hand to hold.

Oh I feel the end has come,
No longer my legs will run.
You know I would rather be
In your arms tonight.

When my hands no longer play,
My voice is still, I fade away.
Holy mother, then I'll be
Lying in, safe within your arms.",Holy Mother
Luciano Pavarotti,"I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out of the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

And his promise made was never clear
It just carve itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my hand
On the night he said to me

Someday
We'll live like horses
Free rein
From you old iron fences
There's more ways than one
To regain your senses
Break out the stalls
And we'll live like horses

We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the tribe
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of the wagon train
On the road to the golden gate
On the flat dry dessert I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now I shall be free

Someday
We'll live like horses
Free rein
From you old iron fences
There's more ways than one
To regain your senses
Break out the stalls
And we'll live like horses",Live like horses

Luciano Pavarotti,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene, sai
È una cantena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un'elica

Sentì il dolore nella musica
Si alzò dal pianoforte 
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte

Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvisso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette d'affogare

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene, sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono i pensieri

Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica

Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway

Much, much more 
I did it, I did my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
And to say the things that he truly feels
And not the words of someone who kneels
And the record shows

Promises made, every memory saved
Has reflections in my mind

Luciano Pavarotti,"Sussurra il vento come quella sera
Vento d?aprile di primavera
Che il volto le sfiorava in un sospiro
Mentre il suo labbro ripeteva giuro
Ma pur l?amore é un vento di follia
Che fugge... come sei fuggita tu.

Vento, vento
Portami via con te
Raggiungeremo insieme il firmamento
Dove le stelle brilleranno a cento
E senza alcun rimpianto
Voglio scordarmi un giuramento
Vento, vento
Portami via con te.

Tu passi lieve come una chimera
Vento d?aprile di primavera
Tu che lontano puoi sfirarla ancora
Dille ch?io l?amo e il cuore mio l?implora
Dille il ch?io fremo dalla gelosia
Solo al pensiero che la baci tu.

Vento. Vento
Portami via con te
Tu che conosci tutte le mie pene
Dille che ancor le voglio tanto bene
Sotto le stelle, chiare
Forse ritornerá l?amore
Vento, vento
Portami via con te.

Sussurra il vento come quella sera
Perché non torni é primavera.

Si potrebbe cantarla più forte

Stanno aspettando
Dedicato a tutti quelli che
Rimangono dei sognatori
Per questo sempre più da soli
Se bastasse una grande canzone
Per parlare di pace
Si potrebbe chiamarla per nome
Aggiungendo una voce
E un'altra poi e un'altra poi
Finche diventa di un solo colore più vivo che mai
Dedicato a tutti quelli che
Sono allo sbando
Dedicato a tutti quelli che
Hanno provato ad inventare
Una canzone per cambiare

There you find the heroes alive protecting the innocents
Bless them all 'cause their simple song is so pure and wonderful

Va pensiero sull'ali dorate
Life's beautiful dream carry on for all night long

Lead them your golden wings every feel will fly away
Take them by the hand help them find an easy way
Lead them back to the light back to the light
Where they once used to belong
Where they carry me children as long as they want

Reach the land find the place where all children grow

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

In time you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you",Hero

Se si canta in due
Passa meglio

Ci facciamo un po'

Luciano Pavarotti,"De mi tierra bella, de mi tierra santa
Oigo ese grito de los tambores
Y los timbales al cumbanchar
Y ese pregón que canta un hermano
Que de su tierra vive lejano
Y que el recuerdo le haré llorar
Una canción que vive entonando
De su dolor de su propio llanto
Y se le escucha penar

La tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma, cuando tú no estás
La tierra te empuja de raíz y cal
La tierra suspira si no te ve más

La tierra donde naciste no
La puedes olvidar, porque tiene tus raíces
Y lo que dejas atrás

Siguen los pregones, la melancolía
Y cada noche junto a la luna
Sigue el güajiro entonando el son
Y cada calle que va a mi pueblo
Tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
Tiene nostalgia como su voz
Y esa canción que sigue entonando
Corre en la sangre y sigue llegando
Con más fuerza al corazón

Tiene un quejido, mi tierra
Tiene un lamento, mi tierra
Nunca la olvido, mi tierra
La llevo en mi sentimiento, si señor
Oigo ese grito, mi tierra
Vive el recuerdo, mi tierra
Corre en mi sangre, mi tierra

La llevo por dentro como no
Canto de mi tierra bella y santa
Sufro ese dolor que hay en su alma
Aunque estoy lejos yo la siento
Y un día regreso yo lo sé",Mi Tierra
Luciano Pavarotti,"I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on

No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know  no matter what 

If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say 

[Chorus]

And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us 
I'll be everyone you need 
No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is 
My life began with you 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not

I know this love's forever

Se quel guerrier

Io fossi! se il mio sogno

S'avverasse!... Un esercito di prodi

Da me guidato... e la vittoria... e il plauso

Di Menfi tutta! E a te, mia dolce Aida,

Tornar di lauri cinto...

Dirti: per te ho pugnato, per to ho vinto!

Mistico serto di luce e fior,

Del mio pensiero tu sei regina,

Tu di mia vita sei lo splendor.

Il tuo bel cielo vorrei redarti,

Le dolci brezze del patrio suol;

Un regal serta sul crin posarti,

Ergerti un trono vicino al sol.

Sono pazzo, e le sono di te

Ed anche se ci sei, vorrei tu fosse qui
E quando te ne vai, sei ancora qui con me
Perche sei bella da morire
E nulla al mondo mai cidivider
Sei l'aurora, sei l'arcobaleno per me
E pur di averti, io t'inventerei

A volte io vorrei ti allontanassi
Per godere in quel momento quando tu ritornerai
Sentire quella gioia come un bimbo
Che oggi a scuola non andr
Ed una vitano bastare non mi pu
Per dirti tutto ci che vibra nel mio cuor
Ma in tre minutti di questa arietta
Ti convincer che sei tutto per me",Ti adoro

On the road to my horizon

And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon

Lucie Arnaz,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Throwing caution to the wind

Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin

Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?

Our lives might change with everything we do
But I know now
I can't take this chance away from you
When you love I cry
See the truth I hide
When I'm slowing down
You can keep running for miles
This isn't like me, this isn't like me

Your light's so bright for everyone to see
Keeping you to myself is an impossibility
And with every step you're moving further away from me
But I can't seem to let go
And love you selflessly

And I know how
Our lives might change with everything we do
But I know now
That I can't take this chance away from you
When you love I cry
See the truth I hide
When I'm slowing down
You can keep running for miles
This isn't like me

There's no reason for this pain
I bring it on myself
Coz nobody else shows the light you do
And its not like me to try to hold you back
You keep on running

I can't take this chance away from you

Lucie Silvas,"Without you, I have room to breathe 
And if I'm weak then you can't see my insecurities 
Without you, I can do what I choose 
'Cause when you got no one to love you got nothing to lose 

Will there come a time, when my head finds it easier to not think about this? 
And I would do any thing to stop the weight of my heart getting heavier 
My only conclusion is 

(That) Nothing compares to you 
No matter where I look 
No matter what I do 
'Cause that garden of eden you took me to 
Is now overgrown 
And the love I've known 
Is gone without you 

Is gone without you 

Without you, I can kid myself 
That my idea of perfect love is not a fairytale 
Without you, I don't need to explain 
There's no one to answer to and I got, no one to blame 

I can do my thing, cause who cares what tomorrow brings 
When you got nothing to miss 
And every time I hide in the arms of another I realise 
It still comes to this 

(That) Nothing compares to you 
No matter where I look 
No matter what I do 
'Cause that garden of eden you took me to 
Is now overgrown 
And the love I've known 
Is gone without you 

What is the flower that never blooms 
What's the night sky without its moon 
If I'm the music you're the tune 
Don't hear a sound here without you 

'Cause Nothing compares to you 
No matter where I look 
No matter what I do 
'Cause that garden of eden you took me to 
Is now overgrown 

'Cause nothing compares to you 
No matter where I look 
No matter what I do 
'Cause that garden of eden you took me to

Lucie Silvas,"Sliding Down - (L.Silvas/R.Lobb)

Why throw it all away
It wasn't easy to obtain
How do you keep your patience when I do it over and over again?
And God it seems so hard
Cause nothing in life makes sense when you tear it apart

When I try moving on
It doesn't mean my faith is gone
It's nothing more than distance
Maybe that will keep us strong
No I won't let you down
Cause nothing in life makes sense when you're not around

And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I loose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

And nothing comes for free
And now everything I see
Is how bad I try to take your place and all the love you give to me
Baby if I win I'll loose
Cause nothing I have even matters if I don't have you
If I don't have you

And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I loose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

And I know
I'm not giving you what you want
I'm not giving you what you need
With the faith of a little bird
Fly away to opportunity
And I roll the dice and I don't know which side up
Always gonna fall
And even though each day I get a little bit closer I might end up with nothing at all

And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I loose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

Oh if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I loose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

Why throw it all away
It wasn't easy to obtain
How do you keep your patience when I do it over and over again?



",Sliding Down
Lucie Silvas,"I got a wake up call, I got to make this work
Cause if we don't we're left with nothing and that's what hurts
We're so close to giving up but something keeps us here

I can't see what's yet to come
But I have imagined life without you and it feels wrong
I want to know where love begins, not where it ends

Cause we don't know what we're doing
We're just built this way
We're careless but we're trying
Cause we both make mistakes
And I don't want to keep on running
If we're only gonna fall behind
We've almost got it right
But almost wasn't what I had in mind

We want it all and deserve no less
But all we seem to give each other is second best
We're still reaching out for something that we can't touch

Cause we don't know what we're doing
We're just built this way
We're careless but we're trying
Cause we both make mistakes
And I don't want to keep on running
If we're only gonna fall behind
We've almost got it right
But almost wasn't what I had in mind

You know there's nothing like this love
So we don't want to let it go

Cause we don't know what we're doing
We're just built this way
We're careless but we're trying
Cause we both make mistakes
And I don't want to keep on running
If we're only gonna fall behind
We've almost it got right

I don't be ashamed

I won't get frustrated or turn back instead
I'll wait just a moment and take a deep breath
There's an easy thing to do

To bottle the raindrops and banish the clouds
Let the sun shine through, that is what I got to go

Counting 1,2,3 and 4
I won't let all these silly things bug me no more
Counting 5,6,7,8,9 and 10
I will count myself lucky and be happy again

A flash of anger with a single teardrop to explain
How your pain don't hide so easily

And it tells me I don't ever want nobody else

Acting like a fool

I'm starting to wise up

For more than a one way thing
But after all this time you're still not mine and it's finally sinking in

I got the wrong idea cause I'm not really part of your plan

Truly you're the sweetest thing
I have ever seen
You make me glean the crazy side of love
You're the one who can make me, shake me
Long before my time is due
Move it in the back and slide it from above
But I know a game or two you play
Baby, baby you're a liar and I fell for you
Baby
I couldn't get no higher
Without seeing through you
Baby now you've gone away from me
It's all over, bar the crying

Now I've had the time to think about
Where I went wrong
I know I'd run a mile to do it all once more
Spending lonely nights with someone
That I know I'll never love
Wishing things was like they were before
But I've gotten wiser to you babe
Baby I'm a liar and I fell I for you
Baby couldn't get no higher with you, no, no, no
Baby now you've gone away from me
It's all over, don't bother waiting",Baby You're a Liar
Lucifer's Friend,"I got to find a good time train
I know you say I'm looking pale as fever
All you want to do is groan
But now I say I'm glad you're on your own

The summer's been and gone again
I don't know where and I don't care where I'm going
You tried so hard to bring me down
But I'm not simply everybody's clown

Stop the world I need a little time right now
In my head I'm so confused
Busy little people in their big machine
Haven't got the time to feel abused

It's not that I'm the restless kind
But now I've go to satisfy my mind
I haven't got a thing to lose
And anyway I've got no time to choose

Summer's been and gone again
I don't know where
And I don't care where I'm going
When you see me at the break of dawn
Pull yourself together till I'm gone
Everybody's clown, everybody's clown",Everybody's Clown
Lucifer's Friend,"Hey baby would you stop those stupid games
That you are playing
Hey baby is it lies or is it true
What they are saying
When you're on your own you play around
Set me free

Hey baby is it mine or someone else's bed
You're sleep tonight
Tell me baby, if it's someone else, make sure
That he will treat you right
When you're on your own you play around
Set me free",Free Baby
Lucifer's Friend,"In the time of job when Joseph was a chippy
All the sons of pharaoh's were kings
The word was passed around
That mammon was a yippie
And papin had to learn a few things

First there was a light 
Copy right by Moses
And Abraham was playing the stooge
With pilot on the right and Mary and her roses
Had a reputation to lose

Oh yeah!
Oh behold the eye
Screw me I'm a tuba
Free as a beanstalk
Coogan flipped for, 
Get down on your knees and love
And love the man

Mary said to Joe there ain't no play
That's easy
You want to see them fall for the tricks
All we got to do is let them take it easy
And make like he's working for kicks

When they know job got up, the boss is in Judea
Knew they had a fish on the hook
Went calling all the boys
And sold them the idea
To write the story down in a book",In the Time of Job When Mammon Was a Yippie
Lucifer's Friend,"I saw the horses go by in the snow
I heard the hounds in full cry long ago
I saw my face in a dream down below
I heard the prisoners scream:room for more

Keep going they're hot on your heels
The longer you rest now the harder it feels
Nobody will open the door
Even your friends won't know you no more

Slowly I open my eyes no one there
Breakfast in bed would be nice no one here
I can't be laid there today - throw me out
What would I do without pain, go with out",Keep Goin'
Lucifer's Friend,"Lucifer's friend

Fear and fright since yesterday night
The little man knocked at my window
The hour he'd want but he had to run
But he'll be back again
Since yesterday night, I lived in fear of fright
I still hear his voice shouting
Through the night

I asked manny, I asked sue don't know
What to do
Every hour I cry I don't want to die
Fear is in my brain
Since yesterday night, I lived in fear of fright
I still hear his voice shouting
Through the night

Come take my hand I'm Lucifer's friend
Tonight is the end of your way

Lucifer's Friend,"Traveling this dark world, leaving light behind
Seeing things I shouldn't see
New eyes I got to find
Mars, Venus and stars shaking
Their heads at me
No more todays, tonight I'll be riding the sky

Hey world look out I'm coming
Friends pass me by and you saw me humming
Mars, Venus and stars shaking

Lucifer's Friend,"Blackness sliding everywhere
You took the train to come undaunted
'Cause it can't be late
Toxic shadows in the air
You find your own with a compulsion
Now it's too late

Tell me how'd you'd like to be
Then I'd listen and then I'd see
With nowhere left to go inside of you
Would you know what should be done lying, dying in the sun
Praying for the rising of the moon

I smell coal dust in your hair
You who bakes in a house of fire
With your feeling finger
Take my hard rock, put it there
Ooh babe just a little bit higher

Tell me you'd like to be
Then I'd listen and then I'd see
With no where left to go inside of you
Wouldn't you know what should be done
As you lay dying in the sun
The ragged crows close in the afternoon",Toxic Shadows
Lucifer's Friend,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

Lucilectric,"Do starrst ihn an, do gehst ihm nach
Und deinen Freunden auf den Geist.
Rennst vor ihm weg und schreibst ihm Briefe,
Die do sowieso zerreist.
Ein Blick, schon wirst do rot,
Dabei hat er nur durch dich durch geschaut.
Do wirst blaß, drehst dich weg
Und hast dich wieder nicht getraut.
Refrain:
Hey, hey, hey -
Zeig ihm was do willst!
Hey, hey, hey -
Laß ihn wissen, was do wirklich fühlst!
Hey, hey, hey -
Zeig ihm, wer do bist!
Hey, hey, hey -
Und dann küß ihn, daß er dich nie mehr vergißt!
Do träumst, ihr lacht, ihr küßt euch
Und dann sagt er dir, daß er dich liebt.
Do wirst wach, der nächste Tag,
An dem ihm gleich ist, ob's dich gibt.
Der nächste Tag, an dem do weißt,
Daß das mit euch ja doch nichts wird.
Noch 'n Tag, den ihr verliert,
Es wird Zeit das was passiert.

Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?

And will you sigh with me when I'm sad

Someone you love more than me.
And I hate to say it
But you have a right to be free
I know that's the way it should be.

But I'm too far gone
Too far gone.
I've loved you so much for so long
And I'm too far gone.

If ever your new love
Should hurt you or make you feel blue
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Just remember your old love
Will still be around loving you
I'll be around loving you.

Too far gone

And I'm too far gone.",Too Far Gone
