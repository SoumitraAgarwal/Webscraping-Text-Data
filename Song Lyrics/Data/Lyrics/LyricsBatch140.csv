George Strait,"Yeah every time my ship comes in
A hurricane blows it out again
Stormy weather seems to hang around my door
My sweet bird of pardise
Threw the poop on me last night
Whoa and every time it rain lord don't it pour

I got a letter from the IRS
They said son you're in a hell of a mess
Our computer shows you owe 10,000 more Well that machines made of bad mistakes
'Cause that's more than this poor boy makes
Whoa and every time it rain lord don't it pour

Every time it rains
I just wash my car
The whole neighborhood goes swimin' in my front yard
Well my mother-in-law
Says she's stayin' three weeks more
Whoa and every time in rain lord don't it pour

Just got my car right out the shop
Two blocks down the street it stops
I went through year On at the grocery store
I walked back to my chevrolet
But they towed that sucker away
Whoa and every time it rain lord don't it pour

Every time it rains
I just wash my car
The whole neighborhood goes swimin' in my front yard
Well my mother-in-law
Says she's stayin' three weeks more
Whoa and every time in rain lord don't it pour

Well and every time it rain lord don't it pour",Every Time It Rains (Lord Don't It Pour)
George Strait,"You don't dress up in satin,
You don't wear diamond rings,
But I'm satisfied with you.
You look just like an angel but you haven't got wings,
But I'm satisfied with you.

I'd rather have you just the way that you are
Than change you for somebody new.
Maybe I could do better if I reached for a star,
But I'm satisfied with you.

You're not made out of candy
But you're as sweet as you can be
So I'm satisfied with you.
I just can't see no reason why you bother with me,
But I'm satisfied with you.

I often wonder if it's all a mistake;
It's hard to believe that it's true.
But If I'm only dreaming, I sure don't want to wake,
'Cause I'm satisfied with you.

I'm satisfied with you.",I'm Satisfied with You
George Strait,"I used to like making love and then gettin' up and never havin' to explain
I've always been free I never could see me dragin' no ball and chain
I like running around and being tied down never was my cup of tea
But since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me
And I'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
Looking into her eyes I'm thinking bout future plans
And then I get the feelin' that the life that I'd been leadin'
Ain't all it's cracked up to be
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me

I used like to spend the night sittin' on an old barstool
Drinking wine and killing time with all over those other fools
But since you took my hand I think I understand it ain't the way it out to be
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me
And I'm beginning to like
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me",A Little Heaven's Rubbing Off on Me
George Strait,"Lady I know your out there somewhere
Like me your feeling lost
Maybe right now we both need each other
But our paths may never cross

People like us never find each other
Love is our greatest loss
Baby I know you are out there some where
But our paths may never cross

We're to people that should be together
'Cause we're lonely at the very same time
But there's a million to many good reasons
Why your love can never be mine

Maybe this song was written for you
Listen, don't turn it off
I wish you could learn it
And come sing it with me
But our paths may never cross

I wish you could learn it
And come sing it with me
But our paths may never cross",Our Paths May Never Cross
George Strait,"Well lately you've been showin' all the signs
Of a woman with someone else on her mind
It's not your fault
Some nights I've left you alone
And if you're thinkin', you want a stranger
There's one comin' home

[Chorus]
If you're thinkin' you want a stranger
I'll soon be there
You're gonna see a change in me
This time I swear
No more late nights
Comin' in at daylight
And no more doin' you wrong
And if you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one comin' home

Bought you a silk gown and perfume today
Picked up some roses 
And champagne on the way
Oh I called to ask you
To put some soft music on
'Cause if you're thinkin', you want a stranger
There's one comin' home

[Chorus]

And if you're thinking you want a stranger
There's one comin' home",If You're Thinking You Want aStranger (There's One Coming Home)
George Strait,"Any old time you get lonely,
Nights get cold or love is blue,
Just snuggle up honey; you're my one and only,
Any old time, I'm here for you.

Pay no mind to the hour
Or how far away you may be.
Any old time you can find me, drop in a dime
and there I'll be.

Any old time you start missin'
Somebody to hold, to keep you company,
I'll be willin' when you want my kissin',
Any old time, just call on me.

Pay no mind to the hour
Or how far away you may be.
Any old time you can find me, drop in a dime
and there I'll be.",Any Old Time
George Strait,"I knew the stakes were high right from the start
When she dealt the cards I dealt my heart
Now I just found a game that I can't play
And this is where the cowboy rides away

And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
It's time to say goodbye to yesterday
This is where the cowboy rides away

We've been in and out of love and in between
And now we play the final showdown scene
And as the credits roll a sad song starts to play
This is where the cowboy rides away

And my heart is sinking like a setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
Oh the last goodbye is the hardest one to say
This is where the cowboy rides away

Oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say
This is where the cowboy rides away",The Cowboy Rides Away
George Strait,"Well,

They call me the fireman, that's my name.
Making my rounds all over town, putting out old flames.
Well everybody'd like to have a what I got.
I can cool 'em down when they're smoldering hot.
I'm the fireman, that's my name.

Last night they had a bad one a mile or two down the road.

George Strait,"Angels and devils share the same tables
And that's not so wrong if you get it done right.
Halos and horns lock up on the dance floor
On a honkytonk Saturday night.

It's a honkytonk Saturday night,
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might.
With luck she'll turn on 'fore they turn out the lights
On a honkytonk Saturday night.

I played the jukebox, I played some merle haggard,
Me and the waitress think he's outta' sight.
Then some folks got thirsty while we were dancin'

And I love you though we've never met
Wait there for me, I'll recognize you
Someone lonesome, someone hurtin', someone blue
That'll be you

George Strait,"I once had a love, a true and lasting love
But the fool in me came out one night
And with her loving eyes she saw right through my eyes
And she changed the night I stepped across the line

I should have watched that first step
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be
That first step did something to her mind

I watched her slip away a little more every day
And my conscience couldn't live with all that pain
She's growing colder since the day I told her
And the love we had will never be the same

I should have watched that first step
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be
That first step did something to her mind
That first step did something to her mind",I Should Have Watched That First Step
George Strait,"When things get bad at home, you don't feel like being alone,
And you find yourself inclined to look around.
For the feelings we once shared are just no longer there,
And love comes from the other side of town.

Where love means just an hour with your stand in,
And not an empty house where love just has been.
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,
Now love comes from the other side of town.

The life I'm livin' now just don't seem right somehow,
But it's the best way to get by that I've found.
There's no love left at home, we're both just hangin' on,
And love comes from the other side of town.

Where love means just an hour with your stand in,
And not an empty house where love just has been.
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,
Now love comes from the other side of town.

Love comes from the other side of town",Love Comes from the Other Side of Town
George Strait,"Sometimes I smile
When you stayed home for a while
What did you expect me to do

I always cried
Each time you tolled a lie
What did you expect me to do

Each time I forgave you
You grew bolder
And each time you hurt me
My heart grew colder
Sure I loved
But I found someone new
What did you expect me to do

Each time I forgave you
You grew bolder
And each time you hurt me
My heart grew colder
Sure I loved
But I found someone new
What did you expect me to do",What Did You Expect Me to Do
George Strait,"As I waltz in the arms of somebody new
Could it be what I feel may be too much too soon
But the way that you touch me, I want to give in
It's not so easy holding you when

You're dancing this dance all wrong
New steps don't come easy when old memories hang on
I'm finding I'm falling as the music plays on
Keep dancing this dance all wrong

A new partner's touch to an old partner's song
I'm getting the feeling as we dance along 
Two strangers tonight won't be strangers for long

I'm finding I'm falling as the music plays on

Let's go honky tonkin' honey take my hand

George Strait,"Haven't you heard, Daddy's gone crazy
Haven't you heard, Mama is gone

Here I stand with my finger on his doorbell
My mind goes back to what I did last night
You see I finally talked his wife into leaving him
And I'm just trying to convince my conscience that it's alright

Well I can see my old friend sittin there just starin
And his little boy is cryin words that are welded in my mind

You're first night out
I won't ask you where you've been
You're so ashamed in you're eyes
Can't beat mine
I've seen that look on me a thousand times

What makes us do the things we do
Heaven only knows
We think we've got a secret
But it always shows
I've taught you how to cheat
You're doin' fine
I've seen that look on me a thousand times

But I still love you
And so I pretend and hope I never see that look again
But if I do I know the fault is mine

Ain't it a pain in your heart
Ain't worth the trouble anyhow
I'd like to give it up
I've had enough and I've done my part
But I'm in too deep to pull out now

Good things we've had are going bad
And I don't know why
I'd turn it around if I knew how

We need to get our love back on its feet again
We've come to far to let it come to an end

Doing all I can
I can't stand to see us fall apart

You've been untrue for the last time.

When I caught you cheatin' me it was my worst time.

""If You've Got the Money, Honey"" got my nickels one by one.
I tried to imitate that song.

""Always Late"" breaks my heart.
In every song he sang, I played the part.
I heard he was sad, and lived alone.
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.

In the cold October rain.
Most folks stayed home and warm,

Woman you sure got this old redneck feeling blue
Whats going on inside me I ain't used to going through
This ol country boys hillbilly heart is breaking in two
Yea, you sure got this old redneck feeling blue

I've never seen anything,hit me quite like this
You know the pain and loneliness it keeps hanging with me
Oh, this good time Joe, he took quite a blow

To mend my mind,and put me out of my misery

And watch the fire embers glow

Taking someone's lover far away

Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl
And now that I've found you

But I make my livin' on the go
Big silver eagle spreads her wings
And drops us at another show
I think about holdin' my baby tonight
As I listen to the big wheels roll
Three days into a six week tour,
Gettin' in the rhythm of the road

We pick and sing,
Say ""goodnight"" then we'll be flyin'
My world's a chain of one-night-stands
Strung together by the center line
I don't know where I'll wake up tomorrow,
But I can't let the tempo slow
Every town is just another beat,
Livin' in the rhythm of the road

The rhythm of the road's got a mind of its own
If you find it it'll drive you insane
Like the clackity-clack of a railroad track
I'm rattlin' like an old freight train
Towns are flashin' by, the folks are wavin' ""hi""
They all start to look the same
Gotta stop for a minute, be glad I'm in it
Remember just why I came

Those highway signs, Lord, they keep me on the move
I think about givin' it up sometimes,
And gettin' in a diff'ren groove
But I just let the days slide by,

George Strait,"Well I'm out on a tear 'cause she's tearing me apart
If I look rough on the outside, you ought to see my heart.
And this look in my eyes shows beyond a doubt,
Since my woman left, I'm down and out.

Well, I'm down at the bar, out of my mind,
Tighter than an eight-day clock with no way to unwind,
That jukebox cries the blues like it knows what I'm about.
Since my woman left, I'm down and out.

Well I'm down to my last dollar, but I don't really care.
My friends have all got whiskey, and they don't mind if I share.

Picked up some roses 
And champagne on the way
Oh I called to ask you
To put some soft music on
Cause if you're thinking, you want a stranger
There's one coming home

George Strait,"Pardon me, you left your tears on the jukebox
And I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry, it's just that I
Noticed you goin' out of your mind
It looks like were two of a kind

[Chorus]
Let's fall to pieces together
Why should we both fall apart
Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms

Alone is much better together
When the worst is still yet to come
So let's share the rest, of the tears that are left
From two hearts that just came undone
Why should we go crazy alone",Let's Fall to Pieces Together
George Strait,"We said goodbye in Marina del Rey
""I had a good time""
Was the last thing I heard her say
As I walked away

And on the plane back to Tennessee
My mind comes across her memory
And yesterday
In Marina del Rey

[Chorus]
On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we laid down on
And loved the world away
In Marina del Rey
And as we looked into each others' eyes
We were lost in paradise
Like two castaways
In Marina del Rey

Like the ocean tide's highs and lows
Love sometimes comes and goes away
In Marina del Rey
And as this plane is touchin' down
Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed
In Marina del Rey

[Chorus]

We said goodbye
In Marina del Ray",Marina del Rey

Though you're gone, I can't forget

That flush on your cheeks

it looks good on you.

[Chorus]
You look so good in love
You want him that's easy to see.
You look so good in love 
I wish, you still wanted me.

He must have stolen 
some stars from the sky.
And gave them to you
to wear in your eyes.
I had my chances
but I set you free.
And now I wonder
why I couldn't see.

[Chorus]

Darlin I've wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you 
but tonight your beauty is shining through.
And I never took the time to let you know
so before he takes you away,
please let me say

George Strait,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cop pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made out of snow, but the children know 
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in that old silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and have some fun now, before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic car
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, ""Stop""

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', ""Please don't cry, I'll be back again some day""",Frosty the Snowman

Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation

But I always come back to myself

That won't let go of me
They pull me in and out of touch

But that's what I get
I've come to expect it from you

A million times
A million lines
And I've bought 'em, every one

You rip and tear

I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars
That I'm alive and you're the way you are

How could you do what you've gone and done to me

But what the hell
It wouldn't do a bit a good

I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's

Please drive her on home

Get down upon your knees and pray
Cause you're gonna need me
You're gonna need my help someday

And that I love her cat

And baby blue was the color of her eyes.
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,
And I still don't know why,
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.

She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched.
And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much.
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do,
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue.

Don't always wear the white hat, won't always know the way
I may not even be the dream, you wanted to come true
But, I'll always be the man in love with you

I'm not the key, that opens every door
Don't have the power, to give you all you want and more
But when you're needing something special, you can hold on to
I'll always be the man in love with you

I never could work miracles
There may be others, who can do what I can't do
But no one else could be, as good as me at loving you

When the world won't turn, the way you wish it would
And the dreams you have don't come alive, as often as they should
Remember that there's some one there, whose heart is always true
I'll always be the man in love with you

Some one there, to help you make it through

A pink dress, a matching bow, and her ponytail

Next day I chased her around the playground
Cross the monkey bars to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote

Do you love me do you want to be my friend
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes

Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Not much has changed I still chase Emmylou

And like a child you lead me through
A wonderland of love

Life I can't visualize
Without you by my side
Life would be meaningless
Like some of those sky's
Though you show me everyday
Your love in every way
I'm afraid it's all a dream
That'll favor your way

Sometimes I need insurance of your love
For you soft and gentle touch
All the kings are worthy none
And at these times you take me by the hand
And like a child you lead me through
A wonderland of love

Wonderland of love",Wonderland Of Love [Album Version]
George Strait,"You swear you've had enough, you're ready to give up
On that little lie they call love, then out of the blue clear sky
Fallin' right into your hands, like rain on the desert sand
It's the last thing you had planned out of the blue clear sky.

Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky.

Ain't love a funny thing, one day you're givin' up the dream
And the next you're pickin' out a ring out of the blue clear sky.

Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky.",Blue Clear Sky
George Strait,"I don't take my whiskey to extremes
Don't believe in chasin' crazy dreams
My feet are planted firmly on the ground
But darlin' when you come around

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on
Baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day
I get carried away

It might seem like an ordinary night
Same ol' stars same ol' moon up high
But when I see you standin' at your door
Nothin's ordinary anymore

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on
Baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day
I get carried away

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on
Baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day

Carried away",Carried Away
George Strait,"Once you told me you were gonna love me
That it was meant to be and there's no other way
Then came someone showed you more fun
We've had a good run better think it over

Do the right thing baby do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing

He's got a good line, shows you a good time
Did he change your mind guess it's your move
I'll lose my pride I'd even step aside
Honey you really must decide who's best for you

Do the right thing baby do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing
Do the right thing baby do the right thing
Go with your heart and do the right thing

Seen lots of folks and lots of faces
Even settled down a time or two
I've worked the farms, I've been to town
Guess you could say I've been around
But I ain't never seen no one like you

I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way
But girl I think it's far to warn ya
I've done been to California
I ain't never seen no one like you

I knew a girl in Mississippi
Had twenty different ways to kiss me
Never found a thing she couldn't do
Hey I even knew some twins in Denver
Stayed with them one cold December

George Strait,"Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him, it could be anything
And she always expected the worst
In the back of her mind

He said, it's cold out here and I'm all alone
Didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon
And honey is there somethin' wrong

She said, don't bother comin' home
By time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

He left that phone danglin' off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

She said, don't bother comin' home
By time you get here I'll be long gone

Want to try again
But there's no way of workin' out
This love that we're not in

We could talk and talk and accomplish nothin'
We've tried it all before
It's time somebody did some walkin'
And I can see the door

So I'd just as soon go
I'd just as soon say goodbye
There's no reason to prolong
What we should just let die

And I'd just as soon stop
I'd just as soon end the madness
Knowin' what I know
I'd just as soon go

It's not an easy thing to do
Leavin' seldom ever is
But stayin' just to see us through
Just ain't no way to live

It's hard for you to understand
But we're better off this way
I can't fake it one more night

George Strait,"I gave her that diamond she dreamed of,
And I bought her a home with a view.
I took her to the end of the rainbow,
But all I left her was blue.
Seems I never had time to love her,
And now it seems time just stands still.

I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.

Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.

You were waitin' tables at the corner diner

Never seen a woman look any finer

From that moment on
I was stone cold gone
You would be forever in my mind

Now somewhere in the neon lights
I'm holdin' on for dear life
Rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight

It was San Francisco
Silly suits and white ties by the bay
You appeared with your papa
Tears were rollin' down your mama's face

Everyone was happy
Showered by well wishers as we drove away

I'm laughing but crying

'Cause I'm carrying your love with me

I could just have easily have let you get away
In that crowded airport far from my hometown
If I had lost my courage then you wouldn't be around
I'm glad I had the nerve

And I'm glad he had the nerve to get down on his knees
And say ""I bought this ring for you, won't you wear it please?""
My daddy sure touched somethin' in my momma's heart somehow
If he hadn't, I sure wouldn't be here with you now
I'm glad he had the nerve

Or learned like this
Or laughed like this
Or loved like this

I'm glad he had the nerve to sail across the sea

He met an indian maiden, in the Smoky Mountain mist
If they hadn't crossed that line, I would not exist
I'm glad they had the nerve

And I'm glad He had the nerve, while staring into space
To give this universe a time and a place
With one tiny atom, or an Adam and an Eve
However you look at it, whatever you believe
I'm glad He had the nerve

Or we never would've live like this

This feelin' just keeps gettin' stronger as the time goes by.
It's written on my face, you can see it in my eye.
My love for you is true.

True, like the sun comin' up each mornin'.
Bright as the light in a baby's smile.
Sure as the mountain river windin'.
Right as the rain fallin' from the sky.
Girl, my love for you
Is true.",True
George Strait,"You take it nice and easy
You play it safe 'cause that's what people do today

Girl somewhere in your mind
There must be a perfect time to fall in love
But baby I'm burning up

[Chorus]
So why not now, why not here? 
Darlin' my heart just ain't too clear
Oh what are we waiting for
Cause I've never been so sure
Why not you, why not me
Livin' like we were meant to be
Together, forever
Why not now

Right here in this moment
We could start a love to stand the test of time
Baby you know that's right
No one knows tomorrow
The mornin' sun could rise and take our chance away
Long gone with yesterday, so

George Strait,"The laughter is gone 
The cryin' is over
And I'm not losin' sleep anymore

I'm waitin' for my change of heart

I wake up alone
Knowin' I'm on my own again
Got it all straight in my head
Must be somethin' I missed
As I went down the list
Of the things I need to forget
Everything's gone
But you haven't left me yet

I painted our room 
Replaced all the curtains
And there's a new rug on the floor
Called up the Good Will
Said come and get it
Everything she left behind is yours
I can still see you drivin' away
So why do I still see your face
When

I wake up alone
Knowin' I'm on my own again
Got it all straight in my head
Must be somethin' I missed
As I went down the list
Of the things I need to forget

It's all over for me if you go

They don't know you're packing their clothes
At least they didn't see me crying
When you said that's the way love goes

Somehow in conversation
I'm lost in sweet temptation

I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes
I look at you, when I lay me down at night

I look at you, and I know I've got it all
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you

'Cause I can't miss the bad luck that's fallen from the sky
I'm under some dark cloud, and there's only one way out

George Strait,"She sparkles, she dazzles, she lights up the room

You're still dancing with me 
And I'm holding you once again

She draws the curtains, and slowly we climb up the stairs 
And reach for each other the passion begins 
We fall together as lovers and then,

Meanwhile back in the back of my memory 
You're still lying with me
And I'm holding you once again 

I try and I try, the Lord knows I do 
But each time my heart beats back to you

I'll find a way somehow

You'll always be with me
But I'll never hold you again

George Strait,"Last night I had a dream, dreamt I had it all I had it all
I had one truck, one car
One boat, one guitar
But all these things wouldn't get me too far
If I didn't have one of you

I work hard every day to bring home all my pay
I got one house, one yard
One dog who likes to bark
We'd be cold, living the dark if I didn't have one of you

One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete

Where a crystal clear lake makes it crystal clear

There's a giant old oak tree that knows just how to shade
That midday summer sun when it's showin' off it's rays
While I'm making you a momma to mother natures's sound

That's where I wanna take our love and settle down

That's where I wanna raise the babies that we make

Thought everything was going alright, but I was running out of time.
'Cause you had one foot out the door, I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away, here's some final words from me.

Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know,
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down.
Take my words, read 'em every day, keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away,
So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down.

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
'Cause every single word is true, and I think you need to know,
So use it as a bookmark, stick it on your 'frigerator door,
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel where you'll see it for sure.

Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know,
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down.
Take my words, read 'em every day, keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away,
So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down.

You can find a chisel, I can find a stone.
Folks will be reading these words, long after we're gone.

Jack Front nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows some turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you",The Christmas Song

A time to give and to receive
My Christmas list consists of just one sweet dream

I know what I want for Christmas this year
I hope my note got to Santa on time
I'm a little bit nervous
It's kind of a big thing I'm asking for
I don't know if I deserve it but boy if I get it
I'll never ask for anything more
It shines, it's new
And it's the one wish that I wish would come true
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you

We can build a little fire
We can sit and talk for hours
We'll just have fun
You can tell me what you did
Christmas morning as a kid
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come

And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway
I'm sure to get a kiss
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow
To complete this singular wish
It shines, it's new
I know what I want and nothin' else will do
This year for Christmas, I just want to be with you

And nobody could stand to see him do without

But Catherine needs your prayers tonight
Morning light brought Sam a daughter
Fever took his better half
Sam gave Catherine to the water
As he held their baby to his chest

Calm waters
Wished him well

But she took the wind from his sails

I think it's rain

And there it is the cold hard truth
So plain to see

Where do you stand?
What's your point of view?
I guess it all depends on
Which side of the glass

And orders one more whiskey
Lights another smoke
He shivers at the memory 
And trembles as he stirs

George Strait,"If you are sincere when you say you don't care
That we should just let the past be
If the love that we knew don't bother you

And if still loving you means I'm weak, then I'm weak
And I still fall apart when you speak or we meet
If the love that we knew don't bother you
Darlin' you're stronger than me

If you can have fun with some other one

If it's easy to say that it's better this way

With a tent, Coleman, sleeping bags
Some fishin' poles, a cooler of cokes,
Three days before we had to back
When your seven and your in your seventh heaven
Going campin' in the wild outdoors
As we turned off on that old dirt road he look at me and swore
Dad, this could be the best day of my life
Been dreamin' day and night about the fun we'll have
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go insane
When you're in your teens your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
We're not zoned in till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel
He said Dad this could be the best day of my life
Been dreamin' day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doin' what I've always wanted too
I'm the luckiest boy around
This is the best day of my life

Standin' in the middle of the room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Lookin' at him I said

About being like you

George Strait,"Nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue.
They never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used.
But someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul.
They got away with murder down on music row.

The almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame
Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang 
(oh, you tell them Alan).
They all say not guilty, but the evidence will show
That murder was committed down on music row.

For the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play,
But drums and rock 'n roll guitars are mixed up in your face.
Old Hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio
Since they committed murder down on music row.

They thought no one would miss it, once it was dead and gone
They said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating songs (I'll still buy'em)
Well there ain't no justice in it and the hard facts are cold
Murder's been committed down on music row.

Oh, the steel guitars no longer cry and you can't hear fiddles play

Don't tell me you're not in love
When your heart beats like it does
Your trembling body tells on you
Each time we touch

You can tell me you're afraid
I am too and that's okay

Dropped in one night and never came again

And the sound of laughter runnin' out the door

If there was anything to be seen
Maybe I could tell the difference between
Where I am and where I've been

So if I stare off in the distance sometimes
And get that far away look in my eye
It's that my baby went and left me out there
All alone in the middle of nowhere

Way out in the middle of nowhere
Oh nobody wants to go there
My baby's gone and she don't care
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere

Standin' at the edge of the sky
On top of a mountain so tall
Wishin' to God I could fly, fly, fly
When I ain't even done climbin' the wall

Could you help me let the teardrops roll
Awe anything to cleanse my soul
Or if you've got a single raindrop to spare

From Atlanta in '53
And I picked up a Rhythm & Blues magazine

And it would take more than the Crew Cuts
And Pat Boone to take me home

Give me the real thing
Make it loud I'll make you proud

You're gonna pull my string

Full of curves, lessons learned at every bend
Goin's rough unlike the straight and narrow

It's for those who go against the grain
Have no fear, dare to dream of a change
Live to march to the beat of a different drummer
And it all might come together
And it all might come unraveled
On the road less traveled

For the road less traveled ain't for the faint of heart
For those who choose to play it safe and never stray too far
Me I wanna live my life and one day leave my mark
And it all might come together
And it all might come unraveled
On the road less traveled

I've chosen a pathway I may not endure
One thing's for certain nothin's for sure
And it all might come together
Or it all might come unraveled
On the road less traveled

For the road less traveled ain't for the faint of heart
For those who choose to play it safe and never stray too far

So catch a ride, catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough

Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

If you ain't got a suit case
Get a box or an old brown paper sack
And pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back

There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it

Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough

He said, ""I hate this bar and I hate to drink,
But on second thought, tonight I think, I hate everything.""

Then he opened up his billfold and threw a twenty down,
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground.

I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight.

Who offered a broken hello,
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico.

She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return,
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern.
Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo:

Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me
She can do just fine on her own two feet
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide
Her stubborn will or her fighting side
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else

Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls
Boys ain't they something
Sure are some proud girls
But you can't beat their loving

And I'll tell you right now girls
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls
How 'bout 'em boys",How 'Bout Them Cowgirls
George Strait,"I pack up my saddle
Throw it in that two-horse trailer
Back up my truck, hook 'em up
And drive away
Won't be the first time
But this time's the last time
She meant it when she said
That's all I've got to say
Never had been thrown like this before
I ain't her cowboy anymore

Never saw it comin'
But I knew where it was goin'
When she asked how long this time
Before I hit the road
She didn't come right out and say it
But I sure got the message
When I reached out to hold her
That shoulder sure was cold
Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course
I ain't her cowboy anymore

[Chorus]
These white lines are a blur
Like the last few nights I spent with her
I don't know where I went wrong
Or if I did
Like the good ol' boy I am
I told her that I understand
But Lord knows that I won't long as I live
Seems lately every time it rains it pours
I ain't her cowboy anymore

We met in Denver
Settled down in Dallas
The best days of my life
Were the ones I spent with her
You'd think that all that lovin' ought to count for something
Guess I wore out my welcome
Like the rowels of these old spurs
That Casper sunset's what I'm shootin' for
'Cause I ain't her cowboy anymore

I ain't her cowboy anymore",I Ain't Her Cowboy Anymore

Tumble weeds roll, and the stars shine
Wind howls, dawn breaks

Don't have to think it through

I'm gonna meet a lot of resistance
It takes every ounce of strength we've got

But life's a journey, no need to hurry
It's one day at a time

Take one step then take another
Keep on walkin', we're headed in the right direction

Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other

What's down the road we can't say
And the road behind don't matter
But every mile along the way
Is just another mile together
Unconcerned about the twists and turns
We're takin' it nice and slow
Safe and sound, covering ground
Steady as she goes

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow takes care of itself
We'll just keep on keepin' on
'Cause we ain't stumbled yet

Just a-walkin' and a-talkin' and a-movin' in the same direction

Icebergs in the Gulf of Mexico
And there's not one star in Heaven
Or a sunrise every morning
I'd believe it if she told me so

I know people say she has a lover
Referring to this guy she's come to know
Well, they're just friends, she loves him like a brother
And she's never even kissed him, she told me so

George Strait,"Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Nor thorns infest the ground

Down at the job site
The day that this stranger walked in

Was there were no doors in the plans
He said if you build this for me

She'll never be able to leave me again

It's that you can't make a women feel something she don't

I thought I just ruined his day
I just couldn't bear to see this man's last hope slip away

And if there ain't one, she'll make one

George Strait,"I'm on my way to Amarillo
I can't seem to get my fill of that
Little west Texas Town
I've got a sweet thing built, right Betty
Head to toe, shes mighty pretty
Living in that west Texas town

Friday comes, it's time to roll
Time for me to hit the road
I've got my eyes on the horizon
My little dish in that panhandle
Lights up like a Roman Candle
When I reach that west Texas town
Ah, sing it Dean

From Big Spring all the way to Plainview
I can't wait to get to you know who
In that west Texas town
I drive through hell and half of Texas
Just to get to her by breakfast
Waiting in the west Texas town

Your big Poppa's coming home
To that west Texas town

Don't go in the summertime
It's too hot and the rooms are high
But if you go in the fall, you'll have a ball
There's so much to see and do
When you're in love

There's an old hotel right on the beach
Romantic rooms you won't want to leave
But take my word take a stroll into town
There's so much to see and do
When you're in love

Don't miss Jamaica Joe's
You can dine out fresco
Then dance in the street till the sun comes up
You can take a barefoot cruise
Share a moonlight made for two
There's so little time and so much to see and do
When you're in love

Be sure and take, lots of pictures when you're there
Be sure and make, lots of memories trust me

George Strait,"Everyday is a lifetime without you
Hard to get through, since you've been gone
So I do the only thing I know how to, to get by
I'm living for the night

I've drawn all the curtains in this old house
To keep the sun out and off my face
Friends stop by to check-in 'cause I've checked out
I tell them I'm fine, I'm living for the night

I can't hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbyes
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I'm living for the night

I'm a whole lot easier to talk to,
When I've had a few, I settle down
Whiskey kills the man you've turned me into
And I come alive
I'm living for the night

Daylight can't hide the tears I cried, the pain that came with your goodbyes
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I'm living for the night
I'm living for the night

Everyday is a lifetime without you",Living for the Night
George Strait,"He rode up on a winter day
Steam risin' off a streak face bay
Said you probably know my name
If you don't it's Arkansas Dave

He talked of fifteen years ago
And how he got the bay he rode
He said he killed a man in Ohio
First man he killed, first horse he stole

It was a long road for Arkansas Dave
He shot and left him where he laid
He said he'd never forget that winter day
He rode off on a streak faced bay

I stood up and I shook his hand
Told no one that I knew this man
Started thinkin' of a plan
Bout how I'd deal him his last hand
Didn't take him long to come unwound
He jumped up and gunned two men down
Ran outside to leave the town
But ole bay was nowhere to be found

I head out with my forty-four
And when he walked back through the door
I shot till I could shoot no more
And Dave Rudabough fell to the floor

It was the end of the road for Arkansas Dave
I shot and left him where he laid

George Strait,"He looks up from second base
Dad's up in the stands
He saw the hit, the run, the slide
There ain't no bigger fan

In the parking lot after the game
He said ""Dad I thought you had a plane to catch?""
He smiled and said ""Yeah son I did""

But life's not the breath you take
The breathing in and out
That gets you through the day
Ain't what its all about
You just might miss the point
Trying to win the race
Life's not the breaths you take
But the moments that take your breath away

Fast forward fifteen years
And a thousand miles away
Boys built a life, he's got a wife
And a baby due today
He hears a voice saying ""I made it son""
Says ""I told you Dad, you didn't have to come""
He smiles and says ""Yeah I know you did""

But life's not the breath you take
The breathing in and out
That gets you through the day
Ain't what its all about
You just might miss the point
Trying to win the race
Life's not the breathes you take

Just like it took my breath away when she was born
Just like it took my breath away when Dad took his last that morn

Life's not the breathes you take

Acted like a fool, crackin' crazy jokes
She turned his motor on, man his heart was gone

Easy as you go, steady as you fly
Keep it in the road, keep an eagle eye
Turn it on a dime, man you never know
Take a little time, whoa, easy as you go

In the fading light he became a man
She discovered love better be enough

I go to meet the boys for a cold one, at a little joint up the street
They got a jukebox in the corner, full of old country tunes
Feed it five dollars worth of quarters, is the first thing I always do

'Cause I need a little twang
A little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
Some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
To get that foot stompin' honkey tonkin' feeling going through my veins
I need a little twang, twang, twang

Well, I like a lot of kinds of music
I try to keep an open mind
Depending on the mood to strike me
If I'm gonna stay 'till closing time
So when I wanna lift my spirits to get me feeling worth a dang
I know I'm gonna have to hear it
'Cause I gotta have some Hank to hang

And I'm agreeing more and more with my old man

Man how they fly by

And I read the good book these days and believe it

Scramble' round the cockpit thinkin' we're gonna win
Seven hours later, we still ain't caught a thing

I put it in free spool

I'd never, ever take another drink again
I fought it like the devil, but you know that you're in trouble

When you're fourteen and drunk by ten a.m.
Tried to hide it from my mom and dad, all my friends said, straighten up
I just laughed, said, you don't understand
That's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinkin' man

At sixteen I was on my own and flyin' high
And stayin' stoned
I knew everything there was to know
I did things that I can't talk about
I wore my mom and daddy out
Late nights they spent prayin' for my soul
Stayed sober once for nine days in a row
I quit cold turkey and damn near almost
Made it to ten

I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can

I don't know when or where it was or how we met
And fell in love
Or why she'd even fall for a guy like me
I tried to pull myself together, hopin' we could last forever

Son, don't ever break her heart
Promise me before you take her hand

But I can't find one good reason
Why she's gone so soon.

Our life together had just begun.
I didn't know what my future would hold,
But you gave me a chance,
So I set out on the road.

There were times I almost threw that old towel in,
But you kept callin' me back to the stage,
And I finally found my place in each and every face.

There's still things that I want to say and do.
I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.
And just know that I'll always remember you.

When I first set out on the road, I figured
I had maybe five good years to sing my songs for you folks.
Well, it's goin' on thirty now
And I still love it just as much as I ever did.
When I hear that announcer say my name,
And I walk through those curtains
And see your smilin' faces,
My feet don't touch the ground again
Til I walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.
I don't know how many more years I've got left to do this,
But I figure a few.
I do want you to know, though,
That when I do walk off this stage for the last time,
And I'm all settled in, away from all this,
You won't be far away.
I'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind.

George Strait,"At a truck stop in St Angelo
Saw a bill board about this rodeo
This weekend out in El Paso
So I signed up to ride

I drew a bull called ""original sin""
Heard he'd killed a couple of men
Figured this was something I could win
'Cause the devil was on my side
I was havin' myself one hell of a ride
But I ended up disqualified
That bull just up and died

Thought I'd paid all my dues
Then those south Texas blues,

Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose,

Well I got laid off at Brown and Rue
Then on my way back to cuttin' chute
I lost my wrist watch and my boots
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston
Well there ain't no jobs here workin' cattle
So I got on the part time haulin' gravel
With some outfit from Seattle out here building custom homes

Well I gassed my truck and I packed my clothes
Turned in my key and I hit the road
I said ""cow town's where I'll go,
You never know, I might get lucky!""

Well I got a friend there turning knobs
At a place called Billy Bobs
Said thought he could get me a job there
Workin' as a bouncer
First night on the job was just insane
Some ol' boy got all deranged
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain

George Strait,"You played me for a fool
And I played the part so well
You played it smart, you played it cool
Broke every promise, every rule
And I couldn't even tell

You looked me in the eyes
And said, I was the only one
It was no surprise
That I kept falling for your lies
And they had only just begun

Fool me once, shame on you
You told me that you would be true
You were so easy to believe
Fool me twice, shame on me

I thought I'd won your heart
But you were still in love with him
You said we'd never be apart
It was a lie right from the start
You left me hanging on this limb

I never thought that you could be
The kind to hurt me just for fun
But it's sure no fun for me
I think it's time to set you free
Pick myself up and say we're done

George Strait,"A showman's life is a smokey bar
And the fevered chase of a tiny star

They told me all about the pretty girls
And the wine and the money and the good times
There's no mention of all the wear and tear
On an old honky tonker's heart
Well I might have known it
But nobody told me about this part

Of a Great White Way, until the dream comes true

Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road

Like nothing I've ever seen
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream

Baby fall into my kiss

Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
'Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight

Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back

That says, I'm sorry, I know I was wrong
I can't find the words that don't make it cheap
It's right on the verge and just out of reach
It must be a sad song with a blue melody
And I'll bet you it's lonesome, as lonesome as can be
But I'm starting to wonder if there's such a thing
As a sad song that's too sad to sing

Maybe tonight, maybe this time tomorrow
Me and this guitar will get right with this sorrow
And I'll play it for you, and you'll come back to me
'Cause you were always a fool for the blue melodies

So it must be a sad song in three quarter time
That chills down to the bone when the steel guitars cry
But if it's not the one that brings you home to me
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing

Awe but if it's not the one that brings you back to me
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing

But it's hard to see the stars with these tears in my eyes
Yeah, it's hard not to cry

There's broken hearts that'll never be the same
Shattered lives still reeling from the pain
Of plans and dreams now gone
Oh, how do you move on?

But I believe
There's someone who's looking after me
Someone beside me night and day
To light the way
It's hard to conceive
Something you can't see
But I believe

There's twenty-six angels looking down from above
Resting in his mercy, grace and love
Time may never heel

Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you comin' over, I already thought it over
And OK, so now what

And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where

We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor's said, you know what's on the way?
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out

And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now?
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are

But I just can't go on dying like this

Can I see you tonight?
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?

I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess

It's a whole lot more than going to the store for a wedding ring
It's kissin' and a huggin' but it's also the kicking and the cussing thing
I've been told

Love is everything
It's a smile on your face on a cold winter day at the thought of spring
It's getting up at night for the cry of a little bitty baby thing
And it's growing old

Love is everything
It's those fires that daddy stoked those nights to keep you warm
It's the hell your mama went through the day you were born
And it's a thunderstorm

Love is everything
Oh, it's going off to war, it's the back and forth on a front porch swing
It's the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen
And it's you and me

Love is everything
It's looking out for everybody else but number one
And it's all that really matters when all's said and done
And the race is run

Love is everything

The night is young and the sun's been down a long time

It's half-past a half-full glass
And since you asked
We're gonna dance the night
Right into broad daylight
You know it'd be worth our while
So, give me that come get me smile
You know the one, mmm
And I'll come undone

Throw your arms 'round

Like when somebody's gone before they go
When it comes to love, you never really learn

Oh, you tell yourself you've had enough

When the good Lord called you home on that sunny day in June

Everywhere I look there's one more memory
There's a little bit of you in everything I see

Seems to rain now all the time, hadn't seen this much in years

George Strait,"Full moon Friday night after the game
Stars must have all lined up early that day
I just turned seventeen, she had me by a month
We were young, we were green, to the taste, to the touch
From that very first kiss, it was like we were born for that moment
Caught up in the perfect storm

It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love

We reigned like the king and the queen of the land
Everyone wanted some of what we had then
Yeah, we were the ones they all talked about
Like we were the fire that would never go out

It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough
It was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
It was love

We knew it was coming, still, it came way too soon
Neither one knew what to say or to do
So, we just let the radio play while we danced
We laughed and we cried like I never have since

It came in like a flood over the gate
Swallowed us up and it swept us away
We were over our heads, me and that girl
We were out of our minds, it was out of this world
It was always too much, it was never enough

Reflectin' off this bottle in my hand
When I get to the bottom of it
I got five more in that bucket
To get me free as can be like the breeze off the sugar sand

Back on the mainland when you left
Out here, I can clear my mind and the wind can fill my sails

Closer to where I need to be
Six Mexican beers between ""wish you were here"" and ""wish you well""

You know these dark-haired senoritas
They sure know how to treat ya
Ain't sure what they're sayin' but I'm hangin' on every word

And there ain’t no rhyme or reason why
It comes right at you so you do what you do

Love’s great until it’s not
Hearts break but the world don’t stop
When it rains, man, it pours you can’t change the course
You can wish on a star but if it ain’t in the cards

Let it go, sometimes you gotta let it go
Let it all wash on under the bridge, blow it a kiss
Give it a rest 'cause it is what it is

Time flies while you save it all up
But someday this will all be dust
It’s all just stuff, it ain’t ever enough
And you can’t take it with you so you might as well just

Let it go, yeah you really oughta let it go
Let it all wash on under the bridge, blow it a kiss
Give it a rest 'cause it is what it is

You never know
What’s waiting just up the road
Sooner or later that sun’s gonna shine
Luck will turn on a dime
So when the good times roll let ‘em roll
But when they don’t
Let it go

Move on, keep moving ‘til you see the light
The one that you’ve been waiting on
Shining bright in the night
Saying hey there friend where the hell have you been

Let it go, you really gotta let it go
Let it all wash on under the bridge, blow it a kiss
Give it a rest 'cause it is what it is

You never know
What’s waiting just up the road
Sooner or later that sun’s gonna shine
Luck will turn on a dime
And when the good times roll let ‘em roll

George T. Emerson,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

George T. Emerson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Oh, Nadine, baby where are you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you're up to something new

And started walking toward a coffee colored Cadillac
Pushing through the crowd trying to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Seems like every time I catch up with you

I saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
Caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill, told him, ""Catch that yellow cab""

It's the meanest one that we've had yet
Teethed on tin and weaned on gin
I was nobody's teacher's pet

I grew up rough and mean
In my early teens
And I didn't want to go to school
I called no man ""Sir""
Work was a dirty word
My biggest kick was breakin' the rules

Now when I reached twenty one I knew the time had come
I had that old ramblin' itch
Breaking little girls hearts I tore the world apart

Born to be bad

Doin' things wrong was my way of doin' things right

They threw me on a freight train and hauled me back
Had no friend who'd go my bail

They stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail

I saw the sheriff comin' down the line

Said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court
Into the courtroom my trial began

Where I was judged by twelve honest men
Yes as the jury started walkin' out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes then walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree

I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me

George Thorogood,"Want to tell you a story
About the house-man blues
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady I'da lost my job

She said that don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady
I said you let me slide?
I'll have the rent for you in a month
Next I don't know

So said let me slide it on
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me
But for five year she was so nice

Loh' she was lovy-dovy
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said
You got the rent money yet?

I said no, can't find no job
Therefore I ain't got no money
To pay the rent
She said I don't believe

You're tryin' to find no job
Said I seen you today you was standin' on a corner
Leaning up against a post
I said but I'm tired,

I've been walkin' all day
She said that don't concern me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent

And out the door I went
So I go down the streets
Down to my good friend's house
I said look man

I'm outdoors you know
Can I stay with you maybe a couple days?
He said let me go and ask my wife
He come out of the house

I could see it in his face
I know that was no
He said I don't know man
Ah she kinda funny, you know

I said I know,
Everybody funny, now you funny too
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job,

I'm gonna pay the rent
She said yeah? I said oh yeah
And then she was so nice
Loh' she was lovy-dovy

So I go in my room,
Pack up my things and I go
I slip on out the back door
And down the streets I go

She a-howlin' about the front rent,
She'll be lucky to get any back rent
She ain't gonna get none of it
So I stop in the local bar you know people

I go to the bar, I ring my coat,
I call the bartender
Said look man, come down here,
He got down there

So what you want?
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
Well I ain't seen my baby
Since I don't know when

Scotch and gin
Gonna get high man I'm gonna get loose
Need me a triple shot of that juice

Gonna get drunk don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon,
One scotch and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

But I'm sitting now at the bar
I'm getting drunk, I'm feelin' mellow

Looked down the bar,

George Tipton,"And so you say just the words, 
That you wanted us to hear 
Doctored prose for the world, 
While you help us breed our fears 
But you're not winning, some are grinning, 
Realising that it's just a lesson, 
Every empire had had its day, 
And in the end someone has always paid 

We are all one,
Despite governments 
And we are strong,
Our time is gonna come 

How can you even dare 
To look your brother in the eye? 
You're part of it all, 
That we choose not to let into our hearts 
Old man evil, down comes your steeple 
And your friends are nowhere to be found 
Who will help you, 
When you falter and the truth comes crashing all around you? 

We are all one,
Despite governments 
And we are strong,
Our time is gonna come 

Until a child 
Can grow up without mines or bombs 
Until the smallest standard 
Is set for all of us 
Until the fear patrol 
Has lost all that it owns 
Until the corporate sons 
See that it's time to overturn 

We are all One, 
Despite governments 
And we are strong, 
Our time is gonna come 
Your time is gonna come..",One

Love is being a shade from the sun and heat to rest in
Love is being a soldier fighting for what you believe in

Love is being a fountain in a desert for you to drink from
Love is seeing a storm and offering protection
Love is the giving of both hands to catch the tears in motion
And love is open

Love is stronger than steal
Still the bad through it all

Love is being a candle that will chase away the darkness
Love is being a strangle to someone that is defense less
Love is praying for those who are searching for forgiveness
And love, love is children

Things I was thinking of.

I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say

Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

My love will last and endure
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you

I'll never stop loving you
Whatever else I may do
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through
I'll never stop wanting you
And when forever is through
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear

What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings

And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

La jambe légère et l'œil polisson

Met sa robe neuve et ses bottillons
Et bras dessus bras dessous vers les frais bocages

Se cachait l'amour et son aiguillon
Et qu'il transperçait les cœurs de leur âge
Les cœurs des chasseurs de papillons

Quand il se fit tendre, elle lui dit ""Je présage
Que c'est pas dans les plis de mon cotillon
Ni dans l'échancrure de mon corsage
Qu'on va à la chasse aux papillons""

Sur sa bouche en feu qui criait ""Sois sage!""
Il posa sa bouche en guise de bâillon
Et ce fut le plus charmant des remue-ménage
Qu'on ait vu de mémoire de papillon

Un volcan dans l'âme, ils revinrent au village
En se promettant d'aller des millions
Des milliards de fois, et même davantage

Que les femelles du canton,
Contemplaient un puissant gorille,
Sans souci du qu'en-dira-t-on.
Avec impudeur, ces commères
Lorgnaient même un endroit précis
Que, rigoureusement ma mère
M'a défendu de nommer ici...
Gare au gorille !...

Où vivait le bel animal
S'ouvre, on n'sait pourquoi. Je suppose

Criait, éperdu : ""Nom de nom !
C'est assommant car le gorille
N'a jamais connu de guenon !""
Dès que la féminine engeance
Sut que le singe était puceau,
Au lieu de profiter de la chance,
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux !
Gare au gorille !...

Celles là même qui, naguère,
Le couvaient d'un il décidé,
Fuirent, prouvant qu'elles n'avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées ;
D'autant plus vaine était leur crainte,
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l'homme dans l'étreinte,
Bien des femmes vous le diront !
Gare au gorille !...

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d'atteinte du singe en rut,
Sauf une vielle décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut;
Voyant que toutes se dérobent,
Le quadrumane accéléra
Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vieille et du magistrat !
Gare au gorille !...

""Bah ! soupirait la centenaire,
Qu'on puisse encore me désirer,
Ce serait extraordinaire,
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré !"" ;
Le juge pensait, impassible,
""Qu'on me prenne pour une guenon,
C'est complètement impossible...""
La suite lui prouva que non !
Gare au gorille !...

Supposez que l'un de vous puisse être,
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre,
Lequel choisirait-il des deux ?
Qu'une alternative pareille,
Un de ces quatres jours, m'échoie,
C'est, j'en suis convaincu, la vieille
Qui sera l'objet de mon choix !
Gare au gorille !...

Mais, par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l'amour vaut son prix,
On sait qu'en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût, ni par l'esprit.
Lors, au lieu d'opter pour la vieille,
Comme l'aurait fait n'importe qui,
Il saisit le juge à l'oreille
Et l'entraîna dans un maquis !
Gare au gorille !...

La suite serait délectable,
Malheureusement, je ne peux
Pas la dire, et c'est regrettable,
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu ;
Car le juge, au moment suprême,
Criait : ""Maman !"", pleurait beaucoup,
Comme l'homme auquel, le jour même,
Il avait fait trancher le cou.

Sauf les muets, ça va de soi

Le jour du Quatorze Juillet
Je reste dans mon lit douillet
La musique qui marche au pas
Cela ne me regarde pas
Je ne fais pourtant de tort à personne
En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne

Mais les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Non les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Tout le monde me montre au doigt
Sauf les manchots, ça va de soi

Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux
Poursuivi par un cul-terreux
J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire
Le cul-terreux se r'trouve par terre
Je ne fait pourtant de tort à personne
En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes

Mais les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Non les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Tout le monde se rue sur moi
Sauf les culs-de-jatte, ça va de soi

Pas besoin d'être Jérémie
Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis
S'ils trouv'nt une corde à leur goût
Ils me la passeront au cou
Je ne fait pourtant de tort à personne
En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à Rome

Mais les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Non les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu
Sauf les aveugles, bien entendu!",La Mauvaise Réputation [*]
Georges Brassens,"Quand je vais chez la fleuriste
Je n'achèt' que des lilas
Si ma chanson chante triste
C'est que l'amour n'est plus là

Comm' j'étais, en quelque sorte
Amoureux de ces fleurs-là
Je suis entré par la porte
Par la porte des Lilas

Des lilas, y'en avait guère
Des lilas, y'en avait pas
Z'étaient tous morts à la guerre
Passés de vie à trépas

J'suis tombé sur une belle
Qui fleurissait un peu là
J'ai voulu greffer sur elle
Mon amour pour les lilas

J'ai marqué d'une croix blanche
Le jour où l'on s'envola
Accrochés à une branche
Une branche de lilas

Pauvre amour, tiens bon la barre
Le temps va passer par là
Et le temps est un barbare
Dans le genre d'Attila

Aux cœurs où son cheval passe
L'amour ne repousse pas
Aux quatre coins de l'espace
Il fait le désert sous ses pas

Alors, nos amours sont mortes
Envolées dans l'au-delà
Laissant la clé sous la porte
Sous la porte des Lilas

La fauvette des dimanches
Cell' qui me donnait le la
S'est perchée sur d'autres branches
D'autres branches de lilas

Quand je vais chez la fleuriste
Je n'achèt' que des lilas
Si ma chanson chante triste
C'est que l'amour n'est plus là",Les Lilas
Georges Brassens,"Il pleuvait fort sur la grand-route
Elle cheminait sans parapluie
J'en avais un, volé, sans doute
Le matin même à un ami
Courant alors à sa rescousse
Je lui propose un peu d'abri
En séchant l'eau de sa frimousse
D'un air très doux, elle m'a dit ""oui""

Un petit coin de parapluie
Contre un coin de paradis
Elle avait quelque chose d'un ange
Un petit coin de paradis
Contre un coin de parapluie
Je ne perdais pas au change, pardi

Chemin faisant, que ce fut tendre
D'ouïr à deux le chant joli
Que l'eau du ciel faisait entendre
Sur le toit de mon parapluie
J'aurais voulu, comme au déluge
Voir sans arrêt tomber la pluie
Pour la garder, sous mon refuge
Quarante jours, quarante nuits

Un petit coin de parapluie
Contre un coin de paradis
Elle avait quelque chose d'un ange
Un petit coin de paradis
Contre un coin de parapluie
Je ne perdais pas au change, pardi

Mais bêtement, même en orage
Les routes vont vers des pays
Bientôt le sien fit un barrage
A l'horizon de ma folie
Il a fallu qu'elle me quitte
Après m'avoir dit grand merci
Et je l'ai vue toute petite
Partir gaiement vers mon oubli

Un petit coin de parapluie
Contre un coin de paradis
Elle avait quelque chose d'un ange
Un petit coin de paradis
Contre un coin de parapluie
Je ne perdais pas au change, pardi",Le Paraplucie
Georges Brassens,"Jadis, au lieu du jardin que voici,
C’était la zone et tout ce qui s'ensuit,
Des masures des taudis insolites,
Des ruines pas romaines pour un sou.
Quant à la faune habitant la dessous
C’était la fine fleur c’était l'élite.

La fine fleur, l'élite du pavé.
Des besogneux des gueux des réprouvés,
Des mendiants rivalisant de tares,
Des chevaux de retour des propres à rien,
Ainsi qu'un croque-note, un musicien,
Une épave accrochée à sa guitare.

Adoptée par ce beau monde attendri,
Une petite fée avait fleuri
Au milieu de toute cette bassesse.
Comme on l'avait trouvée près du ruisseau,
Abandonnée en un somptueux berceau,
A tout hasard on l'appelait ""princesse"".

Or, un soir, Dieu du ciel, protégez nous!
La voila qui monte sur les genoux
Du croque-note et doucement soupire,
En rougissant quand même un petit peu
""C'est toi que j'aime et si tu veux tu peux
M'embrasser sur la bouche et même pire""

""Tout beau, princesse arrête un peu ton tir,
J'ai pas tellement l'étoffe du satyre,
Tu a treize ans,j'en ai trente qui sonnent,
Grosse différence et je ne suis pas chaud
Pour tâter d'la paille humide du cachot
Mais croque-not',j'dirais rien à personne""

N'insiste pas fit-il d'un ton railleur,
D'abord tu n'es pas mon genre et d'ailleurs
Mon cœur est déjà pris par une grande""
Alors princesse est partie en courant,
Alors princesse est partie en pleurant,
Chagrine qu'on ait boudé son offrande.

Y a pas eu détournement de mineure,
Le croque-note au matin, de bonne heure,
A l'anglaise a filé dans la charrette
Des chiffonniers en grattant sa guitare.
Passant par là quelques vingt ans plus tard,
Il a le sentiment qu'il le regrette.",La Princesse et le Croque-Notes
Georges Brassens,"J'ai des tombeaux en abondance
des sépultur's à discrétion

avec toujours quelqu'un dedans
j'ai des p'tit's boss's plein les allées
et je suis triste, cependant...
car je n'en ai pas, et ça m'agace
et ça défrise mon blason

j'en possède au père-lachaise
a bagneux, à thiais, à pantin

partout où l'on peut faire un trou
j'ai mêm' des tombeaux en espagne
qu'on me jalouse peu ou prou...
mais j'n'en ai pas la moindre trace
le plus humble petit soupçon
au cimetièr' du montparnasse
a quatre pas de ma maison
le jour des morts, je cours, je vole
je vais infatigablement
de nécropole en nécropole
de pierr' tombale en monument
on m'entrevoit sous un' couronne
d'immortelles à champerret
un peu plus tard, c'est à charonne
qu'on m'aperçoit sous un cyprès...
mais, seul, un fourbe aura l'audace
de dir' : j'l'ai vu à l'horizon
du cimetièr' du montparnasse
a quatre pas de sa maison
devant l'château d'ma grand-tante
la marquise de carabas
ma saint' famille languit d'attente
mourra-t-ell', mourra-t-elle pas ?
l'un veut son or, l'autre veut ses meubles
qui ses bijoux, qui ses bib'lots
qui ses forêts, qui ses immeubles
qui ses tapis, qui ses tableaux...
moi je n'implore qu'une grâce
c'est qu'ell' pass' la morte-saison
au cimetièr' du montparnasse
a quatre pas de ma maison
ainsi chantait, la mort dans l'âme
un jeune homm' de bonne tenue
en train de ranimer la flamme
du soldat qui lui était connu
or, il advint qu'le ciel eut marr' de
l'entendre parler d'ses caveaux
et dieu fit signe à la camarde
de l'expédier rue froidevaux...

Georges Brassens,"Dans les comptes d'apothicaire
Vingt ans, c'est un' somm' de bonheur
Mes vingt ans sont morts à la guerre
De l'autr' côté du champ d'honneur
Si j'connus un temps de chien, certes
C'est bien le temps de mes vingt ans
Cependant, je pleure sa perte
Il est mort, c'était le bon temps

Il est toujours joli, le temps passé
Un' fois qu'ils ont cassé leur pipe
On pardonne à tous ceux qui nous ont offensés
Les morts sont tous des braves types

Bécassine, il t'est souvenu
De notre amour du coin des lèvres

Georges Brassens,"Je serai triste comme un saule
Quand le Dieu qui partout me suit
Me dira, la main sur l'épaule
""Va-t'en voir là-haut si j'y suis""
Alors, du ciel et de la terre
Il me faudra faire mon deuil
Est-il encore debout le chêne
Ou le sapin de mon cercueil

S'il faut aller au cimetière
J'prendrai le chemin le plus long
J'ferai la tombe buissonnière
Je quitterai la vie à reculons
Tant pis si les croque-morts me grondent
Tant pis s'ils me croient fou à lier
Je veux partir pour l'autre monde
Par le chemin des écoliers

Avant d'aller conter fleurette
Aux belles âmes des damnées
Je rêve d'encore une amourette
Je rêve d'encore m'enjuponner
Encore un' fois dire: ""Je t'aime""
Encore un' fois perdre le nord
En effeuillant le chrysanthème
Qui est la marguerite des morts

Dieu veuille que ma veuve s'alarme
En enterrant son compagnon
Et que pour lui faire verser des larmes
Il n'y ait pas besoin d'oignon
Qu'elle prenne en secondes noces
Un époux de mon acabit
Il pourra profiter de mes bottes
Et de mes pantoufles et de mes habits

Qu'il boive mon vin, qu'il aime ma femme
Qu'il fume ma pipe et mon tabac
Mais que jamais - mort de mon âme
Jamais il ne fouette mes chats
Quoique je n'aie pas un atome
Une ombre de méchanceté
S'il fouette mes chats, y a un fantôme
Qui viendra le persécuter

Ici-gît une feuille morte
Ici finit mon testament
On a marque dessus ma porte

Georges Brassens,"J'ai plaqué mon chêne
Comme un saligaud
Mon copain le chêne
Mon alter ego
On était du même bois
Un peu rustique, un peu brut
Dont on fait n'importe quoi
Sauf naturellement les flûtes
J'ai maintenant des frênes
Des arbres de judée
Tous de bonne graine
De haute futaie

Parce que depuis tant d'années
C'était pas une sinécure
De lui voir tout l'temps le nez
Au milieu de la figure
Je bas la campagne
Pour dénicher la
Nouvelle compagne
Valant celles-là
Qui, bien sûr, laissait beaucoup
Trop de pierres dans les lentilles
Mais se pendait à mon cou
Quand j'perdais mes billes

Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû
M'éloigner d' mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû

J'avais une mansarde
Pour tout logement
Avec des lézardes
Sur le firmament
Je l'savais par cœur depuis
Et pour un baiser la course
J'emmenais mes belles de nuits
Faire un tour sur la grande ourse
J'habite plus d'une mansarde
Il peut désormais
Tomber des hall'bardes
Je m'en bats l'œil mais
Mais si quelqu'un monte aux cieux
Moins que moi j'y paie des prunes

Georges Brassens,"Les copains affligés, les copines en pleurs
La boîte à dominos enfouie sous les fleurs
Tout le monde équipé de sa tenue de deuil
La farce était bien bonne et valait le coup d'œil

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
L'enterrement paraissait officiel
Bravo!

Le mort ne chantait pas : ""Ah ! c'qu'on s'emmerde ici !""
Il prenait son trépas à cœur, cette fois-ci
Et les bonshomm's chargés de la levée du corps
Ne chantaient pas non plus ""Saint-Eloi bande encor !""

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le macchabée semblait tout à fait mort

Avec des fess's à claque et des chapeaux pointus
Les commères choisies pour les cordons du poêle
Et nul ne leur criait: ""A poil ! A poil ! A poil !""

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Les pleureuses sanglotaient pour de bon
Bravo 

Le curé n'avait pas un goupillon factice
Un de ces goupillons en forme de phallus
Et quand il y alla de ses de profondis
L'enfant de chœur répliqua pas morpionibus

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le curé venait pas de Camaret
Bravo 

On descendit la bière et je fus bien déçu
La blague maintenant frisait le mauvais goût
Car le mort se laissa jeter la terr' dessus
Sans lever le couvercle en s'écriant ""Coucou !

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le cercueil n'était pas à double fond
Bravo !

Quand tout fut consommé, je leur ai dit : ""Messieurs
Allons faire à présent la tournée des boxons !""
Mais ils m'ont regardé avec de pauvres yeux
Puis ils m'ont embrassé d'une étrange façon

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Leur compassion semblait venir du cœur
Bravo !

Quand je suis ressorti de ce champ de navets
L'ombre de l'ici-gît pas à pas me suivait
Une petite croix de trois fois rien du tout
Faisant, à elle seul', de l'ombre un peu partout

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Les revenants s'en mêlaient à leur tour
Bravo !

J'ai compris ma méprise un petit peu plus tard
Quand, allumant ma pipe avec le faire-part
J'm'aperçus que mon nom, comm' celui d'un bourgeois
Occupait sur la liste une place de choix

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
J'étais le plus proch' parent du défunt

Georges Brassens,"Je vivais à l'écart de la place publique,
Serein, contemplatif, ténébreux, bucolique...
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloir',
Sur mon brin de laurier je dormais comme un loir.
Les gens de bon conseil ont su me fair' comprendre
Qu'à l'homme de la ru' j'avais des compt's à rendre
Et que, sous peine de choir dans un oubli complet,
J' devais mettre au grand jour tous mes petits secrets.

{Refrain:}
Trompettes
De la Renommée,
Vous êtes
Bien mal embouchées !

Manquant à la pudeur la plus élémentaire,
Dois-je, pour les besoins d' la caus' publicitaire,
Divulguer avec qui, et dans quell' position
Je plonge dans le stupre et la fornication ?
Si je publi' des noms, combien de Pénélopes
Passeront illico pour de fieffé's salopes,
Combien de bons amis me r'gard'ront de travers,
Combien je recevrai de coups de revolver !

A toute exhibition, ma nature est rétive,
Souffrant d'un' modesti' quasiment maladive,
Je ne fais voir mes organes procréateurs
A personne, excepté mes femm's et mes docteurs.
Dois-je, pour défrayer la chroniqu' des scandales,
Battre l' tambour avec mes parti's génitales,
Dois-je les arborer plus ostensiblement,
Comme un enfant de ch?ur porte un saint sacrement ?

Une femme du monde, et qui souvent me laisse
Fair' mes quat' voluptés dans ses quartiers d' noblesse,
M'a sournois'ment passé, sur son divan de soi',
Des parasit's du plus bas étage qui soit...
Sous prétexte de bruit, sous couleur de réclame,
Ai-j' le droit de ternir l'honneur de cette dame
En criant sur les toits, et sur l'air des lampions :
"" Madame la marquis' m'a foutu des morpions ! "" ?

Le ciel en soit loué, je vis en bonne entente
Avec le Pèr' Duval, la calotte chantante,
Lui, le catéchumène, et moi, l'énergumèn',
Il me laisse dire merd', je lui laiss' dire amen,
En accord avec lui, dois-je écrir' dans la presse
Qu'un soir je l'ai surpris aux genoux d' ma maîtresse,
Chantant la mélopé' d'une voix qui susurre,
Tandis qu'ell' lui cherchait des poux dans la tonsure ?

Avec qui, ventrebleu ! faut-il que je couche
Pour fair' parler un peu la déesse aux cent bouches ?
Faut-il qu'un' femme célèbre, une étoile, une star,
Vienn' prendre entre mes bras la plac' de ma guitar' ?
Pour exciter le peuple et les folliculaires,
Qui'est-c' qui veut me prêter sa croupe populaire,
Qui'est-c' qui veut m' laisser faire, in naturalibus,
Un p'tit peu d'alpinism' sur son mont de Vénus ?

Sonneraient-ell's plus fort, ces divines trompettes,
Si, comm' tout un chacun, j'étais un peu tapette,
Si je me déhanchais comme une demoiselle
Et prenais tout à coup des allur's de gazelle ?
Mais je ne sache pas qu'ça profite à ces drôles
De jouer le jeu d' l'amour en inversant les rôles,
Qu'ça confère à ma gloire un' onc' de plus-valu',
Le crim' pédérastique, aujourd'hui, ne pai' plus.

Après c'tour d'horizon des mille et un' recettes
Qui vous val'nt à coup sûr les honneurs des gazettes,
J'aime mieux m'en tenir à ma premièr' façon
Et me gratter le ventre en chantant des chansons.
Si le public en veut, je les sors dare-dare,
S'il n'en veut pas je les remets dans ma guitare.

Georges Brassens,"Mourir pour des idées
L'idée est excellente
Moi j'ai failli mourir de ne l'avoir pas eue
Car tous ceux qui l'avaient
Multitude accablante
En hurlant à la mort me sont tombés dessus

Ils ont su me convaincre
Et ma muse insolente
Abjurant ses erreurs se rallie à leur foi
Avec un soupçon de déserve toutefois
Mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente
D'accord, mais de mort lente

Jugeant qu'il n'y a pas
Péril en la demeure
Allons vers l'autre monde en flânant en chemin
Car, à forcer l'allure
Il arrive qu'on meure
Pour des idées n'ayant plus cours le lendemain

Or, s'il est une chose
Amère, désolante
En rendant l'âme à Dieu, c'est bien de constater
Qu'on a fait fausse route, qu'on s'est trompé d'idée
Mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente

Les Saint Jean bouche d'or
Qui prêchent le martyre
Le plus souvent d'ailleurs, s'attardent ici-bas
Mourir pour des idées
C'est le cas de le dire
C'est leur raison de vivre, ils ne s'en privent pas 

Dans presque tous les camps
On en voit qui supplantent
Bientôt Mathusalem dans la longévité
J'en conclus qu'ils doivent se dire
En aparté, ""mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente
D'accord, mais de mort lente""

Des idées réclamant
Le fameux sacrifice 
Les sectes de tout poil en offrent des séquelles 
Et la question se pose
Aux victimes novices 
Mourir pour des idées, c'est bien beau mais lesquelles? 

Et comme toutes sont entre elles ressemblantes 
Quand il les voit venir
Avec leur gros drapeau 
Le sage, en hésitant
Tourne autour du tombeau, ""mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente""

Encore s'il suffisait
De quelques hécatombes 
Pour qu'enfin tout changeât, qu'enfin tout s'arrangeât 
Depuis tant de ""grands soirs"" que tant de têtes tombent 
Au paradis sur terre, on y serait déjà 

Mais l'âge d'or sans cesse
Est remis aux calendes 
Les dieux ont toujours soif, n'en ont jamais assez 
Et c'est la mort, la mort
Toujours recommencée, mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente 

Ô vous, les boutefeuxà
Ô vous les bons apôtres 
Mourez donc les premiers, nous vous cédons le pas 
Mais de grâce, morbleu!
Laissez vivre les autres! 
La vie est à peu près leur seul luxe ici-bas 

Car, enfin, la Camarde
Est assez vigilante 
Elle n'a pas besoin qu'on lui tienne la faux 
Plus de danse macabre
Autour des échafauds, mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente

En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne

Mais les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Non les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Tout le monde me montre au doigt
Sauf les manchots, ça va de soi

Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux
Poursuivi par un cul-terreux
J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire
Le cul-terreux se r'trouve par terre
Je ne fait pourtant de tort à personne
En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes

Mais les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Non les brav's gens n'aiment pas que
L'on suive une autre route qu'eux
Tout le monde se rue sur moi
Sauf les culs-de-jatte, ça va de soi

Pas besoin d'être Jérémie
Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis
S'ils trouv'nt une corde à leur goût
Ils me la passeront au cou
Je ne fait pourtant de tort à personne
En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à Rome

Georges Brassens,"Il avait nom corne d'Aurochs, au gué, au gué
Tout l'monde peut pas s'appeler Durand, au gué, au gué

En le regardant avec un œil de poète
On aurait pu croire à son frontal de prophète
Qu'il avait les grandes eaux de Versailles dans la tête
Corne d'Aurochs

Mais que le bon dieu lui pardonne, au gué, au gué
C'étaient celles du robinet, au gué, au gué

On aurait pu croire en l'voyant penché sur l'onde
Qu'il se plongeait dans des méditations profondes
Sur l'aspect fugitif des choses de se monde
Corne d'Aurochs

C'étaient hélas pour s'assurer, au gué, au gué
Que le vent n'l'avait pas décoiffé, au gué, au gué

Il proclamait à son de trompe à tous les carrefours
""Il n'y a qu'les imbéciles qui sachent bien faire l'amour
La virtuosité c'est une affaire de balourds!""
Corne d'Aurochs

Il potassait à la chandelle, au gué, au gué
Des traités de maintien sexuel, au gué, au gué
Et sur les femmes nues des musées, au gué, au gué
Faisait l'brouillon de ses baisers, au gué, au gué

Et bientôt petit à petit, au gué, au gué
On a tout su, tout su de lui, au gué, au gué

On a su qu'il était enfant de la Patrie
Qu'il était incapable de risquer sa vie
Pour cueillir un myosotis à une fille
Corne d'Aurochs

Qu'il avait un petit cousin, au gué, au gué
Haut placé chez les argousins, au gué, au gué
Et que les jours de pénurie, au gué, au gué
Il prenait ses repas chez lui, au gué, au gué

C'est même en revenant d'chez cet antipathique
Qu'il tomba victime d'une indigestion critique
Et refusa l'secours de la thérapeutique
Corne d'Aurochs

Parce que c'était un Allemand, au gué, au gué
Qu'on devait le médicament, au gué, au gué

Il rendit comme il put son âme machinale
Et sa vie n'ayant pas été originale
L'Etat lui fit des funérailles nationales

Alors sa veuve en gémissant, au gué, au gué
Coucha avec son remplaçant, au gué, au gué",Corne d'Aurochs
Georges Brassens,"Dieu sait que je n'ai pas le fond méchant
Je ne souhaite jamais la mort des gens
Mais si l'on ne mourait plus
Je crèverais de faim sur mon talus
Je suis un pauvre fossoyeur
Les vivants croient que je n'ai pas de remords
A gagner mon pain sur le dos des morts
Mais ça me tracasse et d'ailleurs

Je les enterre à contrecoeur
Je suis un pauvre fossoyeur
Et plus je lâchera bride à mon émoi
Et plus les copains s'amusent de moi
Y me disent: ""Mon vieux par moments
T'as une figure d'enterrement""
Je suis un pauvre fossoyeur
J'ai beau me dire que rien n'est éternel

Je peux pas trouver ça tout naturel
Et jamais je ne parviens
A prendre la mort comme elle vient
Je suis un pauvre fossoyeur

Si du fond de la terre on voit le Bon Dieu
Dis-lui le mal que m'a coûté
La dernière pelleté

Georges Brassens,"Au marché de Brive-la-Gaillarde
A propos de bottes d'oignons
Quelques douzaines de gaillardes
Se crêpaient un jour le chignon
A pied, à cheval, en voiture
Les gendarmes mal inspirés
Vinrent pour tenter l'aventure
D'interrompre l'échauffourée

Or, sous tous les cieux sans vergogne
C'est un usage bien établi
Dès qu'il s'agit de rosser les cognes
Tout le monde se réconcilie
Ces furies perdant tout' mesure
Se ruèrent sur les guignols
Et donnèrent je vous l'assure
Un spectacle assez croquignol

En voyant ces braves pandores
Être à deux doigts de succomber
Moi, je bichais car je les adore
Sous la forme de macchabées
De la mansarde où je réside
J'exitais les farouches bras
Des mégères gendarmicides
En criant ""Hip, hip, hip, hourra!""

Frénétique l'un' d'elles attache
Le vieux maréchal des logis
Et lui fait crier ""Mort aux vaches,
Mort aux lois, vive l'anarchie!""
Une autre fourre avec rudesse
Le crâne d'un de ses lourdauds
Entre ses gigantesques fesses
Qu'elle serre comme un étau

La plus grasse de ses femelles
Ouvrant son corsage dilaté
Matraque à grand coup de mamelles
Ceux qui passent à sa portée
Ils tombent, tombent, tombent, tombent
Et selon les avis compétents
Il paraît que cette hécatombe
Fut la plus belle de tous les temps

Jugeant enfin que leurs victimes
Avaient eu leur content de gnons
Ces furies comme outrage ultime
En retournant à leurs oignons
Ces furies à peine si j'ose
Le dire tellement c'est bas
Leur auraient même coupé les choses
Par bonheur ils n'en avait pas
Leur auraient même coupé les choses
Par bonheur ils n'en avait pas",Hécatombe

Georges Brassens,"Ci-gît au fond de mon cœur une histoire ancienne
Un fantôme, un souvenir d'une que j'aimais
Le temps, à grands coups de faux, peut faire des siennes
Mon bel amour dure encore, et c'est à jamais

J'ai perdu la tramontane
En trouvant Margot
Princesse vêtue de laine
Déesse en sabots
Si les fleurs, le long des routes
S'mettaient à marcher
C'est à la Margot, sans doute
Qu'elles feraient songer
J'lui ai dit: ""De la Madone
Tu es le portrait!""
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
C'était un peu vrai

Qu'il me pardonne ou non
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine
Je suis un voyou

La mignonne allait aux vêpres
Se mettre à genoux
Alors j'ai mordu ses lèvres
Pour savoir leur goût
Elle m'a dit, d'un ton sévère
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais là?""
Mais elle m'a laissé faire
Les filles, c'est comme ça
J'lui ai dit: ""Par la Madone
Reste auprès de moi!""
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
Mais chacun pour soi

Qu'il me pardonne ou non
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine
Je suis un voyou

C'était une fille sage
A ""bouche, que veux-tu?""
J'ai croqué dans son corsage
Les fruits défendus
Elle m'a dit d'un ton sévère
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais là?""
Mais elle m'a laissé faire
Les filles, c'est comme ça
Puis, j'ai déchiré sa robe
Sans l'avoir voulu
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
Je n'y tenais plus!

Qu'il me pardonne ou non
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine
Je suis un voyou

J'ai perdu la tramontane
En perdant Margot
Qui épousa, contre son âme
Un triste bigot
Elle doit avoir à l'heure
A l'heure qu'il est
Deux ou trois marmots qui pleurent
Pour avoir leur lait
Et, moi, j'ai tété leur mère
Longtemps avant eux
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
J'étais amoureux!

D'ailleurs, je m'en fous
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine

Georges Brassens,"En ce temps-là, je vivais dans la lune
Les bonheurs d´ici-bas m´étaient tous défendus
Je semais des violettes et chantais pour des prunes
Et tendais la patte aux chats perdus

Ah ah ah ah putain de toi
Ah ah ah ah ah ah pauvre de moi

Un soir de pluie v´là qu´on gratte à ma porte
Je m´empresse d´ouvrir, sans doute un nouveau chat
Nom de dieu l´beau félin que l´orage m´apporte
C´était toi, c´était toi, c´était toi

Les yeux fendus et couleur pistache
T´as posé sur mon cœur ta patte de velours
Fort heureus´ment pour moi t´avais pas de moustache
Et ta vertu ne pesait pas trop lourd

Au quatre coins de ma vie de bohème
T´as prom´né, t´as prom´né le feu de tes vingt ans
Et pour moi, pour mes chats, pour mes fleurs, mes poèmes
C´était toi la pluie et le beau temps

Mais le temps passe et fauche à l´aveuglette
Notre amour mûrissait à peine que déjà
Tu brûlais mes chansons, crachais sur mes viollettes
Et faisais des misères à mes chats

Le comble enfin, misérable salope
Comme il n´restait plus rien dans le garde-manger
T´as couru sans vergogne, et pour une escalope
Te jeter dans le lit du boucher

C´était fini, t´avais passé les bornes
Et, r´nonçant aux amours frivoles d´ici-bas
J´suis r´monté dans la lune en emportant mes cornes

Georges Brassens,"Venez, vous dont l'œil étincelle
Pour entendre une histoire encor
Approchez: je vous dirai celle
De doña Padilla del Flor
Elle était d'Alanje, où s'entassent
Les collines et les halliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Il est des filles à Grenade
Il en est à Séville aussi
Qui, pour la moindre sérénade
A l'amour demandent merci
Il en est que parfois embrassent
Le soir, de hardis cavaliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Ce n'est pas sur ce ton frivole
Qu'il faut parler de Padilla
Car jamais prunelle espagnole
D'un feu plus chaste ne brilla
Elle fuyait ceux qui pourchassent
Les filles sous les peupliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Elle prit le voile à Tolède
Au grand soupir des gens du lieu
Comme si, quand on n'est pas laide
On avait droit d'épouser Dieu
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent
Les soudards et les écoliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or, la belle à peine cloîtrée
Amour en son cœur s'installa
Un fier brigand de la contrée
Vint alors et dit: ""Me voilà!""
Quelquefois les brigands surpassent
En audace les chevaliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Il était laid: les traits austères
La main plus rude que le gant
Mais l'amour a bien des mystères
Et la nonne aima le brigand
On voit des biches qui remplacent
Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

La nonne osa, dit la chronique
Au brigand par l'enfer conduit
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or quand, dans la nef descendue
La nonne appela le bandit
Au lieu de la voix attendue
C'est la foudre qui répondit
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent
Les amants par Satan liés
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Cette histoire de la novice
Saint Ildefonse, abbé, voulut
Qu'afin de préserver du vice
Les vierges qui font leur salut
Les prieurs la racontassent
Dans tous les couvents réguliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers",La Legende de la Nonne

D´la femm´ d´un agent de police

""Je me fais vieux, gémissait-il
Et, durant le cours de ma vie
J´ai vu bon nombre de nombrils
De toutes les catégories
Nombrils d´femm´s de croqu´-morts, nombrils
D´femm´s de bougnats, d´femm´s de jocrisses
Mais je n´ai jamais vu celui
D´la femm´ d´un agent de police""

""Mon père a vu, comm´ je vous vois
Des nombrils de femm´s de gendarmes

D´ceux des femm´s d´inspecteurs les charmes
Mon fils vit le nombril d´la souris
D´un ministre de la Justice
Et moi, j´n´ai même pas vu l´nombril
D´la femm´ d´un agent de police""

Ainsi gémissait en public
Cet honnête homme vénérable
Quand la légitime d´un flic
Tendant son nombril secourable
Lui dit: ""Je m´en vais mettre fin
A votre pénible supplice
Vous fair´ voir le nombril enfin
D´la femm´ d´un agent de police""

""Alleluia! fit le bon vieux
De mes tourments voici la trêve!
Grâces soient rendues au Bon Dieu
Je vais réaliser mon rêve!""
Il s´engagea, tout attendri
Sous les jupons d´sa bienfaitrice
Braquer ses yeux sur le nombril
D´la femm´ d´un agent de police

Mais, hélas! il était rompu
Par les effets de sa hantise
Et comme il atteignait le but
De cinquante ans de convoitise
La mort, la mort, la mort le prit
Sur l´abdomen de sa complice
Il n´a jamais vu le nombril

Me dévoraient déjà des yeux

Au bout d'un siècle, on m'a jeté
A la porte de la Santé

Je retourne au quartier natal
Baissant le nez, rasant les murs
Mal à l'aise sur mes fémurs
M'attendant à voir les humains
Se détourner de mon chemin

Y'en a un qui m'a dit:""Salut!
Te revoir, on n'y comptait plus""

Georges Brassens,"Il vivait en dehors des chemins forestiers
Ce n'était nullement un arbre de métier
Il n'avait jamais vu l'ombre d'un bûcheron
Ce grand chêne fier sur son tronc

Il eût connu des jours filés d'or et de soie
Sans ses proches voisins, les pires gens qui soient 
Des roseaux mal pensant, pas même des bambous
S'amusant à le mettre à bout

Du matin jusqu'au soir ces petit rejetons
Tout juste cann' à pêch', à peine mirlitons
Lui tournant tout autour chantaient, in extenso
L'histoire du chêne et du roseau

Et, bien qu'il fût en bois, les chênes, c'est courant
La fable ne le laissait pas indifférent
Il advint que lassé d'être en but aux lazzi
Il se résolu à l'exi(l)

A grand-peine il sortit ses grands pieds de son trou
Et partit sans se retourner ni peu ni prou
Mais, moi qui l'ai connu, je sais qu'il en souffrit
De quitter l'ingrate patrie

A l'orée des forêts, le chêne ténébreux
A lié connaissance avec deux amoureux
Grand chêne laisse-nous sur toi graver nos noms
Le grand chêne n'as pas dit non

Quand ils eur'nt épuisé leur grand sac de baisers
Quand, de tant s'embrasser, leurs becs furent usés
Ils ouïrent alors, en retenant des pleurs
Le chêne contant ses malheurs

Grand chên', viens chez nous, tu trouveras la paix
Nos roseaux savent vivre et n'ont aucun toupet
Tu feras dans nos murs un aimable séjour
Arrosé quatre fois par jour

Cela dit, tous les trois se mettent en chemin
Chaque amoureux tenant une racine en main
Comme il semblait content ! Comme il semblait heureux 
Le chêne entre ses amoureux

Au pied de leur chaumière, ils le firent planter
Ce fut alors qu'il commença de déchanter
Car, en fait d'arrosage, il n'eut rien que la pluie
Des chiens levant la patt' sur lui

On a pris tous ses glands pour nourrir les cochons
Avec sa belle écorce on a fait des bouchons
Chaque fois qu'un arrêt de mort était rendu
C'est lui qui héritait du pendu

Puis ces mauvaises gens, vandales accomplis
Le coupèrent en quatre et s'en firent un lit
Et l'horrible mégère ayant des tas d'amants
Il vieillit prématurément

Un triste jour, enfin, ce couple sans aveu
Le passa par la hache et le mit dans le feu
Comme du bois de caisse, amère destinée
Il périt dans la cheminée

Le curé de chez nous, petit saint besogneux
Doute que sa fumée s'élève jusqu'à Dieu
Qu'est-c'qu'il en sait, le bougre, et qui donc lui a dit

M'auraient conduit sur le gibet

Sur la veuve patibulaire
En arrosant la mandragore
L'herbe aux pendus qui revigore
En bénissant avec les pieds
Les ribaudes apitoyées

Il faut se faire une raison

Sur le charnier des Innocents

Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

Trouverais-je les noms, trouverais-je les mots
Pour noter d'infamie cet enfant de chameau
Qu'a choisi son époux pour tromper son amant
Qu'a conduit l'adultère à son point culminant
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

Où donc avais-j'les yeux ? Quoi donc avais-j' dedans ?
Pour pas m'être aperçu depuis un certain temps
Que, quand ell' m'embrassait, ell' semblait moins goulue
Et faisait des enfants qui n'me ressemblaient plus
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

Et pour bien m'enfoncer la corne dans le cœur
Par un raffinement satanique, moqueur
La perfide, à voix haute, a dit à mon endroit
"" Le plus cornard des deux n'est point celui qu'on croit ""
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !

J'ai surpris les Dupont, ce couple de marauds
En train d'recommencer leur hymen à zéro
J'ai surpris ma maîtresse équivoque, ambiguë
En train d'intervertir l'ordre de ses cocus
Ma maîtresse, la traîtresse !",La Traîtresse
Georges Brassens,"Sur ses larges bras étendus,
La forêt où s'éveille Flore,
A des chapelets de pendus
Que le matin caresse et dore.
Ce bois sombre, où le chêne arbore
Des grappes de fruits inouïs
Même chez le Turc et le More,
C'est le verger du roi Louis.

Tous ces pauvres gens morfondus,
Roulant des pensers qu'on ignore,
Dans des tourbillons éperdus
Voltigent, palpitants encore.
Le soleil levant les dévore.
Regardez-les, cieux éblouis,
Danser dans les feux de l'aurore.
C'est le verger du roi Louis.

Ces pendus, du diable entendus,
Appellent des pendus encore.
Tandis qu'aux cieux, d'azur tendus,
Où semble luire un météore,
La rosée en l'air s'évapore,
Un essaim d'oiseaux réjouis
Par-dessus leur tête picore.
C'est le verger du roi Louis.

Prince, il est un bois que décore
Un tas de pendus enfouis
Dans le doux feuillage sonore.
C'est le verger du toi Louis !",Le Verger du Roi Louis
Georges Brassens,"Tant qu'elle a besoin du matou,
Ma chatte est tendre comme tout,
Quand elle est comblée, aussitôt
Ell' griffe, ell' mord, ell' fait l'gros dos.

{Refrain:}
Quand vous ne nous les caressez
Pas, chéries, vous nous les cassez.
Oubliez-les, si fair' se peut,
Qu'ell's se reposent.
Quand vous nous les dorlotez pas,
Vous nous les passez à tabac.
Oubliez-les, si fair' se peut,
Qu'ell's se reposent un peu,
Qu'ell's se reposent.

Enamourée, ma femme est douce,
Mes amis vous le diront tous.
Après l'étreinte, en moins de deux
Ell' r'devient un bâton merdeux.

Dans l'alcôve, on est bien reçus
Par la voisine du dessus.
Un' fois son désir assouvi,
Ingrate, ell' nous les crucifie.

Quand ell' passe en revue les zouaves
Ma s?ur est câline et suave.
Dès que s'achève l'examen,
Gare à qui tombe sous sa main.

Si tout le monde en ma maison
Reste au lit plus que de raison,
C'est pas qu'on soit lubriqu's, c'est qu'il
Y a guère que là qu'on est tranquilles.

Il lui parlait de tirant d'eau,
De voiles, de mâts de misaine,
De yacht, de brick et de steamer,

Si l'homme était un peu bigot,
Lui qui sentait fort le fagot,
Criblait le ciel de patenôtres,
Communiait à grand fracas,
Retirant même en certains cas
L'pain bénit d'la bouche d'un autre.

Si l'homme était sergent de ville,
En sautoir - mon Dieu, que c'est vil -
Il portait un flic en peluche,
Lui qui, sans ménager sa voix,
Criait : ""Mort aux vaches"" autrefois,
Même atteint de la coqueluche.

Si l'homme était un militant,
Il prenait sa carte à l'instant
Pour bien se mettre dans sa manche,
Biffant ses propres graffiti

Ont toujours été de mon goût,
Et je suis bien malheureux, car de
Nos jours on n'en crée plus beaucoup.

J'en ai fait une, putain de moine,
Plaise à Dieu qu'elle plaise aux copains. {2x}

Ancienne enfant d'Marie-salope
Mélanie, la bonne au curé,
Dedans ses trompes de Fallope,
S'introduit des cierges sacrés.
Des cierges de cire d'abeille
Plus onéreux, mais bien meilleurs, {2x}
Dame! la qualité se paye
A Saint-Sulpice, comme ailleurs. {2x}

Quand son bon maître lui dit : ""Est-ce
Trop vous demander Mélanie,
De n'user, par délicatesse,
Que de cierges non encore bénits ?""
Du tac au tac, elle réplique
Moi, je préfère qu'ils le soient, {2x}
Car je suis bonne catholique
Elle a raison, ça va de soi. {2x}

Elle vous emprunte un cierge à Pâques
Vous le rend à la Trinité.
Non, non, non, ne me dites pas que
C'est normal de tant le garder.
Aux obsèques d'un con célèbre,
Sur la bière, ayant aperçu, {2x}
Un merveilleux cierge funèbre,
Elle partit à cheval dessus. {2x}

Son mari, pris dans la tempête
La Paimpolaise était en train
De vouer, c'était pas si bête,
Un cierge au patron des marins.
Ce pieux flambeau qui vacille
Mélanie se l'est octroyé, {2x}
Alors le saint, cet imbécile,
Laissa le marin se noyer. {2x}

Les bons fidèles qui désirent
Garder pour eux, sur le chemin
Des processions, leur bout de cire
Doiv'nt le tenir à quatre mains,
Car quand elle s'en mêl', sainte vierge,
Elle cause un désastre, un malheur. {2x}
La Saint-Barthélemy des cierges,
C'est le jour de la Chandeleur. {2x}

Souvent quand elle les abandonne,
Les cierges sont périmés;
La saint' famill' nous le pardonne
Plus moyen de les rallumer.
Comme ell' remue, comme elle se cabre,
Comme elle fait des soubresauts, {2x}
En retournant au candélabre,
Ils sont souvent en p'tits morceaux. {2x}

Et comme elle n'est pas de glace,
Parfois quand elle les restitue
Et qu'on veut les remettre en place,
Ils sont complètement fondus.
Et comme en outre elle n'est pas franche,
Il arrive neuf fois sur dix {2x}
Qu'sur un chandelier à sept branches
Elle n'en rapporte que six. {2x}

Mélanie à l'heure dernière
A peu de chances d'être élue;
Aux culs bénits de cett' manière
Aucune espèce de salut.
Aussi, chrétiens, mes très chers frères,
C'est notre devoir, il est temps, {2x}
De nous employer à soustraire
Cette âme aux griffes de Satan. {2x}

Et je propose qu'on achète
Un cierge abondamment béni
Qu'on fera brûler en cachette
En cachette de Mélanie.
En cachette car cette salope
Serait fichue d'se l'enfoncer {2x}
Dedans ses trompes de Fallope,
Et tout s'rait à recommencer. {2x}",Melanie
Georges Brassens,"Anticlérical fanatique
Gros mangeur d'écclésiastiques,
Cet aveu me coûte beaucoup,
Mais ces hommes d'Eglise, hélas !
Ne sont pas tous des dégueulasses,
Témoin le curé de chez nous.

Quand la foule qui se déchaîne
Pendit un homme au bout d'un chêne
Sans forme aucune de remords,
Ce ratichon fit scandale
Et rugit à travers les stalles,
""Mort à toute peine de mort!""

Puis, on le vit, étrange rite,
Qui baptisait les marguerites
Avec l'eau de son bénitier
Et qui prodiguait les hosties,
Le pain bénit, l'Eucharistie,
Aux petits oiseaux du moutier.

Ensuite, il retroussa ses manches,
Prit son goupillon des dimanches
Et, plein d'une sainte colère,
Il partit comme à l'offensive
Dire une grand' messe exclusive
A celui qui dansait en l'air.

C'est à du gibier de potence
Qu'en cette triste circonstance
L'Hommage sacré fut rendu.

Bonne aubaine pour le touriste,
Eté joué par un pendu.

Et maintenant quand on croasse,
Nous, les païens de sa paroisse,

Comme jadis a fait un roi,
Il serait bien fichu, je crois,
De donner le trône et le reste

Bancal, vieux, borgne, fatigué,
C'est un modeste.

Suivi de son pin parasol,
S'il fuit sans mêm' toucher le sol
Le moindre effort comme la peste,
C'est qu'au chantier ses bras d'Hercule

Si d'aventure il te conteste.
S'il te boude, s'il te rudoie,
Au fond, il est content pour toi,

Si, quand un emmerdeur le met
En rogne, on ne le voit jamais
Lever sur l'homme une main leste.
C'est qu'il juge pas nécessaire
D'humilier un adversaire,
C'est un modeste.

Et quand il tombe amoureux fou
Y a pas de danger qu'il l'avoue
Les effusions, dame, il déteste.
Selon lui, mettre en plein soleil
Son cœur ou son cul c'est pareil,
C'est un modeste.

Quand on enterre un imbécile
De ses amis, s'il raille, s'il

Sur la patate, il en a gros,

Et s'il te traite d'étranger
Que tu sois de Naples, d'Angers
Ou d'ailleurs, remets pas la veste.
Lui, quand il t'adopte, pardi!
Il veut pas que ce soit le dit,

Entre les faits, entre les gestes.

Mais elle avait changé de ton
Quand j'ai demandé: Que dit-on
Des affaires courantes
Dans la ville de Nantes
La mignonne m'a répondu
On dit que vous serez pendu
Aux matines sonnantes

Voulant mener à bonne fin
Ma folle course vagabonde
Vers mes pénates je revins
Pour dormir auprès de ma blonde
Mais elle avait changé de ton
Avec elle, sous l'édredon
Il y avait du monde
Dormant près de ma blonde
J'ai pris le coup d'un air blagueur
Mais, en cachette, dans mon cur
La peine était profonde

Enfin, je vins au monde et, depuis, je lui voue
Un culte véritable et, quand je perds aux boules
En embrassant Fanny, je ne pense qu'à vous

Qui n'emmerdait personne avec sa barbe blanche
Et quand le bruit courut qu'ses jours étaient comptés
On s'en fut à l'hospice afin de l'assister

On avait apporté les guitars avec nous
Car, devant la musique, il tombait à genoux
Excepté toutefois les marches militaires

Sur un fleuve inconnu

Et tous sont ainsi faits

Toujours pour ces gens là
Cela n'est point hideux

En forme de triangle

Ce sont les sauvages
Ils vont où leur desir
Le veut par dessus monts

Et loin des esclavages

Ont aussi femme et mère
Et savent les aimer
Aussi bien que vous, mieux

Pour choyer cette femme

Georges Brassens,"Voilà les feuilles sans sève qui tombent sur le gazon
Voilà le vent qui s'élève et gémit dans le vallon
Voilà l'errante hirondelle qui rase du bout de l'aile
L'eau dormante des marais voilà l'enfant des chaumières
Qui glane sur les bruyères le bois tombé des forêts

C'est la saison où tout tombe aux coups redoublés des vents
Un vent qui vient de la tombe moissonne aussi les vivants
Ils tombent alors par mille comme la plume inutile
Que l'aigle abandonne aux  5a8 airs lorsque des plumes nouvelles
Viennent réchauffer ses ailes à l'approche des hivers

C'est alors que ma paupière vous vit palir et mourir
Tendres fruits qu'à la lumière dieu n'a pas laissé murir
Quoique jeune sur la terre je suis dejà solitaire
Parmi ceux de ma saison et quand je dis en moi-même
""où sont ceux que ton cœur aime?"" Je regarde le gazon

C'est un ami de l'enfance qu'aux jours sombres du malheur
Nous prêta la providence pour appuyer notre cœur
Il n'est plus, notre âme est veuve il nous suit dans notre épreuve
Et nous dit avec pitié, ""Ami si ton âme est pleine
De ta joie ou de ta peine qui portera la moitié?""

C'est une jeune fiancée qui, le front ceint du bandeau
N'emporta qu'une pensée de sa jeunesse au tombeau
Triste, hélas ! dans le ciel même pour revoir celui qu'elle aime
Elle revient sur ses pas et lui dit, ""Ma tombe est verte
Sur cette terre déserte qu'attends-tu? je n'y suis pas""

C'est l'ombre pâle d'un père qui mourut en nous nommant
C'est une sœur, c'est un frère qui nous devance un moment
Tous ceux enfin dont la vie un jour ou l'autre ravie, emport 548
E une part de nous murmurent sous la pierre
""Vous qui voyez la lumière de nous vous souvenez vous?""

Voilà les feuilles sans sève qui tombent sur le gazon
Voilà le vent qui s'élève et gémit dans le vallon
Voilà l'errante hirondelle qui rase du bout de l'aile
L'eau dormante des marais voilà l'enfant des chaumières
Qui glane sur les bruyères le bois tombé des forêts

",Pensees des Morts
Georges Brassens,"Tous les cœurs se rallient à sa blanche cornette
Si le chrétien succombe à son charme insidieux
Le païen le plus sûr, l'athée le plus honnête
Se laisseraient aller parfois à croire en Dieu
Et les enfants de chœur font tinter leur sonnette

Il paraît que, dessous sa cornette fatale
Qu'elle arbore à la messe avec tant de rigueur
Cette petite sœur cache, c'est un scandale
Une queu' de cheval et des accroche-cœurs
Et les enfants de chœur s'agitent dans les stalles

Il paraît que, dessous son gros habit de bure
Elle porte coquettement des bas de soie
Festons, frivolités, fanfreluches, guipures
Enfin tout ce qu'il faut pour que le diable y soit
Et les enfants de chœur ont des pensées impures

Il paraît que le soir, en voici bien d'une autre!
A l'heure où ses consœurs sont sagement couchées
Ou débitent pieusement des patenôtres
Elle se déshabille devant sa psyché
Et les enfants de chœur ont la fièvre, les pauvres

Il paraît qu'à loisir elle se mire nue
De face, de profil, et même, hélas! de dos
Après avoir, sans gêne, accroché sa tenue
Aux branches de la croix comme au portemanteau
Chez les enfants de chœur le malin s'insinue

Il paraît que, levant au ciel un œil complice
Elle dit: ""Bravo, Seigneur, c'est du joli travail!""
Puis qu'elle ajoute avec encor plus de malice 
""La cambrure des reins, ça, c'est une trouvaille!""
Et les enfants de chœur souffrent un vrai supplice

Il paraît qu'à minuit, bonne mère, c'est pire 
On entend se mêler, dans d'étranges accords
La voix énamourée des anges qui soupirent
Et celle de la sœur criant ""Encor! Encor!""
Et les enfants de chœur, les malheureux, transpirent

Et monsieur le curé, que ces bruits turlupinent
Se dit avec raison que le brave Jésus
Avec sa tête, hélas! déjà chargée d'épines
N'a certes pas besoin d'autre chose dessus
Et les enfants de chœur, branlant du chef, opinent

Tout ça, c'est des faux bruits, des ragots, des sornettes
De basses calomnies par Satan répandues
Pas plus d'accroche-cœurs sous la blanche cornette
Que de queue de cheval, mais un crâne tondu
Et les enfants de chœur en font, une binette

Pas de troubles penchants dans ce cœur rigoriste
Sous cet austère habit pas de rubans suspects
On ne verra jamais la corne au front du Christ
Le veinard sur sa croix peut s'endormir en paix
Et les enfants de chœur se masturber, tout tristes",La Religieuse
Georges Brassens,"Cette rose avait glissé de
La gerbe qu'un héros gâteux
Portait au monument aux Morts

Comme tous les gens levaient leurs
Yeux pour voir hisser les couleurs

Et je repris ma route et m'en allai quérir
Au p'tit bonheur la chance, un corsage à fleurir
Car c'est une des pir's perversions qui soient
Que de garder une rose par-devers soi

Gisait, oubliée, en chemin
Par deux amis fâchés à mort

Quelque peu décontenancé'

Et je repris ma route avec l'intention
De faire circuler la virile effusion
Car c'est une des pir's perversions qui soient
Qu' de garder une poigné' de main par-devers soi

Le premier m'a dit: ""Fous le camp !
J'aurais peur de salir mes gants.""
Le deuxième, d'un air dévot
Me donna cent sous, d'ailleurs faux

Si le troisième, ours mal léché
Dans ma main tendue a craché
Le quatrième, c'est plus méchant
Se mit en quête d'un agent

Plus de bandeau sur l'il et d'un huissier modèle

De nos affaires de cur, il s'était mis en route
Pour recouvrer tout son fourbi

Pas plus tôt descendu de sa noire calèche
Il nous a dit : ""je viens récupérer mes flèches

Et, pour la bouche gourmande

Je faisais pousser des amandes

Dans un bond
Vint me dire ""Je suis gourmande
Et mes lèvres sentent bon
Et, si tu me donnes une amande
Je te donne un baiser fripon!""

""Grimpe aussi haut que tu veux
Que tu peux et tu croques, et tu picores
Puis tu grignotes, et puis tu

Plus aveugles que moi dans tous les âges
Mais faut dire que je m'étais creuvé les yeux
En regardant de trop près son corsage

Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Ne savais plus où donner de la bouche

Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Elle n'avait pas de tête, elle n'avait pas
L'esprit beaucoup plus grand qu'un dé à coudre
Mais pour l'amour on ne demande pas
Aux filles d'avoir inventé la poudre

Une jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Puis un jour elle a pris la clef des champs
En me laissant à l'âme un mal funeste
Et toutes les herbes de la Saint-Jean
N'ont pas pu me guérir de cette peste

J'lui en ai bien voulu, mais à présent
J'ai plus d'rancune et mon cœur lui pardonne
D'avoir mis mon cœur à feu et à sang
Pour qu'il ne puisse plus servir à personne

Georges Brassens,"Moi, mes amours d'antan c'était de la grisette
Margot, la blanche caille, et Fanchon, la cousette...

C'étaient, me direz-vous, des grâces roturières,
Des nymphes de ruisseau, des Vénus de barrière...
Mon prince, on a les dam's du temps jadis - qu'on peut...

Car le cœur à vingt ans se pose où l'œil se pose,
Le premier cotillon venu vous en impose,
La plus humble bergère est un morceau de roi.
Ça manquait de marquise, on connut la soubrette,
Faute de fleur de lys on eut la pâquerette,
Au printemps Cupidon fait flèche de tout bois...

On rencontrait la belle aux Puces, le dimanche :
""Je te plais, tu me plais..."" et c'était dans la manche,
Et les grands sentiments n'étaient pas de rigueur.
""Je te plais, tu me plais. Viens donc beau militaire""
Dans un train de banlieue on partait pour Cythère,
On n'était pas tenu même d'apporter son cœur...

Mimi, de prime abord, payait guère de mine,
Chez son fourreur sans doute on ignorait l'hermine,
Son habit sortait point de l'atelier d'un dieu...
Mais quand, par-dessus le moulin de la Galette,
Elle jetait pour vous sa parure simplette,
C'est Psyché tout entier' qui vous sautait aux yeux.

Au second rendez-vous y' avait parfois personne,
Elle avait fait faux bond, la petite amazone,
Mais l'on ne courait pas se pendre pour autant...
La marguerite commence avec Suzette,
On finissait de l'effeuiller avec Lisette
Et l'amour y trouvait quand même son content.

C'étaient, me direz-vous, des grâces roturières,
Des nymphes de ruisseau, des Vénus de barrière,
Mais c'étaient mes amours, excusez-moi du peu,
Des Manon, des Mimi, des Suzon, des Musette,
Margot la blanche caille, et Fanchon, la cousette,
Mon prince, on a les dam's du temps jadis - qu'on peut...",Les Amours d'Antan

Georges Brassens,"Un champ de blé prenait racine
Sous la coiffe de Bécassine,
Ceux qui cherchaient la toison d'or
Ailleurs avaient bigrement tort.
Tous les seigneurs du voisinage,
Les gros bonnets, grands personnages,
Rêvaient de joindre à leur blason
Une boucle de sa toison.

N'ayant pas l'ombre d'un lopin,
Qu'elle laissa pendre, vainqueur,
Au bout de ses accroche-cœurs.

Deux pervenches prenaient racine,
Si belles que Sémiramis
Ne s'en est jamais bien remis'.
Et les grands noms à majuscules,
Les Cupidons à particules
Auraient cédé tous leurs acquêts
En échange de ce bouquet.
Au fond des yeux de Bécassine
Deux pervenches prenaient racine.

C'est une espèce de gredin,
N'ayant pas l'ombre d'un jardin,
Un soupirant de rien du tout
Qui lui fit faire les yeux doux.
C'est une sorte de manant,
Un amoureux du tout-venant
Qui pourra chanter la chanson
Des fleurs bleu's en toute saison
Et jusqu'à l'heure du trépas,

A sa bouche, deux belles guignes,
Deux cerises tout à fait dignes,
Tout à fait dignes du panier
De madame de Sévigné.
Les hobereaux, les gentillâtres,
Tombés tous fous d'elle, idolâtres,
Auraient bien mis leur bourse à plat
Pour s'offrir ces deux guignes-là,
Tout à fait dignes du panier
De madame de Sévigné.

C'est une espèce d'étranger,
N'ayant pas l'ombre d'un verger,
Qui fit s'ouvrir, qui étrenna
Ses joli's lèvres incarnat.

Qui pourra chanter la chanson
Du temps des ceris's en tout' saison
Et jusqu'à l'heure du trépas,

Georges Brassens,"J'ai perdu mes bajou's, j'ai perdu ma bedaine,
Et, ce, d'une façon si nette, si soudaine,
Qu'on me suppose un mal qui ne pardonne pas,
Qui se rit d'Esculape et le laisse baba.

Le monstre do Loch Ness ne faisant plus recette
Durant les moments creux dans certaines gazettes,
Systématiquement, les nécrologues jou'nt,
À me mettre au linceul sous des feuilles de chou.

Or, lassé de servir de tête de massacre,
Des contes à mourir debout qu'on me consacre,
Moi qui me porte bien, qui respir' la santé,
Je m'avance et je cri' toute la vérité.

Toute la vérité, messieurs, je vous la livre
Si j'ai quitté les rangs des plus de deux cents livres,
see'est la faute à Mimi, à Lisette, à Ninon,
Et bien d'autres, j'ai pas la mémoire des noms.

Si j'ai trahi les gros, les joufflus, les obèses,
see'est que je baise, que je baise, que je baise
Comme un bouc, un bélier, une bête, une brut',
Je suis hanté : le rut, le rut, le rut, le rut !

Qu'on me comprenne bien, j'ai l'âme do satyre
Et son comportement, mais ça ne veut point dire
Que j'en ai' le talent, le géni', loin s'en faut !
Pas une seule encor' ne m'a crié "" bravo ! ""

Entre autres fines fleurs, je compte, sur ma liste
Rose, un bon nombre de femmes de journalistes
Qui, me pensant fichu, mettent toute leur foi
A m'donner do bonheur une dernière fois.

see'est beau, see'est généreux, see'est grand, see'est magnifique !
Et, dans les positions les plus pornographiques,
Je leur rends les honneurs à fesses rabattu's
Sur des tas de bouillons, des paquets d'invendus.

Et voilà ce qui fait que, quand vos légitimes
Montrent leurs fesse' au peuple ainsi qu'à vos intimes,
On peut souvent why lire, imprimés à l'envers,
Les échos, les petits potins, les faits divers.

Et si vous entendez sourdre, à travers les plinthes
do boudoir de ces dam's, des râles et des plaintes,
Ne dites pas : ""see'est tonton Georges qui expire "",
Ce sont tout simplement les anges qui soupirent.

Et si vous entendez crier comme en quatorze :
""Debout ! Debout les morts ! "" ne bombez pas le torse,
see'est l'épouse exalté' d'un rédacteur en chef
Qui m'incite à monter à l'assaut derechef.

Certe', il m'arrive bien, revers de la médaille,
De laisser quelquefois des plum's à la bataille...
Hippocrate dit : "" Oui, see'est des crêtes de coq"",
Et Gallien répond ""Non, see'est des gonocoqu's... ""

Tous les deux ont raison. Vénus parfois vous donne
De méchants coups de pied qu'un bon chrétien pardonne,
Car, s'ils causent do tort aux attributs virils,
Ils mettent rarement l'existence en péril.

Eh bien, oui, j'ai tout ça, rançon de mes fredaines.

Georges Brassens,"Un bon petit diable à la fleur de l'âge
La jambe légère et l'œil polisson
Et la bouche pleine de joyeux ramages
Allait à la chasse aux papillons

Comme il atteignait l'orée du village
Filant sa quenouille, il vit Cendrillon
Il lui dit : ""Bonjour, que Dieu te ménage
J't'emmène à la chasse aux papillons""

Cendrillon ravie de quitter sa cage
Met sa robe neuve et ses botillons
Et bras d'ssus bras d'ssous vers les frais bocages
Ils vont à la chasse aux papillons

Il ne savait pas que sous les ombrages
Se cachait l'amour et son aiguillon
Et qu'il transperçait les cœurs de leur âge
Les cœurs des chasseurs de papillons

Quand il se fit tendre, elle lui dit : ""J'présage
Qu'c'est pas dans les plis de mon cotillon
Ni dans l'échancrure de mon corsage
Qu'on va à la chasse aux papillons""

Sur sa bouche en feu qui criait : ""Sois sage !""
Il posa sa bouche en guise de bâillon
Et c'fut l'plus charmant des remue-ménage
Qu'on ait vu d'mémoir' de papillon

Un volcan dans l'âme, ils r'vinrent au village
En se promettant d'aller des millions
Des milliards de fois, et mêm' davantage
Ensemble à la chasse aux papillons

Porteurs de chagrins, les épargneront

Georges Brassens,"Comme elle n'aime pas beaucoup la solitude
Cependant que je pêche et que je m'ennoblis
Ma femme sacrifie à sa vieille habitude
De faire, à tout venant, les honneurs de mon lit

Eh ! oui, je suis cocu, j'ai du cerf sur la tête
On fait force de trous dans ma lune de miel
Ma bien-aimée ne m'invite plus à la fête
Quand ell' va faire un tour jusqu'au septième ciel

Au péril de mon cœur, la malheureuse écorne
Le pacte conjugal et me le déprécie
Que je ne sache plus où donner de la corne
Semble bien être le cadet de ses soucis

Les galants de tout poil viennent boire en mon verre
Je suis la providence des écornifleurs
On cueille dans mon dos la tendre primevère
Qui tenait le dessus de mon panier de fleurs

En revenant fourbu de la pêche à la ligne
Je les surprends tout nus dans leurs débordements
Conseillez-leur le port de la feuille de vigne
Ils s'y refuseront avec entêtement

Souiller mon lit nuptial, est-c' que ça les empêche
De garder les dehors de la civilité ?
Qu'on me demande au moins si j'ai fait bonne pêche
Qu'on daigne s'enquérir enfin de ma santé

De grâce, un minimum d'attentions délicates
Pour ce pauvre mari qu'on couvre de safran
Le cocu, d'ordinaire, on le choie, on le gâte
On est en fin de compte un peu de ses parents

A l'heure du repas, mes rivaux détestables
Ont encor ce toupet de lorgner ma portion
Ça leur ferait pas peur de s'asseoir à ma table
Cocu, tant qu'on voudra, mais pas amphitryon

Partager sa moitié, est-c' que cela comporte
Que l'on partage aussi la chère et la boisson ?
Je suis presque obligé de les mettre à la porte
Et bien content s'ils n'emportent pas mes poissons

Bien content qu'en partant ces mufles ne s'égarent
Pas à mettre le comble à leur ignominie

L'un aimait les Tommies, l'autre aimait les Teutons
Chacun, pour ses amis, tous les deux ils sont morts
Moi, qui n'aimais personne, eh bien, je vis encore

Maintenant, chers tontons, que les temps ont coulé
Que vos veuves de guerre ont enfin convolé
Que l'on a requinqué, dans le ciel de Verdun
Les étoiles ternies du maréchal Pétain

Maintenant que vos controverses se sont tues
Qu'on s'est bien partagé les cordes des pendus
Maintenant que John Bull nous boude, maintenant
Que c'en est fini des querelles d'Allemand

Que vos fill's et vos fils vont, la main dans la main
Faire l'amour ensemble et l'Europ' de demain
Qu'ils se soucient de vos batailles presque autant
Que l'on se souciait des guerres de Cent Ans

Que, de vos vérités, vos contrevérités
Tout le monde s'en fiche à l'unanimité

De vos épurations, vos collaborations
Vos abominations et vos désolations
De vos plats de choucroute et vos tasses de thé
Tout le monde s'en fiche à l'unanimité

Elles ne font plus beaucoup d'ombre, vos deux croix
Et, petit à petit, vous voilà devenus
L'Arc de Triomphe en moins, des soldats inconnus

Maintenant, j'en suis sûr, chers malheureux tontons
Vous, l'ami des Tommies, vous, l'ami des Teutons
Si vous aviez vécu, si vous étiez ici
C'est vous qui chanteriez la chanson que voici

Chanteriez, en trinquant ensemble à vos santés
Qu'il est fou de perdre la vie pour des idées
Des idées comme ça, qui viennent et qui font
Trois petits tours, trois petits morts, et puis s'en vont

Qu'aucune idée sur terre est digne d'un trépas
Qu'il faut laisser ce rôle à ceux qui n'en ont pas
Que prendre, sur-le-champ, l'ennemi comme il vient
C'est de la bouillie pour les chats et pour les chiens

Qu'au lieu de mettre en joue quelque vague ennemi
Mieux vaut attendre un peu qu'on le change en ami
Mieux vaut tourner sept fois sa crosse dans la main
Mieux vaut toujours remettre une salve à demain

Que les seuls généraux qu'on doit suivre aux talons
Ce sont les généraux des p'tits soldats de plomb
Ainsi, chanteriez-vous tous les deux en suivant
Malbrough qui va-t-en guerre au pays des enfants

O vous, qui prenez aujourd'hui la clé des cieux
Vous, les heureux coquins qui, ce soir, verrez Dieu
Quand vous rencontrerez mes deux oncles, là-bas
Offrez-leur de ma part ces ""Ne m'oubliez pas""

Un p'tit vergiss mein nicht pour mon oncle Gaston

Les belles pompes funèbres de nos vingt ans

Plutôt qu'd'avoir des obsèqu's manquant de fioritur's
J'aim'rais mieux, tout compte fait, m'passer de sépultur'
J'aim'rais mieux mourir dans l'eau, dans le feu, n'importe où
Et même, à la grand' rigueur, ne pas mourir du tout
O, que renaisse le temps des morts bouffis d'orgueil
L'époque des m'as-tu-vu-dans-mon-joli-cercueil
Où, quitte à tout dépenser jusqu'au dernier écu
Les gens avaient à cœur d'mourir plus haut qu'leur cul
Les gens avaient à cœur de mourir plus haut que leur cul",Les Funérailles d'Antan
Georges Brassens,"Gaztibelza, l'homme à la carabine
Chantait ainsi:
Quelqu’un a-t-il connu doña Sabine
Quelqu’un d’ici?
Chantez, dansez, villageois! La nuit gagne
Le Mont Falu
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Quelqu’un a-t-il connu Sabine
Ma señora?
Sa mère était la vieille maugrabine
D’Antequera
Qui chaque nuit criait dans la tour Magne
Comme un hibou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Vraiment, la reine eût près d’elle été laide
Quand vers le soir
Elle passait sur le pont de Tolède
En corset noir
Un chapelet du temps de Charlemagne
Ornait son cou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Le roi disait, en la voyant si belle
A son neveu:
Pour un baiser pour un sourire d’elle
Pour un cheveu
Infant don Ruy, je donnerais l’Espagne
Et le Pérou!
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Je ne sais pas si j’aimais cette dame
Mais je sais bien
Que pour avoir un regard de son âme
Moi pauvre chien
J’aurais gaiement passé dix ans au bagne
Sous les verrous
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Quand je voyais cette enfant, moi le pâtre
De ce canton
Je croyais voir la belle Cléopâtre
Qui, nous dit-on
Menait César, empereur d’Allemagne
Par le licou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Dansez, chantez, villageois, la nuit tombe
Sabine un jour
A tout vendu, sa beauté de colombe
Tout son amour
Pour l’anneau d’or du comte de Saldagne
Pour un bijou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
M’a rendu fou",Gastibelza
Georges Brassens,"Du temps que régnait le Grand Pan,
Les dieux protégaient les ivrognes
Des tas de génies titubants
Au nez rouge, à la rouge trogne.
Dès qu'un homme vidait les cruchons,
Qu'un sac à vin faisait carousse
Ils venaient en bande à ses trousses
Compter les bouchons.
La plus humble piquette était alors bénie,
Distillée par Noé, Silène, et compagnie.
Le vin donnait un lustre au pire des minus,
Et le moindre pochard avait tout de Bacchus.

{Refrain:}
Mais en se touchant le crâne, en criant "" J'ai trouvé ""
La bande au professeur Nimbus est arrivée
Qui s'est mise à frapper les cieux d'alignement,
Chasser les Dieux du Firmament.

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les gens boivent encore,
Et le feu du nectar fait toujours luire les trognes.
Mais les dieux ne répondent plus pour les ivrognes.
Bacchus est alcoolique, et le grand Pan est mort.

Quand deux imbéciles heureux
S'amusaient à des bagatelles,
Un tas de génies amoureux

Venaient leur tenir la chandelle.
Du fin fond du champs élysées
Dès qu'ils entendaient un "" Je t'aime "",
Ils accouraient à l'instant même
Compter les baisers.
La plus humble amourette
Etait alors bénie
Sacrée par Aphrodite, Eros, et compagnie.
L'amour donnait un lustre au pire des minus,
Et la moindre amoureuse avait tout de Vénus.

{Refrain}

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les c?urs battent encore,
Et la règle du jeu de l'amour est la même.
Mais les dieux ne répondent plus de ceux qui s'aiment.
Vénus s'est faite femme, et le grand Pan est mort.

Et quand fatale sonnait l'heure
De prendre un linceul pour costume
Un tas de génies l'?il en pleurs
Vous offraient des honneurs posthumes.
Et pour aller au céleste empire,
Dans leur barque ils venaient vous prendre.
C'était presque un plaisir de rendre
Le dernier soupir.
La plus humble dépouille était alors bénie,
Embarquée par Caron, Pluton et compagnie.
Au pire des minus, l'âme était accordée,
Et le moindre mortel avait l'éternité.

{Refrain}

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les gens passent encore,
Mais la tombe est hélas la dernière demeure
Les dieux ne répondent plus de ceux qui meurent.
La mort est naturelle, et le grand Pan est mort.

Et l'un des dernier dieux, l'un des derniers suprêmes,
Ne doit plus se sentir tellement bien lui-même
Un beau jour on va voir le Christ
Descendre du calvaire en disant dans sa lippe
"" Merde je ne joue plus pour tous ces pauvres types.
J'ai bien peur que la fin du monde soit bien triste. """,Le Grand Pan
Georges Brassens,"Jamais sur terre il n'y eut d'amoureux
Plus aveugles que moi dans tous les âges

Un' jolie vach' déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mèn' par le bout du cur

Le ciel l'avait pourvue des mille appas
Qui vous font prendre feu dès qu'on y touche
L'en avait tant que je ne savais pas
Ne savais plus où donner de la bouche

Un' jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Un' jolie vach' déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mèn' par le bout du cur

Ell' n'avait pas de tête, ell' n'avait pas
L'esprit beaucoup plus grand qu'un dé à coudre
Mais pour l'amour on ne demande pas
Aux filles d'avoir inventé la poudre

Un' jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Un' jolie vach' déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mèn' par le bout du cur

Puis un jour elle a pris la clef des champs
En me laissant à l'âme un mal funeste
Et toutes les herbes de la Saint-Jean
N'ont pas pu me guérir de cette peste

J' lui en ai bien voulu, mais à présent
J'ai plus d'rancune et mon cur lui pardonne
D'avoir mis mon cur à feu et à sang
Pour qu'il ne puisse plus servir à personne

Un' jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Un' jolie vach' déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache

Georges Brassens,"Quand je vais chez la fleuriste
Je n'achèt' que des lilas
Si ma chanson chante triste
C'est que l'amour n'est plus là

Comm' j'étais, en quelque sorte
Amoureux de ces fleurs-là
Je suis entré par la porte
Par la porte des Lilas

Des lilas, y'en avait guère
Des lilas, y'en avait pas
Z'étaient tous morts à la guerre
Passés de vie à trépas

J'suis tombé sur une belle
Qui fleurissait un peu là
J'ai voulu greffer sur elle
Mon amour pour les lilas

J'ai marqué d'une croix blanche
Le jour où l'on s'envola
Accrochés à une branche
Une branche de lilas

Pauvre amour, tiens bon la barre
Le temps va passer par là
Et le temps est un barbare
Dans le genre d'Attila

Aux cœurs où son cheval passe
L'amour ne repousse pas
Aux quatre coins de l'espace
Il fait le désert sous ses pas

Alors, nos amours sont mortes
Envolées dans l'au-delà
Laissant la clé sous la porte
Sous la porte des Lilas

Georges Brassens,"Mourir pour des idées
L'idée est excellente
Moi j'ai failli mourir de ne l'avoir pas eue
Car tous ceux qui l'avaient
Multitude accablante
En hurlant à la mort me sont tombés dessus

Ils ont su me convaincre
Et ma muse insolente
Abjurant ses erreurs se rallie à leur foi
Avec un soupçon de déserve toutefois
Mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente
D'accord, mais de mort lente

Jugeant qu'il n'y a pas
Péril en la demeure
Allons vers l'autre monde en flânant en chemin
Car, à forcer l'allure
Il arrive qu'on meure
Pour des idées n'ayant plus cours le lendemain

Or, s'il est une chose
Amère, désolante
En rendant l'âme à Dieu, c'est bien de constater
Qu'on a fait fausse route, qu'on s'est trompé d'idée
Mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente

Les Saint Jean bouche d'or
Qui prêchent le martyre
Le plus souvent d'ailleurs, s'attardent ici-bas
Mourir pour des idées
C'est le cas de le dire
C'est leur raison de vivre, ils ne s'en privent pas 

Dans presque tous les camps
On en voit qui supplantent
Bientôt Mathusalem dans la longévité
J'en conclus qu'ils doivent se dire
En aparté, ""mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente
D'accord, mais de mort lente""

Des idées réclamant
Le fameux sacrifice 
Les sectes de tout poil en offrent des séquelles 
Et la question se pose
Aux victimes novices 
Mourir pour des idées, c'est bien beau mais lesquelles? 

Et comme toutes sont entre elles ressemblantes 
Quand il les voit venir
Avec leur gros drapeau 
Le sage, en hésitant
Tourne autour du tombeau, ""mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente""

Encore s'il suffisait
De quelques hécatombes 
Pour qu'enfin tout changeât, qu'enfin tout s'arrangeât 
Depuis tant de ""grands soirs"" que tant de têtes tombent 
Au paradis sur terre, on y serait déjà 

Mais l'âge d'or sans cesse
Est remis aux calendes 
Les dieux ont toujours soif, n'en ont jamais assez 
Et c'est la mort, la mort
Toujours recommencée, mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente 

Ô vous, les boutefeuxà
Ô vous les bons apôtres 
Mourez donc les premiers, nous vous cédons le pas 
Mais de grâce, morbleu!
Laissez vivre les autres! 
La vie est à peu près leur seul luxe ici-bas 

Car, enfin, la Camarde
Est assez vigilante 
Elle n'a pas besoin qu'on lui tienne la faux 
Plus de danse macabre
Autour des échafauds, mourons pour des idées, d'accord, mais de mort lente 
D'accord, mais de mort lente",Mourir Pour des Idees
Georges Brassens,"Elle n'a pas encor de plumes
La flèche qui doit percer son flanc
Et dans son cœur rien ne s'allume
Quand elle cède à ses galants
Elle se rit bien des gondoles
Des fleurs bleues, des galants discours
Des Vénus de la vieille école
Cell's qui font l'amour par amour

N'allez pas croire davantage
Que le démon brûle son corps
Il s'arrête au premier étage
Son septième ciel, et encor
Elle n'est jamais langoureuse
Passée par le pont des soupirs
Et voit comme des bêtes curieuses
Celles qui font l'amour par plaisir

Croyez pas qu'elle soit à vendre
Quand on l'a mise sur le dos
On n'est pas tenu de se fendre
D'un somptueux petit cadeau
Avant d'aller en bacchanale
Elle présente pas un devis
Elle n'a rien de ces belles vénales
Celles qui font l'amour par profit

Mais alors, pourquoi cède-t-elle
Sans cœur, sans lucre, sans plaisir
Si l'amour vaut pas la chandelle
Pourquoi le joue-t-elle à loisir
Si quiconque peut, sans ambages
L'aider à dégrafer sa robe
C'est parce qu'elle veut être à la page
Que c'est la mode et qu'elle est snob

Mais changent coutumes et filles
Un jour, peut-être, en son sein nu
Va se planter pour toute la vie

Georges Brassens,"Rien n'est jamais acquis à l'homme, ni sa force
Ni sa faiblesse ni son cœur, et quand il croit
Ouvrir ses bras son ombre est celle d'une croix
Et quand il croit serrer son bonheur il le broie
Sa vie est un étrange et douloureux divorce
Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Sa vie elle ressemble à ces soldats sans armes
Qu'on avait habillés pour un autre destin
A quoi peut leur servir de ce lever matin
Eux qu'on retrouve au soir désarmés incertains
Dites ces mots ma vie et retenez vos larmes
Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Mon bel amour, mon cher amour, ma déchirure
Je te porte dans moi comme un oiseau blessé
Et ceux-là sans savoir nous regardent passer
Répétant après moi les mots que j'ai tressés
Et qui pour tes grands yeux tout aussitôt moururent
Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Le temps d'apprendre à vivre il est déjà trop tard
Que pleurent dans la nuit nos cœurs à l'unisson
Ce qu'il faut de malheur pour la moindre chanson
Ce qu'il faut de regrets pour payer un frisson
Ce qu'il faut de sanglots pour un air de guitare
Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne soit à douleur
Il n'y a pas d'amour dont on ne soit meurtri
Il n'y a pas d'amour dont on ne soit flétri
Et pas plus que de toi l'amour de la patrie
Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne vive de pleurs
Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux
Mais c'est notre amour à tous deux",Il  N'Y a Pas d'Amour Heureux

Par les quatre horizons qui crucifient le monde
Par tous ceux dont la chair se déchire ou succombe
Par ceux qui sont sans pieds, par ceux qui sont sans mains
Par le malade que l'on opère et qui geint
Et par le juste mis au rang des assassins
Je vous salue, Marie.

Par la mère apprenant que son fils est guéri
Par l'oiseau rappelant l'oiseau tombé du nid
Par l'herbe qui a soif et recueille l'ondée
Par le baiser perdu par l'amour redonné
Et par le mendiant retrouvant sa monnaie
Je vous salue, Marie.",La Prière
Georges Brassens,"Les copains affligés, les copines en pleurs
La boîte à dominos enfouie sous les fleurs
Tout le monde équipé de sa tenue de deuil
La farce était bien bonne et valait le coup d'œil

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
L'enterrement paraissait officiel. Bravo!

Le mort ne chantait pas : ""Ah ! c'qu'on s'emmerde ici !""
Il prenait son trépas à cœur, cette fois-ci
Et les bonshomm's chargés de la levée du corps
Ne chantaient pas non plus ""Saint-Eloi bande encor !""

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le macchabée semblait tout à fait mort. Bravo !

Ce n'étaient pas du tout des filles en tutu
Avec des fess's à claque et des chapeaux pointus
Les commères choisies pour les cordons du poêle
Et nul ne leur criait: ""A poil ! A poil ! A poil !""

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Les pleureuses sanglotaient pour de bon. Bravo !

Le curé n'avait pas un goupillon factice
Un de ces goupillons en forme de phallus
Et quand il y alla de ses de profondis
L'enfant de chœur répliqua pas morpionibus

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le curé venait pas de Camaret. Bravo !

On descendit la bière et je fus bien déçu
La blague maintenant frisait le mauvais goût
Car le mort se laissa jeter la terr' dessus
Sans lever le couvercle en s'écriant ""Coucou !""

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Le cercueil n'était pas à double fond. Bravo !

Quand tout fut consommé, je leur ai dit : ""Messieurs
Allons faire à présent la tournée des boxons !""
Mais ils m'ont regardé avec de pauvres yeux
Puis ils m'ont embrassé d'une étrange façon

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Leur compassion semblait venir du cœur. Bravo !

Quand je suis ressorti de ce champ de navets
L'ombre de l'ici-gît pas à pas me suivait
Une petite croix de trois fois rien du tout
Faisant, à elle seul', de l'ombre un peu partout

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
Les revenants s'en mêlaient à leur tour. Bravo !

J'ai compris ma méprise un petit peu plus tard
Quand, allumant ma pipe avec le faire-part
J'm'aperçus que mon nom, comm' celui d'un bourgeois
Occupait sur la liste une place de choix

Les quat'z'arts avaient fait les choses comme il faut
J'étais le plus proch' parent du défunt. Bravo !

Adieu ! les faux tibias, les crânes de carton
Plus de marche funèbre au son des mirlitons

Qu'on les avait déshonorée,
Déshonorés.

Comme un seul ont dit "" C'est fini,
Sans vergogne,
Fils indigne, je te renie,
Je te renie. ""

Le quatrième des parents,
Sans vergogne,
C'était le plus gros, le plus grand,
Le plus grand.

Quand il vint chercher son voleur
Sans vergogne,
On s'attendait à un malheur,
A un malheur.

Mais il n'a pas déclaré, non,
Sans vergogne,
Que l'on avait sali son nom,
Sali son nom.

Dans le silence on l'entendit,
Sans vergogne,
Qui lui disait : "" Bonjour, petit,
Bonjour petit. ""

On le vit, on le croirait pas,
Sans vergogne,
Lui tendre sa blague à tabac,
Blague à tabac.

Je ne sais pas s'il eut raison,
Sans vergogne,
D'agir d'une telle façon,
Telle façon.

Mais je sais qu'un enfant perdu,
Sans vergogne,
A de la corde de pendu,
De pendu,

A de la chance quand il a,
Sans vergogne,
Un père de ce tonneau-là,
Ce tonneau-là.

Et si les chrétiens du pays,
Sans vergogne,
Jugent que cet homme a failli,
Homme a failli.

Georges Brassens,"C'était tremblant, c'était troublant,
C'était vêtu d'un drap tout blanc,
Ça présentait tous les symptômes,
Tous les dehors de la vision,
Les faux airs de l'apparition,
En un mot, c'était un fantôme !

A sa manière d'avancer,
A sa façon de balancer
Les hanches quelque peu convexes,
Je compris que j'avais affaire
A quelqu'un du genr' que j'prefère :
A un fantôme du beau sexe.

"" Je suis un p'tit poucet perdu,
Me dit-ell', d'un' voix morfondue,
Un pauvre fantôme en déroute.
Plus de trace des feux follets,
Plus de trace des osselets
Dont j'avais jalonné ma route ! ""

"" Des poèt's sans inspiration
Auront pris -- quelle aberration ! --
Mes feux follets pour des étoiles.
De pauvres chiens de commissaire
Auront croqué -- quelle misère ! --
Mes oss'lets bien garnis de moelle. ""

"" A l'heure où le coq chantera,
J'aurai bonn' mine avec mon drap
Hein de faux plis et de coutures !
Et dans ce siècle profane où
Les gens ne croient plus guère à nous,
On va crier à l'imposture. ""

Moi, qu'un chat perdu fait pleurer,
Pensez si j'eus le cœur serré
Devant l'embarras du fantôme.
"" Venez, dis-je en prenant sa main,
Que je vous montre le chemin,
Que je vous reconduise at home ""

L'histoire finirait ici,
Mais la brise, et je l'en r'mercie,
Troussa le drap d'ma cavalière...
Dame, il manquait quelques oss'lets,
Mais le reste, loin d'être laid,
Etait d'un' grâce singulière.

Mon Cupidon, qui avait la
Flèche facile en ce temps-là,
Fit mouche et, le feu sur les tempes,
Je conviai, sournoisement,
La belle à venir un moment
Voir mes icônes, mes estampes...

"" Mon cher, dit-ell', vous êtes fou !
J'ai deux mille ans de plus que vous... ""

Bien enveloppé dans son drap,

Eh bien, messieurs, qu'on se le dis':
Ces belles dames de jadis
Sont de satanées polissonnes,

Georges Brassens,"La veuve et l'orphelin, quoi de plus émouvant ?
Un vieux copain d'école étant mort sans enfants,
Abandonnant au monde une épouse épatante,
J'allai rendre visite à la désespérée.
Et puis, ne sachant plus où finir ma soirée,
Je lui tins compagnie dans la chapelle ardente.

Pour endiguer ses pleurs, pour apaiser ses maux,
Je me mis à blaguer, à sortir des bons mots,
Tous les moyens sont bons au médecin de l'âme...
Bientôt, par la vertu de quelques facéties,
La veuve se tenait les côtes, Dieu merci !
Ainsi que des bossus, tous deux nous rigolâmes.

Ma pipe dépassait un peu de mon veston.
Aimable, elle m'encouragea : "" Bourrez-la donc,
Qu'aucun impératif moral ne vous arrête,
Si mon pauvre mari détestait le tabac,
Maintenant la fumée ne le dérange pas !
Mais où diantre ai-je mis mon porte-cigarettes ? ""

A minuit, d'une voix douce de séraphin,
Elle me demanda si je n'avais pas faim.
"" Ça le ferait-il revenir, ajouta-t-elle,
De pousser la piété jusqu'à l'inanition :
Que diriez-vous d'une frugale collation ? ""
Et nous fîmes un petit souper aux chandelles.

"" Regardez s'il est beau ! Dirait-on point qu'il dort.
Ce n'est certes pas lui qui me donnerait tort
De noyer mon chagrin dans un flot de champagne. ""
Quand nous eûmes vidé le deuxième magnum,
La veuve était émue, nom d'un petit bonhomm' !
Et son esprit se mit à battre la campagne...

"" Mon Dieu, ce que c'est tout de même que de nous ! ""
Soupira-t-elle, en s'asseyant sur mes genoux.
Et puis, ayant collé sa lèvre sur ma lèvre,
"" Me voilà rassurée, fit-elle, j'avais peur
Que, sous votre moustache en tablier d'sapeur,
Vous ne cachiez coquettement un bec-de-lièvre... ""

Un tablier d'sapeur, ma moustache, pensez !
Cette comparaison méritait la fessée.
Retroussant l'insolente avec nulle tendresse,
Conscient d'accomplir, somme toute, un devoir,
Mais en fermant les yeux pour ne pas trop en voir,
Paf ! j'abattis sur elle une main vengeresse !

"" Aïe ! vous m'avez fêlé le postérieur en deux ! ""
Se plaignit-elle, et je baissai le front, piteux,
Craignant avoir frappé de façon trop brutale.
Mais j'appris, par la suite, et j'en fus bien content,
Que cet état de chos's durait depuis longtemps :
Menteuse ! la fêlure était congénitale.

Quand je levai la main pour la deuxième fois,
Le cœur n'y était plus, j'avais perdu la foi,
Surtout qu'elle s'était enquise, la bougresse :
"" Avez-vous remarqué que j'avais un beau cul ?
Et ma main vengeresse est retombée, vaincue!
Et le troisième coup ne fut qu'une caresse...",La Fessée
Georges Brassens,"Dans l'eau de la claire fontaine
Elle se baignait toute nue
Une saute de vent soudaine
Jeta ses habits dans les nues

En détresse, elle me fit signe
Pour la vêtir, d'aller chercher
Des monceaux de feuilles de vigne
Fleurs de lis ou fleurs d'oranger

Avec des pétales de roses
Un bout de corsage lui fis
La belle n'était pas bien grosse
Une seule rose a suffi

Avec le pampre de la vigne
Un bout de cotillon lui fis
Mais la belle était si petite
Qu'une seule feuille a suffi

Elle me tendit ses bras, ses lèvres
Comme pour me remercier
Je les pris avec tant de fièvre
Qu'ell' fut toute déshabillée

Que les femelles du canton
Contemplaient un puissant gorille

Que, rigoureusement ma mère
M'a défendu de nommer ici

Dit c'est aujourd'hui que j'le perds 
Il parlait de son pucelage
Vous aviez deviné, j'espère
Gare au gorille

Criait, éperdu nom de nom 
C'est assommant car le gorille
N'a jamais connu de guenon 
Dès que la féminine engeance
Sut que le singe était puceau
Au lieu de profiter de la chance
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux 
Gare au gorille

Celles là même qui, naguère
Le couvaient d'un il décidé
Fuirent, prouvant qu'elles n'avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées
D'autant plus vaine était leur crainte
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l'homme dans l'étreinte
Bien des femmes vous le diront 
Gare au gorille

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d'atteinte du singe en rut
Sauf une vielle décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut
Voyant que toutes se dérobent

Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vieille et du magistrat
Gare au gorille

""Bah ! Soupirait la centenaire
Qu'on puisse encore me désirer
Ce serait extraordinaire
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré
Le juge pensait, impassible
Qu'on me prenne pour une guenon,
C'est complètement impossible
La suite lui prouva que non 
Gare au gorille

Supposez que l'un de vous puisse être
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre
Lequel choisirait-il des deux 
Qu'une alternative pareille
Un de ces quatres jours, m'échoie
C'est, j'en suis convaincu, la vieille
Qui sera l'objet de mon choix 
Gare au gorille

Mais, par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l'amour vaut son prix
On sait qu'en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût, ni par l'esprit
Lors, au lieu d'opter pour la vieille
Comme l'aurait fait n'importe qui
Il saisit le juge à l'oreille
Et l'entraîna dans un maquis 
Gare au gorille

La suite serait délectable
Malheureusement, je ne peux
Pas la dire, et c'est regrettable
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu 
Car le juge, au moment suprême
Criait : ""maman !"", pleurait beaucoup
Comme l'homme auquel, le jour même
Il avait fait trancher le cou

Par la façon qu'elle le donne
Son pain ressemble à du gâteau
Et son eau à du vin comme deux gouttes d'eau

La Jeanne, la Jeanne
On la paie quand on peut des prix mirobolants
Un baiser sur son front ou sur ses cheveux blancs
Un semblant d'accord de guitare
L'adresse d'un chat échaudé
Ou d'un chien tout crotté comm' pourboire

La Jeanne, la Jeanne
Dans ses ros's et ses choux n'a pas trouvé d'enfant
Qu'on aime et qu'on défend contre les quatre vents
Et qu'on accroche à son corsage
Et qu'on arrose avec son lait
D'autres qu'elle en seraient tout's chagrines

Mais Jeanne, la Jeanne
Ne s'en soucie pas plus que de colin-tampon

Quand tous les enfants de la terre

Je fais semblant d'être un poisson, d'être un poisson.
Je me déguise en cachalot
Et je me couche au fond de l'eau, au fond de l'eau.

J'ai le bonheur, grâce à ce biais, grâce à ce biais,
De lui croquer un bout de pied, un bout de pied.
Jamais requin n'a, j'en réponds,
Jamais rien goûté d'aussi bon, rien d'aussi bon.

Ell' m'a puni de ce culot, de ce culot,
En me tenant le bec dans l'eau, le bec dans l'eau.
Et j'ai dû, pour l'apitoyer,
Faire mine de me noyer, de me noyer.

Convaincu' de m'avoir occis, m'avoir occis,
La voilà qui se radoucit, se radoucit,
Et qui m'embrasse et qui me mord
Pour me ressusciter des morts, citer des morts.

Si c'est le sort qu'il faut subir, qu'il faut subir,
A l'heure du dernier soupir, dernier soupir,
Si, des noyés, tel est le lot,
Je retourne me fiche à l'eau, me fiche à l'eau.

Chez ses parents, le lendemain, le lendemain,
J'ai couru demander sa main, d'mander sa main,

Georges Brassens,"Aux quatre coins de France, émanant je suppose
De maris rancuniers par la haine conduits
Le bruit court que j'atteins l'heure de l'andropause
Qu'il ne faut plus compter sur moi dans le déduit

O n'insultez jamais une verge qui tombe
Ce n'est pas leur principe, ils crient sur tous les tons
Que l'une de mes deux est déjà dans la tombe
Et que l'autre à son tour file un mauvais coton

Tous ces empanachés bêtement se figurent
Qu'un membr' de ma famille est à jamais perclus
Que le fameux cochon, le pourceau d'Epicure
Qui sommeillait en moi ne s'éveillera plus

Ils me croient interdit de séjour à Cythère
Et, par les nuits sans lune avec jubilation
Ils gravent sur mon mur en style lapidaire
""Ici loge un vieux bouc qui n'a plus d'érections""

Ils sont prématurés, tous ces cris de victoire
O vous qui me plantez la corne dans le dos
Sachez que vous avez vendu les génitoires
Révérence parler, de l'ours un peu trop tôt

Je n'ai pas pour autant besoin de mandragore
Et vos femmes, messieurs, qu' ces jours-ci j'ai reçues
Que pas plus, tard qu'hier je contentais encore
Si j' n'ai plus d'érections, s'en fussent aperçues

A l'hôpital Saint-Louis, l'autre jour, ma parole
Le carabin m'a dit,""On ne peut s'y tromper
En un mot comme en cent, monsieur, c'est la vérole""
Si j' n'ai plus d'érections, comment l'ai-je attrapée?

Mon plus proche voisin n'aim' que sa légitime
Laquelle, épous' modèle, n'a que moi pour amant
Or tous deux d' la vérole, ils sont tombés victimes
Si j' n'ai plus d'érections, expliquez-moi comment?

Mes copains, mon bassiste et tous ceux de la troupe
En souffrirent bientôt, nul n'en fut préservé
Or je fus le premier à l'avoir dans le groupe
Si j' n'ai plus d'érections, comment est-ce arrivé?

Minotaures méchants, croyez-vous donc qu'à braire
Que mon train de plaisir arrive au terminus
Vous me cassiez mes coups? Au contraire, au contraire
Je n'ai jamais autant sacrifié à Vénus

Tenant à s'assurer si ces bruits qu'on colporte
Ces potins alarmants sont ou sont pas fondés
Ces dames nuit et jour font la queue à ma porte
Poussées par le démon de la curiosité

Et jamais, non jamais, soit dit sans arrogance
Mon commerce charnel ne fut plus florissant
Et vous, pauvres de vous, par voie de conséquence
Vous ne fûtes jamais plus cocus qu'à présent

Certes, elle sonnera cette heure fatidique
Où perdant toutes mes facultés génétiques je serai sans émoi
Où le septième ciel, ma plus chère ballade
Ma plus douce grimpette et plus tendre escalade sera trop haut pour moi

Il n'y aura pas de pleurs dans les gentilhommières
Ni de grincements de fesses dans les chaumières
Faut pas que je me leurre
Peu de chances qu'on voie mes belles odalisques
Déposer en grand deuil au pied de l'obélisque quelques gerbes de fleurs

Tout au plus gentiment diront-elles,""Peuchère
Le vieux Priape est mort"", et, la cuisse légère le regard alangui
Elles s'en iront vous rouler dans la farine
De safran, tempérer leur fureur utérine avec n'importe qui

Brave vieux, me plaisait beaucoup,

Si ça n'entraîne pas une guerre civile
Quand un fâcheux me contrarie, c'est - soyons francs -
Un peu par sympathie, par courtoisie servile,
Un peu par vanité d'avoir l'air tolérant,
Un peu par crainte aussi que cette grosse bête
Prise à rebrousse-poil ne sorte de ses gonds
Pour mettre à coups de poing son credo dans ma tête.

La morale de ma petite ritournelle,
Il semble superflu de vous l'expliciter.
Elle coule de source, elle est incluse en elle :
Faut choisir entre deux éventualités.
En fait d'alternative, on fait pas plus facile.

Ceux qui ne l'aiment pas, de pauvres imbéciles.

Rien d'épargné que le chardon
Dieu, s'il existe, il exagère, il exagère

Et là-dessus, méchant, glouton

Sans laisser même un rogaton
Tout il croque, tout il digère
Au ciel de qui se moque-t-on?

Georges Brassens,"Voici ce qu'il advint jadis grosso modo
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
Dans les années quarante
Où je débarquais de mon Languedo,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

Passait un' bell' gretchen au carrefour du château,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
Callipyge à prétendre
Jouer les Vénus chez les Hottentots,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

En signe d'irrespect, je balance aussitôt,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
En geste de revanche,
Une patte croche au bas de son dos,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

La souris gris' se fâche et subito presto,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
La conne, la méchante,
Va d'mander ma tête à ses p'tits poteaux,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

Deux sbires sont venus avec leurs noirs manteaux,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
Se pointer dans mon antre
Et sûrement pas pour m' fair' de cadeaux,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

J'étais alors en train de suer sang et eau,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
De m'user les phalanges
Sur un chouette accord du père Django,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

Par un heureux hasard, ces enfants de salauds,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
Un sacré coup de chance,
Aimaient la guitare et les trémolos,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

Ils s'en sont retournés sans finir leur boulot,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
Fredonnant un mélange
De Lily Marlène et d'Heili Heilo,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

Une supposition : qu'ils aient comme Malraux,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
Qu'ils aient comme ce branque
Compté la musique pour moins que zéro,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot,

M'auraient collé au mur avec ou sans bandeau,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
On lirait, quell' navrance !
Mon blase inconnu dans un ex-voto,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot.

Au théâtre, ce soir, ici sur ces tréteaux,
Entre la rue Didot et la rue de Vanves,
Poussant une autr' goualante,
Y aurait à ma place un autre cabot,
Entre la rue de Vanv's et la rue Didot. {2x}",Entre la Rue Didot et la Rue de Vanves

Si, déçu par une blonde,
Pensant faire un trou dans l'onde,

Qu'à te mouiller,

De peur qu'il ne te ressorte,
A l'écart de son bouchon.

Quand un goujon le taquine,
Qu'un gardon d'humeur coquine

Un petit poisson d'avril.

Laissant la rivière toute
Vide, désempoissonnée.

Repliant leurs épuisettes,

Quand j' pense à Felicie
Je bande aussi
quand j' pense à Léonor
Mon dieu je bande encore
Mais quand j' pense à Lulu
Là je ne bande plus
La bandaison papa
Ça n' se commande pas.

C'est cette mâle ritournelle
Cette antienne virile
Qui retentit dans la guérite
De la vaillante sentinelle.

Afin de tromper son cafard
De voir la vie moins terne
Tout en veillant sur sa lanterne
Chante ainsi le gardien de phare

Après la prière du soir
Comme il est un peu triste
Chante ainsi le séminariste
A genoux sur son reposoire.

A l'Etoile où j'était venu
Pour ranimer la flamme
J'entendis émus jusqu'au larmes
La voix du soldat inconnu.

Et je vais mettre un point final
A ce chant salutaire
En suggérant au solitaire
D'en faire un hymme national.",Fernande
Georges Brassens,"Ainsi, mon cher, tu t'en reviens
Du pays dont je me souviens
Comme d'un rêve
De ces beaux lieux où l'oranger
Naquit pour nous dédommager
Du péché d'Eve

Tu l'as vu, ce fantôme altier
Qui jadis eut le monde entier
Sous son empire
César dans sa pourpre est tombé 
Dans un petit manteau d'abbé
Sa veuve expire

Tu t'es bercé sur ce flot pur
Où Naples enchâsse dans l'azur
Sa mosaïque
Oreiller des lazzaroni
Où sont nés le macaroni
Et la musique

Qu'il soit rusé, simple ou moqueur
N'est-ce pas qu'il nous laisse au cur
Un charme étrange
Ce peuple ami de la gaieté
Qui donnerait gloire et beauté
Pour une orange 

Ischia ! c'est là qu'on a des yeux
C'est là qu'un corsage amoureux
Serre la hanche
Sur un bas rouge bien tiré
Brille, sous le jupon doré
La mule blanche

Pauvre Ischia ! bien des gens n'ont vu
Tes jeunes filles que pied nu
Dans la poussière
On les endimanche à prix d'or 
Mais ton pur soleil brille encor
Sur leur misère

Quoi qu'il en soit, il est certain
Que l'on ne parle pas latin
Dans les Abruzzes
Et que jamais un postillon
N'y sera l'enfant d'Apollon
Ni des neuf Muses

Toits superbes ! froids monuments 
Linceul d'or sur des ossements 
Ci-gît Venise
Là mon pauvre cur est resté
S'il doit m'en être rapporté
Dieu le conduise 

Mais de quoi vais-je ici parler 
Que ferait l'homme désolé
Quand toi, cher frère
Ces lieux où j'ai failli mourir
Tu t'en viens de les parcourir
Pour te distraire

Frère, ne t'en va plus si loin
D'un peu d'aide j'ai grand besoin
Quoi qu'il m'advienne
Je ne sais où va mon chemin
Mais je marche mieux quand ta main
Serre la mienne",A Mon Frere Revenant d' Italie
Georges Brassens,"Je veux dédier ce poème
A toutes les femmes qu'on aime
Pendant quelques instants secrets
A celles qu'on connait à peine
Qu'un destin différent entraîne
Et qu'on ne retrouve jamais

A celle qu'on voit apparaître
Une seconde à sa fenêtre
Et qui, preste, s'évanouit
Mais dont la svelte silhouette
Est si gracieuse et fluette
Qu'on en demeure épanoui

A la compagne de voyage
Dont les yeux, charmant paysage
Font paraître court le chemin
Qu'on est seul, peut-être, à comprendre
Et qu'on laisse pourtant descendre
Sans avoir effleuré sa main

A la fine et souple valseuse
Qui vous sembla triste et nerveuse
Par une nuit de carnaval
Qui voulu rester inconnue
Et qui n'est jamais revenue
Tournoyer dans un autre bal

A celles qui sont déjà prises
Et qui, vivant des heures grises
Près d'un être trop différent
Vous ont, inutile folie,
Laissé voir la mélancolie
D'un avenir désespérant

Chères images aperçues
Espérances d'un jour déçues
Vous serez dans l'oubli demain
Pour peu que le bonheur survienne
Il est rare qu'on se souvienne
Des épisodes du chemin

Mais si l'on a manqué sa vie
On songe avec un peu d'envie
A tous ces bonheurs entrevus
Aux baisers qu'on n'osa pas prendre
Aux cœurs qui doivent vous attendre
Aux yeux qu'on n'a jamais revus

Alors, aux soirs de lassitude
Tout en peuplant sa solitude
Des fantômes du souvenir
On pleure les lêvres absentes
De toutes ces belles passantes
Que l'on n'a pas su retenir",Les Passantes
Georges Brassens,"Jadis, au lieu du jardin que voici,
C’était la zone et tout ce qui s'ensuit,
Des masures des taudis insolites,
Des ruines pas romaines pour un sou.
Quant à la faune habitant la dessous
C’était la fine fleur c’était l'élite.

La fine fleur, l'élite du pavé.
Des besogneux des gueux des réprouvés,
Des mendiants rivalisant de tares,
Des chevaux de retour des propres à rien,
Ainsi qu'un croque-note, un musicien,
Une épave accrochée à sa guitare.

Adoptée par ce beau monde attendri,
Une petite fée avait fleuri
Au milieu de toute cette bassesse.
Comme on l'avait trouvée près du ruisseau,
Abandonnée en un somptueux berceau,
A tout hasard on l'appelait ""princesse"".

Or, un soir, Dieu du ciel, protégez nous!
La voila qui monte sur les genoux
Du croque-note et doucement soupire,
En rougissant quand même un petit peu
""C'est toi que j'aime et si tu veux tu peux
M'embrasser sur la bouche et même pire""

""Tout beau, princesse arrête un peu ton tir,
J'ai pas tellement l'étoffe du satyre,
Tu a treize ans,j'en ai trente qui sonnent,
Grosse différence et je ne suis pas chaud
Pour tâter d'la paille humide du cachot
Mais croque-not',j'dirais rien à personne""

N'insiste pas fit-il d'un ton railleur,
D'abord tu n'es pas mon genre et d'ailleurs
Mon cœur est déjà pris par une grande""
Alors princesse est partie en courant,
Alors princesse est partie en pleurant,
Chagrine qu'on ait boudé son offrande.

Y a pas eu détournement de mineure,
Le croque-note au matin, de bonne heure,
A l'anglaise a filé dans la charrette
Des chiffonniers en grattant sa guitare.
Passant par là quelques vingt ans plus tard,
Il a le sentiment qu'il le regrette.",La Princesse et le Croque Notes
Georges Brassens,"Les dragons de vertu n'en prennent pas ombrage,
Si j'avais eu l'honneur de commander aù bord,
A bord du Titanic quand il a fait naufrage,
J'aurais crié:""Les femm's adultères d'abord!""

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière ...

Car, pour combler les vœux, calmer la fievre ardente
Du pauvre solitaire et qui n'est pas de bois,
Nulle n'est comparable à l'epouse inconstante.
Femmes de chefs de gar', c'est vous la fleur des bois.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Quant à vous, messeigneurs, aimez à votre guise,
En ce qui me concerne, ayant un jour compris
Qu'une femme adultère est plus qu'une autre exquise,
Je cherche mon bonheur à l'ombre des maris.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

A l'ombre des maris mais, cela va sans dire,
Pas n'importe lesquels, je les tri', les choisis.
Si madame Dupont, d'aventure, m'attire,
Il faut que, par surcroit, Dupont me plaise aussi!

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Il convient que le bougre ait une bonne poire
Sinon, me ravisant, je détale à grands pas,
Car je suis difficile et me refuse à boire
Dans le verr; d'un monsieur qui ne me revient pas.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Ils sont loins mes débuts ou, manquant de pratique,
Sur des femmes de flics je mis mon dévolu.
Je n'étais pas encore ouvert à l'esthétique.
Cette faute de gout je ne la commets plus.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Oui, je suis tatillon, pointilleux, mais j'estime
Que le mari doit être un gentleman complet,
Car on finit tous deux par devenir intimes
A force, à force de se passer le relais

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Mais si l'on tombe, hélas! sur des maris infames,
Certains sont si courtois, si bons si chaleureux,
Que, même apres avoir cessé d'aimer leur femme,
On fait encore semblant uniquement pour eux.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

C'est mon cas ces temps-ci, je suis triste, malade,
Quand je dois faire honneur à certaine pecore.
Mais, son mari et moi, c'est Oreste et Pylade,
Et, pour garder l'ami, je la cajole encore.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Non contente de me dé plaire, elle me trompe,
Et les jours ou, furieux, voulant tout mettre à bas
Je cri:""La coupe est pleine, il est temps que je rompe!""
Le mari me suppli':""Non ne me quittez pas!""

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Et je reste, et, tous deux, ensemble on se flagorne.
Moi, je lui dis:""C'est vous mon cocu préféré.""
Il me réplique alors:""Entre toutes mes cornes,
Celles que je vous dois, mon cher, me sont sacrées.""

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Et je reste et, parfois, lorsque cette pimbeche
S'attarde en compagni' de son nouvel amant,
Que la nurse est sorti', le mari à la peche,
C'est moi, pauvre de moi! qui garde les enfants.

Georges Brassens,"Un roi d'Espagne, ou bien de France,
Avait un cor, un cor au pied;
C'etait au pied gauche, je pense;
Il boitait aù faire pitie.

Les courtisans, espace adroite,
S'appliquerent aù limiter,
Et qui de gauche, qui de droite,
Il apprirent tous aù boiter.

On vit bientot le bénéfice
Que cette mode rapportait;
Et de l'antichambre aù l'office,
Tout le monde boitait,boitait.

Un jour, un seigneur de province,
Oubliant son nouveau métier,
Vint aù passer devant le prince,
Ferme et droit comme un peuplier.

Tout le monde se mit aù rire,
Excepté le roi qui, tout bas,
Murmura:""Monsieur,qu'est-ce aù dire ?
Je crois que vous ne boitez pas.""

""Sire, quelle erreur est la votre!
Je suis crible de cors; voyez:
Si je marche plus droit qu'un autre,
C'est que je boite des deux pieds.""",Le Roi Boiteux
Georges Brassens,"Si vous y tenez tant parlez-moi des affaires publiques
Encore que ce sujet me rende un peu mélancolique
Parlez-m'en toujours je n'vous en tiendrai pas rigueur
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Fi! des chantres bêlant qui taquine la muse érotique
Des poètes galants qui lèchent le cul d'Aphrodite
Des auteurs courtois qui vont en se frappant le cœur
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Naguère mes idées reposaient sur la non-violence
Mon agressivité je l'avait réduite au silence
Mais tout tourne court ma compagne était une gueuse
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Ancienne enfant trouvée n'ayant connu père ni mère
Coiffée d'un chap'ron rouge ell' s'en fut ironie amère
Porter soi-disant une galette à son aïeule
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Je l'attendis un soir je l'attendis jusqu'à l'aurore
Je l'attendis un an pour peu je l'attendrais encore
Un loup de rencontre aura séduite cette fugueuse
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Cupidon ce salaud geste chez lui qui n'est pas rare
Avais trempé sa flèche un petit peu dans le curare
Le philtre magique avait tout du bouillon d'onze heures
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Ainsi qu'il est fréquent sous la blancheur de ses pétales
La marguerite cachait une tarentule, un crotale
Une vraie vipère à la fois lubrique et visqueuse
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Que le septième ciel sur ma pauvre tête retombe
Lorsque le désespoir m'aura mis au bord de la tombe
Cet ultime discours s'exhalera de mon linceul
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois",Sauf le Respect Que Je Vous Dois
Georges Brassens,"Prince des monte-en-l'air et de la cambriole
Toi qui eus le bon goût de choisir ma maison
Cependant que je colportais mes gaudrioles
En ton honneur j'ai composé cette chanson

Sache que j'apprécie à sa valeur le geste
Qui te fit bien fermer la porte en repartant
De peur que des rôdeurs n'emportassent le reste
Des voleurs comme il faut c'est rare de ce temps

Tu ne m'as dérobé que le stricte nécessaire
Délaissant dédaigneux l'exécrable portrait
Que l'on m'avait offert à mon anniversaire
Quel bon critique d'art mon salaud tu ferais

Autre signe indiquant toute absence de tare
Respectueux du brave travailleur tu n'as
Pas cru décent de me priver de ma guitare
Solidarité sainte de l'artisanat

Pour toutes ces raisons vois-tu, je te pardonne
Sans arrière-pensée après mûr examen
Ce que tu m'as volé, mon vieux, je te le donne
Ça pouvait pas tomber en de meilleures mains

D'ailleurs moi qui te parle, avec mes chansonnettes
Si je n'avais pas dû rencontrer le succès
J'aurais tout comme toi, pu virer malhonnête
Je serais devenu ton complice, qui sait

En vendant ton butin, prends garde au marchandage
Ne vas pas tout lâcher en solde au receleurs
Tiens leur la dragée haute en évoquant l'adage
Qui dit que ces gens-là sont pis que les voleurs

Fort de ce que je n'ai pas sonné les gendarmes
Ne te crois pas du tout tenu de revenir
Ta moindre récidive abolirait le charme
Laisse-moi je t'en prie, sur un bon souvenir

Monte-en-l'air, mon ami, que mon bien te profite
Que Mercure te préserve de la prison
Et pas trop de remords, d'ailleurs nous sommes quittes
Apres tout ne te dois-je pas une chanson

Post-Scriptum, si le vol est l'art que tu préfères
Ta seule vocation, ton unique talent
Prends donc pignon sur rue, mets-toi dans les affaires
Et tu auras les flics même comme chalands",Stances À un Cambrioleur
Georges Brassens,"La Camarde qui ne m'a jamais pardonné
D´avoir semé des fleurs dans les trous de son nez
Me poursuit d'un zèle imbécile
Alors cerné de près par les enterrements
J´ai cru bon de remettre à jour mon testament
De me payer un codicille

Trempe dans l'encre bleue du Golfe du Lion
Trempe, trempe ta plume, à mon vieux tabellion
Et de ta plus belle écriture
Note ce qu'il faudra qu'il advint de mon corps
Lorsque mon âme et lui ne seront plus d'accord
Que sur un seul point, la rupture

Quand mon âme aura pris son vol à l'horizon
Vers celle de Gavroche et de Mimi Pinson
Celles des titis, des grisettes
Que vers le sol natal mon corps soit ramené
Dans un sleeping du Paris-Méditerranée
Terminus en gare de Sète

Mon caveau de famille, hélas! n'est pas tout neuf
Vulgairement parlant, il est plein comme un œuf
Et d'ici que quelqu'un n'en sorte
Il risque de se faire tard et je ne peux
Dire à ces braves gens, poussez-vous donc un peu
Place aux jeunes en quelque sorte

Juste au bord de la mer à deux pas des flots bleus
Creusez si c'est possible un petit trou moelleux
Une bonne petite niche
Auprès de mes amis d'enfance, les dauphins
Le long de cette grève où le sable est si fin
Sur la plage de la corniche

C'est une plage où même à ses moments furieux
Neptune ne se prend jamais trop au sérieux
Où quand un bateau fait naufrage
Le capitaine crie ""Je suis le maître à bord!
Sauve qui peut, le vin et le pastis d'abord
Chacun sa bonbonne et courage""

Oh, et c'est là que jadis à quinze ans révolus
A l'âge où s'amuser tout seul ne suffit plus
Je connu la prime amourette
Auprès d'une sirène, une femme-poisson
J'ai reçu de l'amour la première leçon
Avalait la première arête

Déférence gardée envers Paul Valéry
Moi l'humble troubadour sur lui je renchéris
Le bon maître me le pardonne
Et qu'au moins si ses vers valent mieux que les miens
Mon cimetière soit plus marin que le sien
N'en déplaise aux autochtones

Cette tombe en sandwich entre le ciel et l'eau
Ne donnera pas une ombre triste au tableau
Mais un charme indéfinissable
Les baigneuses s'en serviront de paravent
Pour changer de tenue et les petits enfants
Diront, chouette, un château de sable!

Est-ce trop demander, sur mon petit lopin
Planter, je vous en prie une espèce de pin
Pin parasol de préférence
Qui saura prémunir contre l´insolation
Les bons amis venus faire sur ma concession
D'affectueuses révérences

Tantôt venant d'Espagne, tantôt d'Italie
Tous chargés de parfums, de musiques jolies
Le Mistral, la Tramontane
Sur mon dernier sommeil verseront les échos
De villanelle, un jour, un jour de fandango
De tarentelle, de sardane

Et quand prenant ma butte en guise d'oreiller
Une ondine viendra gentiment sommeiller
Avec moins que rien de costume
J'en demande pardon par avance à Jésus
Si l'ombre de sa croix s'y couche un peu dessus
Pour un petit bonheur posthume

Pauvres rois pharaons, pauvre Napoléon
Pauvres grands disparus gisant au Panthéon
Pauvres cendres de conséquence
Vous envierez un peu l'éternel estivant
Qui fait du pédalo sur la vague en rêvant
Qui passe sa mort en vacances

Qui passe sa mort en vacances",Supplique Pour Être Enterré Á la Plage de Sète

Qu'on se pende ici, qu'on se pende ailleurs
S'il faut se pendre

De razzia, de déprédation,
Aucun but illicite.

On venait pas gober leurs œufs,

On avançait avec maintien
Et d'un pas qui hésite.
On braquait pas des revolvers,
On arrivait les bras ouverts,
On venait en visite.

Mais ils sont rentrés dans leurs trous,
Mais ils ont poussé les verrous
Dans un accord tacite.
Ils ont fermé les contrevents,
Caché les femmes, les enfants,
Refusé la visite.

On venait pas les sermonner,
Tenter de les endoctriner,
Pas leur prendre leur site.
On venait leur dire en passant,
Un petit bonjour innocent,
On venait en visite.

On venait pour se présenter,
On venait pour les fréquenter,
Pour qu'ils nous plébiscitent,
Dans l'espérance d'être admis
Et naturalisés amis,

Que rien ne nécessite.

Tous ces bourgs, ces hameaux, ces lieux-dits, ces cités
Avec leurs châteaux forts, leurs églises, leurs plages
Ils n'ont qu'un seul point faible et c'est être habités

Et c'est être habités par des gens qui regardent
Le reste avec mépris du haut de leurs remparts
La race des chauvins, des porteurs de cocardes
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part

Maudits soient ces enfants de leur mère patrie
Empalés une fois pour toutes sur leur clocher
Qui vous montrent leurs tours leurs musées leur mairie
Vous font voir du pays natal jusqu'à loucher

Qu'ils sortent de Paris ou de Rome ou de Sète
Ou du diable vauvert ou de Zanzibar
Ou même de Montcuq il s'en flattent mazette
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part

Le sable dans lequel douillettes leurs autruches
Enfouissent la tête on trouve pas plus fin
Quand à l'air qu'ils emploient pour gonfler leurs baudruches
Leurs bulles de savon c'est du souffle divin

Et petit à petit les voilà qui se montent
Le cou jusqu'à penser que le crottin fait par
Les chevaux même en bois rend jaloux tout le monde
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part

C'est pas un lieu commun celui de leur connaissance
Ils plaignent de tout coeur les malchanceux
Les petits maladroits qui n'eurent pas la présence
La présence d'esprit de voir le jour chez eux

Quand sonne le tocsin sur leur bonheur précaire
Contre les étrangers tous plus ou moins barbares
Ils sortent de leur trou pour mourir à la guerre
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part

Mon Dieu qu'il ferait bon sur la terre des hommes
Si on y rencontrait cette race incongrue
Cette race importune et qui partout foisonne
La race des gens du terroir des gens du cru

Que la vie serait belle en toutes circonstances
Si vous n'aviez tiré du néant tous ces jobards
Preuve peut-être bien de votre inexistence
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part
Les imbéciles heureux qui sont nés quelque part

Georges Brassens,"Par le petit garçon qui meurt près de sa mère
Tandis que des enfants s'amusent au parterre
Et par l'oiseau blessé qui ne sait pas comment
Son aile tout à coup s'ensanglante et descend
Par la soif et la faim et le délire ardent
Je vous salue, Marie

Par les gosses battus, par l'ivrogne qui rentre
Par l'âne qui reçoit des coups de pied au ventre
Et par l'humiliation de l'innocent châtié
Par la vierge vendue qu'on a déshabillée
Par le fils dont la mère a été insultée
Je vous salue, Marie

Par la vieille qui, trébuchant sous trop de poids
S'écrie: "" Mon Dieu ! "" par le malheureux dont les bras
Ne purent s'appuyer sur une amour humaine

Par le cheval tombé sous le chariot qu'il traîne

Par les quatre horizons qui crucifient le monde
Par tous ceux dont la chair se déchire ou succombe
Par ceux qui sont sans pieds, par ceux qui sont sans mains
Par le malade que l'on opère et qui geint
Et par le juste mis au rang des assassins
Je vous salue, Marie

Par la mère apprenant que son fils est guéri
Par l'oiseau rappelant l'oiseau tombé du nid
Par l'herbe qui a soif et recueille l'ondée
Par le baiser perdu par l'amour redonné
Et par le mendiant retrouvant sa monnaie

Georges Brassens,"Voir le nombril de la femme d'un flic
N'est certainement pas un spectacle
Qui, du point de vue de l'esthétique
Puisse vous élever au pinacle
Il y eut pourtant, dans le vieux Paris
Un honnête homme sans malice
Brûlant de contempler le nombril
De la femme d'un agent de police

""Je me fais vieux, gémissait-il
Et, durant le cours de ma vie
J'ai vu bon nombre de nombrils
De toutes les catégories
Nombrils de femmes de croque-morts, nombrils
De femmes de bougnats, de femmes de jocrisses
Mais je n'ai jamais vu celui
De la femme d'un agent de police""

""Mon père a vu, comme je vous vois
Des nombrils de femmes de gendarmes
Mon frère a goûté plus d'une fois
De ceux des femmes d'inspecteurs les charmes
Mon fils vit le nombril de la souris
D'un ministre de la Justice
Et moi, je n'ai même pas vu le nombril
De la femme d'un agent de police""

Ainsi gémissait en public
Cet honnête homme vénérable
Quand la légitime d'un flic
Tendant son nombril secourable
Lui dit ""Je m'en vais mettre fin
A votre pénible supplice
Vous faire voir le nombril enfin
De la femme d'un agent de police""

""Alléluia! fit le bon vieux
De mes tourments voici la trêve!
Grâces soient rendues au Bon Dieu
Je vais réaliser mon rêve !""
Il s'engagea, tout attendri
Sous les jupons de sa bienfaitrice
Braquer ses yeux sur le nombril
De la femme d'un agent de police

Mais, hélas! il était rompu
Par les effets de sa hantise
Et comme il atteignait le but
De cinquante ans de convoitise

Sur l'abdomen de sa complice
Il n'a jamais vu le nombril

Georges Brassens,"Comme elle n'aime pas beaucoup la solitude
Cependant que je pêche et que je m'ennoblis
Ma femme sacrifie à sa vieille habitude
De faire, à tout venant, les honneurs de mon lit

Eh ! oui, je suis cocu, j'ai du cerf sur la tête
On fait force de trous dans ma lune de miel
Ma bien-aimée ne m'invite plus à la fête
Quand ell' va faire un tour jusqu'au septième ciel

Au péril de mon cœur, la malheureuse écorne
Le pacte conjugal et me le déprécie
Que je ne sache plus où donner de la corne
Semble bien être le cadet de ses soucis

Les galants de tout poil viennent boire en mon verre
Je suis la providence des écornifleurs
On cueille dans mon dos la tendre primevère
Qui tenait le dessus de mon panier de fleurs

En revenant fourbu de la pêche à la ligne
Je les surprends tout nus dans leurs débordements
Conseillez-leur le port de la feuille de vigne
Ils s'y refuseront avec entêtement

Souiller mon lit nuptial, est-c' que ça les empêche
De garder les dehors de la civilité ?
Qu'on me demande au moins si j'ai fait bonne pêche
Qu'on daigne s'enquérir enfin de ma santé

De grâce, un minimum d'attentions délicates
Pour ce pauvre mari qu'on couvre de safran
Le cocu, d'ordinaire, on le choie, on le gâte
On est en fin de compte un peu de ses parents

A l'heure du repas, mes rivaux détestables
Ont encor ce toupet de lorgner ma portion
Ça leur ferait pas peur de s'asseoir à ma table
Cocu, tant qu'on voudra, mais pas amphitryon

Partager sa moitié, est-c' que cela comporte
Que l'on partage aussi la chère et la boisson ?
Je suis presque obligé de les mettre à la porte
Et bien content s'ils n'emportent pas mes poissons

Bien content qu'en partant ces mufles ne s'égarent
Pas à mettre le comble à leur ignominie
En sifflotant "" Il est cocu, le chef de gare""
Parc' que, le chef de gar', c'est mon meilleur ami",Le  Cocu [Mono]
Georges Brassens,"Parlez-moi de la pluie et non pas du beau temps
Le beau temps me dégoute et m'fait grincer les dents
Le bel azur me met en rage
Car le plus grand amour qui m'fut donné sur terr'
Je l'dois au mauvais temps, je l'dois à Jupiter
Il me tomba d'un ciel d'orage

Par un soir de novembre, à cheval sur les toits
Un vrai tonnerr' de Brest, avec des cris d'putois
Allumait ses feux d'artifice
Bondissant de sa couche en costume de nuit
Ma voisine affolée vint cogner à mon huis
En réclamant mes bons offices

"" Je suis seule et j'ai peur, ouvrez-moi, par pitié
Mon époux vient d'partir faire son dur métier
Pauvre malheureux mercenaire
Contraint d'coucher dehors quand il fait mauvais temps
Pour la bonne raison qu'il est représentant
D'un' maison de paratonnerres ""

En bénissant le nom de Benjamin Franklin
Je l'ai mise en lieu sûr entre mes bras câlins
Et puis l'amour a fait le reste

Que n'en as-tu planté sur ta propre maison
Erreur on ne peut plus funeste

Quand Jupiter alla se faire entendre ailleurs
La belle, ayant enfin conjuré sa frayeur
Et recouvré tout son courage
Rentra dans ses foyers fair' sécher son mari
En m'donnant rendez-vous les jours d'intempérie
Rendez-vous au prochain orage

A partir de ce jour j'n'ai plus baissé les yeux
J'ai consacré mon temps à contempler les cieux
A regarder passer les nues
A guetter les stratus, à lorgner les nimbus
A faire les yeux doux aux moindres cumulus
Mais elle n'est pas revenue

Son bonhomm' de mari avait tant fait d'affair's
Tant vendu ce soir-là de petits bouts de fer
Qu'il était dev'nu millionnaire
Et l'avait emmenée vers des cieux toujours bleus
Des pays imbécil's où jamais il ne pleut
Où l'on ne sait rien du tonnerre

Lui parler de la pluie, lui parler du gros temps

D'un' petit' fleur qui lui ressemble",L'Orage
Georges Brassens,"Moi, mes amours d'antan c'était de la grisette
Margot, la blanche caille, et Fanchon, la cousette
Pas la moindre noblesse, excusez-moi du peu,
C'étaient, me direz-vous, des grâces roturières,
Des nymphes de ruisseau, des Vénus de barrière
Mon prince, on a les dam's du temps j'ai dis, qu'on peut

Car le cœur à vingt ans se pose où l'œil se pose,
Le premier cotillon venu vous en impose,
La plus humble bergère est un morceau de roi.
Ça manquait de marquise, on connut la soubrette,
Faute de fleur de lys on eut la pâquerette,
Au printemps Cupidon fait flèche de tout bois

On rencontrait la belle aux Puces, le dimanche :
""Je te plais, tu me plais"" et c'était dans la manche,
Et les grands sentiments n'étaient pas de rigueur.
""Je te plais, tu me plais. Viens donc beau militaire""
Dans un train de banlieue on partait pour Cythère,
On n'était pas tenu même d'apporter son cœur

Mimi, de prime abord, payait guère de mine,
Chez son fourreur sans doute on ignorait l'hermine,
Son habit sortait point de l'atelier d'un dieu
Mais quand, par-dessus le moulin de la Galette,
Elle jetait pour vous sa parure simplette,
C'est Psyché tout entier' qui vous sautait aux yeux.

Au second rendez-vous y'avait parfois personne,
Elle avait fait faux bond, la petite amazone,
Mais l'on ne courait pas se pendre pour autant
La marguerite commence avec Suzette,
On finissait de l'effeuiller avec Lisette
Et l'amour y trouvait quand même son content.

C'étaient, me direz-vous, des grâces roturières,
Des nymphes de ruisseau, des Vénus de barrière,
Mais c'étaient mes amours, excusez-moi du peu,

On ne les r'verra plus
Et c'est bien attristant
Les belles pompes funèbres de nos vingt ans

Plutôt qu'd'avoir des obsèqu's manquant de fioritur's
J'aim'rais mieux, tout compte fait, m'passer de sépultur
J'aim'rais mieux mourir dans l'eau, dans le feu, n'importe où
Et même, à la grand' rigueur, ne pas mourir du tout
O, que renaisse le temps des morts bouffis d'orgueil
L'époque des m'as-tu-vu-dans-mon-joli-cercueil
Où, quitte à tout dépenser jusqu'au dernier écu
Les gens avaient à cœur d'mourir plus haut qu'leur cul
Les gens avaient à cœur de mourir plus haut que leur cul",Les Funérailles d'Antan

Ce pigeon est aimé
Trois jours par sa pigeonne
Ça lui suffit il sait
Que l'amour n'a qu'un temps

Ce dindon a toujours
Béni sa destinée
Et quand vient le moment
De mourir il faut voir

Cette jeune oie en pleurs
C'est la que je suis née
Je meurs presd de ma mère
Et je fais mon devoir

Elle a fait son devoir
C'est a dire que Onques
Elle n'eut de souhait
Impossible elle n'eut

Aucun rêve de lune
Aucun désir de jonque
L'emportant sans rameurs
Sur un fleuve inconnu

Et tous sont ainsi faits
Vivre la même vie
Toujours pour ces gens là
Cela n'est point hideux

Ce canard n'a qu'un bec
Et n'eut jamais envie
Ou de n'en plus avoir
Ou bien d'en avoir deux

Ils n'ont aucun besoin
De baiser sur les lèvres
Et loin des songes vains
Loin des soucis cuisants

Possèdent pour tout cœur
Un vicere sans fièvre
Un coucou régulier
Et garanti dix ans

Ô les gens bien heureux
Tout à coup dans l'espace
Si haut qu'ils semblent aller
Lentement en grand vol

En forme de triangle
Arrivent planent, et passent
Où vont ils? qui sont-ils ?
Comme ils sont loins du sol

Regardez les passer, eux
Ce sont les sauvages
Ils vont où leur desir
Le veut par dessus monts

Et bois, et mers, et vents
Et loin des esclavages
L'air qu'ils boivent
Ferait éclater vos poumons

Regardez les avant
D'atteindre sa chimère
Plus d'un l'aile rompue
Et du sang plein les yeux

Mourra. Ces pauvres gens
Ont aussi femme et mère
Et savent les aimer
Aussi bien que vous, mieux

Pour choyer cette femme
Et nourrir cette mère
Ils pouvaient devenir
Volailles comme vous

Mais ils sont avant tout
Des fils de la chimère
Des asoiffés d'azur
Des poètes des fous

Regardez les vieux coqs

Georges Brassens,"Je veux dédier ce poème
A toutes les femmes qu'on aime
Pendant quelques instants secrets
A celles qu'on connait à peine
Qu'un destin différent entraîne
Et qu'on ne retrouve jamais

A celle qu'on voit apparaître
Une seconde à sa fenêtre
Et qui, preste, s'évanouit
Mais dont la svelte silhouette
Est si gracieuse et fluette
Qu'on en demeure épanoui

A la compagne de voyage
Dont les yeux, charmant paysage
Font paraître court le chemin
Qu'on est seul, peut-être, à comprendre
Et qu'on laisse pourtant descendre
Sans avoir effleuré sa main

A la fine et souple valseuse
Qui vous sembla triste et nerveuse
Par une nuit de carnaval
Qui voulu rester inconnue
Et qui n'est jamais revenue
Tournoyer dans un autre bal

A celles qui sont déjà prises
Et qui, vivant des heures grises
Près d'un être trop différent
Vous ont, inutile folie,
Laissé voir la mélancolie
D'un avenir désespérant

Chères images aperçues
Espérances d'un jour déçues
Vous serez dans l'oubli demain
Pour peu que le bonheur survienne
Il est rare qu'on se souvienne
Des épisodes du chemin

Mais si l'on a manqué sa vie
On songe avec un peu d'envie
A tous ces bonheurs entrevus
Aux baisers qu'on n'osa pas prendre
Aux cœurs qui doivent vous attendre
Aux yeux qu'on n'a jamais revus

Alors, aux soirs de lassitude
Tout en peuplant sa solitude
Des fantômes du souvenir
On pleure les lêvres absentes
De toutes ces belles passantes
Que l'on n'a pas su retenir",Les Passantes
Georges Brassens,"Les invalid's chez nous, l'revers de leur médaille
C'est pas d'être hors d'état de suivr' les fill's, cré nom de nom

Ce que, par-dessus tout, nos aveugles déplorent
C'est pas d'être hors d'état d'se rincer l'œil, cré nom de nom
Mais de ne plus pouvoir lorgner le drapeau tricolore

Et les sourds de chez nous, s'ils sont mélancoliques

Et les muets d'chez nous, c'qui les met mal à l'aise
C'est pas d'être hors d'état d'conter fleurette, cré nom de nom
Mais de ne plus pouvoir reprendre en chœur la Marseillaise
Les chansons martiales sont les seules que nous entonnons

Ce qui de nos manchots aigrit le caractère
C'est pas d'être hors d'état d'pincer les fess's, cré nom de nom
Mais de ne plus pouvoir faire le salut militaire
jamais un bras d'honneur ne sera notre geste, non

Les estropiés d'chez nous, ce qui les rend patraques
C'est pas d'être hors d'état d'courir la gueus', cré nom de nom
Mais de ne plus pouvoir participer à une attaque
On rêve de Rosalie, la baïonnette, pas de Ninon

C'qui manque aux amputés de leurs bijoux d'famille
C'est pas d'être hors d'état d'aimer leur femm', cré nom de nom
Mais de ne plus pouvoir sabrer les belles ennemies
La colomb' de la paix, on l'apprête aux petits oignons

Quant à nos trépassés, s'ils ont tous l'âme en peine
C'est pas d'être hors d'état d'mourir d'amour, cré nom de nom

Georges Brassens,"Je vivais à l'écart de la place publique,
Serein, contemplatif, ténébreux, bucolique
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloire,
Sur mon brin de laurier je dormais comme un loir.
Les gens de bon conseil ont su me faire comprendre
Qu'à l'homme de la rue j'avais des comptes à rendre
Et que, sous peine de choir dans un oubli complet,
Je devais mettre au grand jour tous mes petits secrets.

Trompettes
De la Renommée,
Vous êtes
Bien mal embouchées!

Manquant à la pudeur la plus élémentaire,
Dois-je, pour les besoins d' la cause publicitaire,
Divulguer avec qui, et dans quelle position
Je plonge dans le stupre et la fornication?
Si je publie des noms, combien de Pénélopes
Passeront illico pour de fieffées salopes,
Combien de bons amis me regarderont de travers,
Combien je recevrai de coups de revolver!

A toute exhibition, ma nature est rétive,
Souffrant d'un' modestie quasiment maladive,
Je ne fais voir mes organes procréateurs
A personne, excepté mes femmes et mes docteurs.
Dois-je, pour défrayer la chronique des scandales,
Battre l' tambour avec mes parties génitales,
Dois-je les arborer plus ostensiblement,
Comme un enfant de chœur porte un saint sacrement?

Une femme du monde, et qui souvent me laisse
Faire mes quat' voluptés dans ses quartiers d' noblesse,
M'a sournoisement passé, sur son divan de soie,
Des parasites du plus bas étage qui soit
Sous prétexte de bruit, sous couleur de réclame,
Ai-j' le droit de ternir l'honneur de cette dame
En criant sur les toits, et sur l'air des lampions
""Madame la marquis' m'a foutu des morpions!""?

Le ciel en soit loué, je vis en bonne entente
Avec le Père Duval, la calotte chantante,
Lui, le catéchumène, et moi, l'énergumène,
Il me laisse dire merde, je lui laisse dire amen,
En accord avec lui, dois-je écrire dans la presse
Qu'un soir je l'ai surpris aux genoux d' ma maîtresse,
Chantant la mélopée d'une voix qui susurre,
Tandis qu'elle lui cherchait des poux dans la tonsure?

Avec qui, ventrebleu! faut-il que je couche
Pour faire parler un peu la déesse aux cent bouches?
Faut-il qu'un' femme célèbre, une étoile, une star,
Vienne prendre entre mes bras la place de ma guitare?
Pour exciter le peuple et les folliculaires,
Qui est-ce qui veut me prêter sa croupe populaire,
Qui est-ce qui veut m' laisser faire, in naturalibus,
Un petit peu d'alpinisme sur son mont de Vénus?

Sonneraient-elles plus fort, ces divines trompettes,
Si, comme tout un chacun, j'étais un peu tapette,
Si je me déhanchais comme une demoiselle
Et prenais tout à coup des allumes de gazelle?
Mais je ne sache pas que ça profite à ces drôles
De jouer le jeu d' l'amour en inversant les rôles,
Que ça confère à ma gloire un' once de plus-valu',
Le crime pédérastique, aujourd'hui, ne paie plus.

Après ce tour d'horizon des mille et un' recettes
Qui vous valent à coup sûr les honneurs des gazettes,
J'aime mieux m'en tenir à ma première façon
Et me gratter le ventre en chantant des chansons.
Si le public en veut, je les sors dare-dare,
S'il n'en veut pas je les remets dans ma guitare.
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloire,
Sur mon brin de laurier je m'endors comme un loir.",Les Trompettes de La Renommée
Georges Brassens,"Mariage d'amour, mariage d'argent
J'ai vu se marier toutes sortes de gens
Des gens de basse source et des grands de la terre
Des prétendus coiffeurs, des soi-disant notaires

Quand même je vivrai jusqu'à la fin des temps
Je garderais toujours le souvenir content
Du jour de pauvre noce où mon père et ma mère
S'allèrent épouser devant Monsieur le Maire

C'est dans un char à bœufs, s'il faut parler bien franc
Tiré par les amis, poussé par les parents
Que les vieux amoureux firent leurs épousailles
Après long temps d'amour, long temps de fiançailles
Cortège nuptial hors de l'ordre courant
La foule nous couvait d'un œil protubérant
Nous étions contemplés par le monde futile
Qui n'avait jamais vu de noces de ce style

Voici le vent qui souffle emportant, crève-cœur
Le chapeau de mon père et les enfants de chœur
Voilà la pluie qui tombe en pesant bien ses gouttes
Comme pour empêcher la noc', coûte que coûte

Je n'oublierai jamais la mariée en pleurs
Berçant comme un' poupée son gros bouquet de fleurs
Moi, pour la consoler, moi, de toute ma morgue
Sur mon harmonica jouant les grandes orgues

Tous les garçons d'honneur, montrant le poing aux nues
Criaient: "" Par Jupiter, la noce continue! ""

Des braves enfants de naguère
Qui sur la plage ont bataillé
Pour sauver un château de sable
Et ses remparts infranchissables
Qu'une vague allait balayer

J'en étais : l'arme à la bretelle
Retranchés dans la citadelle
De pied ferme nous attendions
Une cohorte sarrasine
Partie de la côte voisine
A l'assaut de notre bastion

A cent pas de là sur la dune
En attendant que la fortune
Des armes sourie aux vainqueurs
Languissant d'être courtisées
Nos promises, nos fiancées
Préparaient doucement leur cur

Tout à coup l'Armada sauvage
Déferla sur notre rivage
Avec ses lances, ses pavois
Pour commettre force rapines
Et même enlever nos Sabines
Plus belles que les leurs, ma foi

La mêlée fut digne d'Homère
Et la défaite bien amère
A l'ennemi pourtant nombreux
Qu'on battit à plate couture
Qui partit en déconfitur
En déroute, en sauve-qui-peut

Oui, cette horde de barbares
Que notre fureur désempare
Fit retraite avec ses vaisseaux
En n'emportant pour tous trophées
Moins que rien, deux balles crevées
Trois raquettes, quatre cerceaux

Après la victoire fameuse
En chantant l'air de ""Sambre et Meuse""
Et de la ""Marseillaise"", ô gué

Que le joli sexe dispense
Aux petits héros fatigués

Tandis que tout bas à l'oreille
De nos Fanny, de nos Mireille
On racontait notre saga
Qu'au doigt on leur passait la bague
Surgit une espèce de vague
Que personne ne remarqua

Au demeurant ce n'était qu'une
Vague sans amplitude aucune
Une vaguelette égarée
Mais en atteignant au rivage
Elle causa plus de ravages
De dégâts qu'un raz-de-marée

Expéditive, la traîtresse
Investit notre forteresse
La renversant, la détruisant
Adieu donjon, tours et courtines
Que quatre gouttes anodines
Avaient effacés en passant

A quelque temps de là nous sommes
Allés mener parmi les hommes
D'autres barouds plus décevants
Allés mener d'autres campagnes
Où les châteaux sont plus d'Espagne
Et de sable qu'auparavant

Quand je vois lutter sur la plage
Des soldats à la fleur de l'âge
Je ne les décourage pas
Quoique je sache, ayant naguère
Livré moi-même cette guerre
L'issue fatale du combat

Je sais que malgré leur défense

A la place du sien

Georges Brassens,"Calme, confortable, officiel,
En un mot résidentiel,
Tel était le cimetière où
Cet imbécile avait son trou.

Comme il ne reconnaissait pas
Le bien-fondé de son trépas,
L'a voulu faire, aberration !
Sa petite résurrection.

Les vieux morts, les vieux ""ici-gît"",
Les braves sépulcres blanchis,
Insistèrent pour qu'il revînt
Sur sa décision mais en vain.

L'ayant astiquée, il remit
Sur pied sa vieille anatomie,
Et tout pimpant, tout satisfait,
Prit la clef du champ de navets.

Chez lui s'en étant revenu,
Son chien ne l'a pas reconnu
Et lui croque en deux coups de dents
Un des os les plus importants.

En guise de consolation,
Pensa faire une libation,
Boire un coup de vin généreux,
Mais tous ses tonneaux sonnaient creux.

Quand dans l'alcôve il est entré
Embrasser sa veuve éplorée,
Il jugea d'un simple coup d'œil
Qu'elle ne portait plus son deuil.

Il la trouve se réchauffant
Avec un salaud de vivant,
Alors chancelant dans sa foi
Mourut une seconde fois.

La commère au potron-minet
Ramassa les os qui traînaient
Et pour une bouchée de pain
Les vendit à des carabins.

Et, depuis lors, ce macchabée,
Dans l'amphithéâtre tombé,
Malheureux, poussiéreux, transi,
Chante : ""Ah ! ce qu'on s'emmerde ici"" !",Le Revenant

Sur un air de violon
Qui venait du bout du Japon

Pris un bain de pieds
Et cherché des rimes

Comme il faisait bon
Sous mon édredon

Sur les dents du piano
Je comptais les sauts
Que faisait la puce 
Elle montait bien plus haut
Que ma nuit à San Francisco

Il vaut mieux s'amuser

Sur l'eau naviguait

Etait un miroir

Tous des assassins
Des tueurs de grives

Et un train arrive

Déliait les langues

Profitait de son point de vue

Attachaient leurs sangles

Lorsque j’ai fait sa connaissance un soir d’été au casino
L’enlaçant le temps d’une danse je la remarquai aussitôt
Si j’admirais sa silhouette son sourire et son nez mutin
Je crois que je perdis la tête pour ce détail presque enfantin

Refrain

Une boucle blonde qui volait au vent sur sa frimousse ronde
Au teint de seize ans
Une boucle blonde aux reflets cendrés 
Mutine et vagabond comme l’aventure 
Un soir d’été et le vent,
Qui faisait chanter le rivage
Et le vent, semblait  nous dire profitons en 
Une boucle blonde qui volait au vent
M’entraîna dans la ronde folle d’un roman

Depuis que je suis bien loin d’elle
Comme un souvenir lancinant
Telle une étrange ritournelle
Que semble m’apporter le vent
Je revois son léger corsa age
Ses yeux rieurs, son corps troublant
Mais un détail seul se dégage
Toujours aussi simple et charmant

Un beau soir dans la rue,
Quand vous êtes venue
A Honolulu,
Et nous avons dansé
La nuit sous les palmiers,
Qu'il faisait bon l'été

Là, je vous ai donné
Notre premier baiser,
Mais jamais le dernier

Quand on s'est embrassés
La lune s'est cachée
Et tout s'est transformé

Seuls, tous les deux sur la plage,
Seuls, seuls avec notre amour,

Dans ce divin séjour,

Je vous cherchais en vain

Ravissait tes (mes) yeux
Mon cœur écoutait

Que j’en pleurerais ?

Et robe blanche
Adieu premier soupir de mes quinze ans (tes beaux serments n’ont pas duré longtemps)

C’est la rengaine
Plaisir d’amour ne dure pas longtemps (qu’un moment)

Car après l’été
Arrive l’automne
Dans mon cœur résonne
Ton amour fêlé
Nous chantons l’été
Nous pleurons l’automne
Mon cœur te pardonne
D’avoir tant pleuré

Par toi j’ai connu

Merveilleuse ivresse

Ton coeur ne pensait qu'à la tendresse
D'un coeur qui devait le fair' souffrir un jour.

Kalinka chante-moi cette chanson
Du bon vieux temps.
Kalinka souviens-toi
Qu'après l'hiver vient le printemps
Remplie d'espérance la vie recommence
Le temps du bonheur sonnera dans tous les coeurs.
Kalinka te voilà plus belle qu'à vingt ans,
Kalinka tu n'as pas à regretter le bon vieux temps
Toujours de la terre baignée de lumière
S'en va vers le ciel un chant d'amour éternel
Kalinka c'est pour toi que le soleil se lèvera
Kalinka c'est pour toi que le printemps refleurira.
Kalinka tu verras qu'un autre amour viendra vers toi !",Kalinka

Et quand son âme me l'a quitté
Un rossignol quelque part a chanté

Mais je ne peux le dire désormais
Il a emporté avec lui

Qui dans leurs fragiles corolles
Abritent bien souvent des coeurs

Qui pleurent tout bas dans les fleurs

A la saison des violettes.
Suzon venait d'avoir seize ans
Et ses deux grands yeux innocents
Ressemblaient aux douces fleurettes.
Elle dit à son amoureux
Qui partait pour les mers lointaines
Pour les violettes prochaines
Nous nous marierons tous les deux
Mais plusieurs printemps se passèrent
Sans que son fiancé revint
Et plusieurs fois dans les jardins,
Les violettes se fanèrent.

Les nocturnes !

A Java il était née
Un' poupée
Une poupée si jolie
Qu'on eut dit
Un bijou ou un joujou,
Qu'on adore et qui rend fou
Un étranger en passant
La voyant
Lui dit :
Viens donc à Paris
Ma jolie !
Les plaisirs et les désirs
Te feront
Reine ou démon !

Viens danser,
Viens donner
Des baisers,

Te garder
Pour toujours !

Et tout Paris acclama Riquita
Elle vit dans la folie
De l'orgie.
Un regard de ses beaux yeux
Fait d'un homme un malheureux !
A tout l'monde ell' se promet,
Et jamais
Son coeur n'a pu se donner.
Ni aimer
Elle rit quand vous pleurez.
Et le pleur' quand vous chantez !

Qu'à Paris
Je trouverais le bon-heur,

J'ai gardé la nostalgie,
Du ciel bleu de mon pays !
Ah ! ce qu'il m'ont fait souffrir,
Vos plaisirs
Laissez-moi.
Je veux partir
Ou mourir

M'a chanté votre chanson !

1.
Au restaurant, certain soir.
Charmé par ses grands yeux noirs.
Il se dit : qui est elle
Et voulut savoir.
Or, un vieillard près de lui.
Souriant avec mépris,
En lui montrant la belle.
Tout bas répondit :
Jeune homme, éloignez-vous,
Oubliez ces yeux qui rendent fous.


Zaza ! c'est une femme
Pour qui les hommes sont des joujoux, des pantins.
On dit qu'elle est infâme.
Malheur à qui la rencontre sur son chemin.
Zaza, c'est l'enjôleuse.
Qui vend son corps et que l'amour ne peut charmer
Zaza, c'est une gueuse !
Une menteuse.
Qui fait pleurer.


2.
Profitant de la leçon.
Le jeune et riche garçon
S'amusa de la belle
Toute une saison.
Je t'aime, dit-elle un jour.
Mais lui, riant à son tour.
Tout en se moquant d'elle.
Lui dit sans détour :
Allons ! pas de chichis !
De toi tu sais bien ce que l'on dit !


Zaza ! c'est une femme

3.
L'amour est un chant vainqueur
Qui chante dans tous les coeurs.
Et Zaza la cruelle
Connut la douleur.
Mais quand l'amant fut parti.
Fuyant le passé maudit,
Je suis punie, dit-elle.
Mon rêve est fini...
Et toujours, maintenant.
Elle souffre en songeant à l'absent.


Zaza n'est plus la femme
Pour qui les hommes sont des joujoux, des pantins.
On dit que dans son âme.
Est née la fleur du repentir et du chagrin.
Zaza, n'est plus la gueuse.
Et sa bonté lui fait pardonner son passé !
Zaza, l'ensorceleuse.
C'est l'amoureuse
Au coeur brisé...",Zaza

1.
Les nuits d'été quand Montmartre est en fête
Dans le décor d'un cabaret mondain
On voit Lélio le danseur argentin
Par ses yeux noirs faire tourner les têtes
Et brune et blonde en joyeux tourbillon
Vers lui s'en vont au son de la musique
Comme attirés par les feux électriques
Par la fenêtre entrent des papillons

REFRAIN

Les papillons de nuit s'envolent vers la flamme
Comme aux feux de l'amour s'en vont toutes les âmes
Et l'on voit chaque soir sous le ciel de minuit
Se dérouler le même drame
Lorsqu'on entend vibrer le coeur ardent des femmes
Et que l'on voit voler les papillons de nuit

2.
Frappant la lampe à grands coups de ses ailes
L'insecte d'or aux reflets de velours
S'y brûle mais il y revient toujours
Malgré la flamme aux morsures cruelles
Et c'est ainsi que Lélio le danseur
Qui fait souffrir les femmes qui l'adorent
Les voit vers lui tourbillonner encore
Malgré l'angoisse où se plonge leur coeur

3.
Un soir Lélio choisit une amoureuse
Elle s'écrie : ""enfin c'est le bonheur !""
Mais le cruel comme on brise une fleur
Le lendemain chasse la malheureuse
Elle en mourra le coeur désespéré...
Ainsi qu'on voit les ailes palpitantes
Tomber enfin des lampes éclatantes
Agonisants les papillons dorés


Les papillons de nuit se brûlent à la flamme
Comme aux feux de l'amour se déchirent les âmes

Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Finding another world.

Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Georgia Gibbs,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love

He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,

One could not walk,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

Georgie Fame,"One night long ago by the light of the moon,
An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little coloured boy.

You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.

You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.

Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,

Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,

That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?

Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,

And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.",The Old Music Master

Small fry, should be in the school room
My, my, put down that cigarette
You ain't grown up high and mighty yet

Small fry, dancin' for a penny
Small fry, countin' up how many
My, my, just listen here to me
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea

You practice peckin' all day long to some old radio song
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, you better listen to your paw
And someday practice the law
And then you'll be a real success

Yes, small fry, you kissed the neighbour's daughter
Small fry, shoulda stay in shallow water
Seems I should take you cross my knee

Georgie Fame,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Precious to me like a rosary

The love smolders away to an ember
And dreams perish, we'll still cherish

Darlo todo sabiendo 
Cómo acabará después
Esperando a que esta sea 
La última vez que se deja llevar
Que se deja llevar

Sabe quién es 
Y lo sabe llevar

Uoh, uoh, uoh

Georgina,"Ya se que es mejor
Cuando es poco a poco
Que menos es mas
Aunque lo quiera todo
Alguna vez pienso que no siempre es bueno esperar
Cuando estamos juntos
Se me hace tan corto
Que no me doy cuenta
Si lo dimos todo
O lo suficiente para comenzarnos a odiar
Y ahora que ya se lo que hay
Y ahora que ya se lo vez
En mi cabeza loca
Se me olvida que hay que esperar
Un poco mas
Para echarte de menos
Y gritar sin miedo al mundo
Lo que nos queremos
Cuanto tengo que esperar
Para echarte de menos
Y gritarle sin miedo al mundo
La verdad

Que tu y yo nos queremos
Nos queremos de mas
Ya se que es mentira
Que nada es eterno
Que el amor es libre como el pensamiento
Que cuando se acaba
Siempre hay uno que quiere mas
Cuando no lo pienso
Parece tan simple
Dejarme llevar
Como siempre lo hice
Pero ya no quiero volver a sentirme fugaz
Y ahora que ya se lo que ves
Y ahora que ya se lo hay
En mi cabeza loca
Se me olvida que hay que esperar
Un poco mas
Para echarte de menos

Georgina,"Hoy todo parece distinto
Cómo si el mundo quisiera que me pusiera a llorar
Hoy el sol no brilla conmigo
Soy mi peor enemigo
Creo que me caigo mal
Por que hoy tengo la energía de mi propio funeral
Arrugándome la cara
Cuatro calaveras hay en cada esquina de mi cama
Y hay una nube en la ventana que no me deja brillar
Tengo la cabeza llena de películas amargas
Y en vez de principes, fantasmas quieren sacarme a bailar
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho
Nueve y diez, respirar profundo para liberar el estrés
Yo prefiero un beso tuyo
Hoy soy la manzana podrida
Soy el pulgar en la herida
Soy una gracia de más
Hoy, hoy pasa el tiempo muy lento
Y si no lluevo reviento
Mañana espero aclarar

Georgina Weinstein,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

Won't you tell me where my love can be?

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

I don't want to be alone.
Said I don't want to be alone.

And we both got kinda mad.
Did you need a reason baby,
To go out with another man?
If I'm not what you want girl,
Please let me know.
So it won't hurt so bad babe 
When you leave me all alone.

I remember the very first time we met.
I remember, girl I remember.
I remember the very first time I, kissed your lips.
I remember the very first time we slept

Georgio,"Les plus grandes blessures d'nos mères, c'est nos erreurs
Et le soir on s'embrouille, ouais tout part en couille
J'ai pour seule preuve mon cursus scolaire, c'était du sale
Des potes ont dû visser pendant les années au lycée
Regarde nos casiers judiciaires c'était l'époque des amis déguisés
C'était pas facile chez nous, y avait autant d'amour que de cris
En bas les shlags me faisaient stresser, on se prenait pour Al Pacino
Pendant que ton futur amour en boite se faisait frotter
Moi je traînais avec mes chiens de la casse
Mes Antillais, mes lions de l'Atlas
Ma mère voulait pas les voir, à la maison y a pas de place
Sais-tu ce que c'est que de vivre à trois dans un deux pièces
J'ai que 21 ans, je laisse parler ma chance
J'ai tiré avec un flingue sur ma jeunesse
Y'avait Jules et Mounir, pas de filles dans l'équipe
Pas de chichi, ouais tout dans les tripes
On voulait faire des thunes et puis mourir
Des plans de cambriolages finalement jamais faits
J'envie pas ma vie d'avant, mon grand ça sent la défaite (Bah ouais gros)
Little au placard, Dida au placard
9.3, Yanis, les Lilas posés dans une voiture garée
On raconte la journée, la routine
Et moi, tous les jours je fais que rapper, ça me bousille

Des couplets grattés dans ma chambre, et des faces B à l'usine
Pour percer, j'suis tout prêt, je vis de mes concerts j’hallucine
Fini les taff d'été, je suis sur scène et ça me délivre
Dites à mes parents qu'en ce moment, je suis heureux ouais ça c'est dit

Des couplets grattés dans ma chambre, et des faces B à l'usine
Pour percer, j'suis tout prêt, je vis de mes concerts j’hallucine
Fini les taff d'été, je suis sur scène et ça me délivre
Dites à mes parents qu'en ce moment, je suis heureux ouais ça c'est dit

Le tieks avec ve-Stee et Say, Askaan, le petit Fayssal
L'amour, les yeux revolvers, 5 ans après, j'esquive ses balles
Les 3 femmes de ma vie, tu les connais
Ma mère, Salomé et Anissa, pardonnez moi la trixe-ma
L'alcool comme solution, hardcore
Encore un pote qui tombe de la faute à pas d'bol
J'ai oublié mes résolutions, musclé grâce à mes 5 étages
À monter mes briques de lait, oublie jamais l'son
Si un jour je déprime de trop, et qu'un asile me berce

Des couplets grattés dans ma chambre, et des faces B à l'usine

Loin des fans, des soucis,
Loin d'être mal et tout petit, ha ouais c'est grave
J'étais à Aulnay chez mes gars et je passe mon temps avec le rap
On se bousille, ma grand-mère s'inquiète grave,
Appelle sur mes deux portables
Mais je ne réponds qu'à mon statut d'irresponsable
Je m'endors dans des trains, en Ile-De-France j'ai tissé ma toile
Et pour éviter la BAC on rentrait dans des cinés par derrière
La ville comme seule adversaire, avec mes amis, mes frères
Que j'ai perdu pour la plupart au fil des anniversaires
Personne me dira ""Là, t'abuses"", j'étais un petit démon
Assez bon pour retarder ma première garde à vue
On l'a pas dit au reste de la famille, je leur ai fait la guerre
Et je m'en veux, aujourd'hui je fais des envieux
Mais je les mets à l'abri

J'me tue à vous dire qu'mes gars fumaient pour oublier
Maintenant, sont obligés d'arrêter pour fuir la routine
Ou t'en perds tes proches, ta tête, nique la philo de Pierre Desproges
Ou t'auras plus qu'à prier les dieux grecs comme Perséphone
Quand t'en arrives là c'est grave, ah, oui, ouais, ouais

Une fois, par un minuit lugubre, tandis que je m'appesantissais, 
faible et fatigué, sur maint curieux et bizarre volume de savoir oublié 
Tandis que je dodelinais de la tête, somnolant presque 
soudain se fit un heurt, comme de quelqu'un frappant doucement, 
frappant à la porte de ma chambre, cela seul et rien de plus

En attendant l'premier l'album, j'rappe que des questions sans réponse
Ouais j'ai pas d'biff
J'fais attention au crédit que j'm'accorde
Chaque nuit est l'aventure d'une nouvelle énigme
De nouvelles certitudes aussi belles qu'une poupée de la rue d'Aerschot
Une seule a volé mon cœur, mais c'est des pirates vos sœurs
J'imagine que ça sera pire les frères, quand on vivra de nos œuvres
Mais c'est la vie c'est pas un film attiré par tout ce qui brille
J'déprime comme Fuzati et ton appart ça devient l'virage d'Auteuil
On fout l'bordel avec mes potes, on se saoule
Et on refait l'monde en deux, trois textes, arrête

Qui m'ferait prendre, un aller sans retour sur un Paris Bruxelles
Avec mes bulles d'air, j'continue la marche pour aller, je n'sais où
Condamné à devenir vieux et con, puisque je suis jeune et fou

J'avais rien prévu d'autre pour mon samedi soir que d'écrire un texte

Paire de Nike et soucis, on prend les mêmes et on recommence
J'suis vert de rage loin d'être une perle rare
On se capte tout près de l'épicerie
Bah ouais j'comptais pas vraiment bouger d'là en Féfé
J'ai toujours pas l'permis et j'reste bouffé par l'anxiété

Alors j'écris mes sentiments sur feuilles, je décris les sirènes d'ambulance

Paradoxe, j'parlais d'suicide, j'pense à celle sans qui j'serais pas là
Pour qui j'tiens malgré mes balafres
J'habite un quartier d'chiens ou les anciens sont tous en galère de pascal
Mais ils font avec ça, trompent les douanes, vendent des fausses cigarettes
La routine et les petites galères, chaque jour ils affrontent l'état
En fait en ce moment j'ai plus d'portable ouais mais j'suis pas tout l'temps seul

Mais vas-y roule accélère mon pote
Roule, avant que nos routes se séparent
Il y a peut être du bien dans tout ça
Si j'avais été droit j'serais pas debout à écrire
À cette heure-ci, j'serais entrain d'pioncer peinard

Il met des robes et se maquille
Joue avec des Barbies
J'te jure qu'il est bizarre mais c'est un homme quand il monte les courses de Maman
Des potes à moi l'ont roué de coups c'est navrant
Les voisins étaient descendus dans le hall avaient entendu le bordel
Et l'entendaient crier ""Qu'est-ce tu vas faire ducon?""
Là, il parlait pas, il avait honte et les larmes aux yeux sous sa perruque blonde
Autant d'violence pour quelques bruits, quelques remarques et une sacré différence
Qui gêne pas les voisins non mais dans l'immeuble divise les gens
Il y a ceux indifférents
Ils lui parlent pas sauf quand il y a pas d'lumière dans l'couloir
Ils persistent à croire qu'il se change pas l'soir
Au fond, ils savent qu'il aime porter ses jupes, ses rouges à lèvres
Mais pour pas foutre la merde, il se transforme en ce qu'il devrait être
Un homme, pour plaire à ceux qui votent à droite, petit couple raciste
Avec un fils qui écoute du rap qui parle mal de la vie
Tout aussi con que les deux jumeaux d'Aïda, 
Elle c'est la turque qui habite au premier
Ses petits ils traînent dehors, 
Parce que leur appart' donne vue sur un type qui pourrait crever
Chaque jour que Dieu fait
Un clochard qui a vendu sa mère pour une bouteille de rouge
Il lui faudrait deux béquilles remplies d'amour pour qu'il puisse tenir debout
Il y a qu'le gardien qui l'apprécie
De temps en temps il le nourrit et ça, ouais ça plaît pas à tout l'monde
Ça fait un mois que je l'ai pas vu mais quand il reviendra ça sera pour de bon
De toute façon il y a que le gardien
Qu'on appelle la petite de-blon
Ancien footballeur, des coupes sur ses étagères
Chez mon pote je m'en fous mais chez lui ça montre qu'il est tout sauf réfractaire
Homme sensible mais femme à caractère
L'homme est gardien et la femme est passagère
Tous les jeudis il se fait livrer des légumes par un agriculteur d'Île-de-France
À défaut de recevoir des insultes vides de sens
Il se comprend pas lui-même, a l'impression d'être malade
A besoin d'affection
Pas d'ces amants les traîne-savates
Paradoxalement, j'crois qu'il avait la haine contre l'amour
Mais on l'saura jamais il a plongé du haut de la tour",Le  gardien
Georgio,"Avant que j'commette une mutinerie envers ma propre personne
Offre moi une dernière soirée funeste
Avant que j'me rebelle contre l'homme que j'aurais dû être
J'décharge mon stylo et mon flingue est une énigme
J'suis le Petit Prince de la famille Edouard pas d'Saint Exupéry
Ne pas croire au destin serait du délire, moi, qui écrit tous les jours
Saleté d'Rap comme j'aurais pu vivre saleté d'shit sous les tours
On a nos torts, on a notre fierté, sur l'chèque y a jamais trop d'zéros
Avec ma bande on s'appelle ""frère"", on est les fils de Dionysos

Le poing levé, les yeux bandés, j'me bats sans savoir où ça mène
J'ai l'choix entre le quartier ou faire le tour d'la Terre
Donc j’accélère, papy, avec un air arrogant
J'conduis sans permis une Fé-fé rouge qui suit des drapeaux blancs

Le poing levé, les yeux bandés, j'me bats sans savoir où ça mène
J'ai l'choix entre le quartier ou faire le tour d'la Terre
Donc j’accélère, papy, avec un air arrogant
J'conduis sans permis une Fé-fé rouge qui suit des drapeaux blancs

Qu'est-ce que je m'en fous de ta bonne drogue
Rien nous calmera, on a grandit comme des loups
Pas un petit bourg' qui suit des cours à la Sorbonne
J'ai connu les bagarres avant de disparaître dans le cri d'une femme
Le souffle court, pouvoir m'livrer, être plus que nu à l'abri des regards
Ça parle de roman, de s'ressusciter mais mon passé est illicite
Le rapper serait difficile, ça pue la violence et les regrets
La malchance et l'échec à des années d'une vie biblique
J'suis à des millénaires d'être en paix avec moi-même
J'me lève vers 9h, détrompe-toi, j'suis déréglé avec la Terre
Éméché, j'rentre dans l'moule, sans rancune, sans embrouille
J'entends plus l'sang qui coule, faut donner un sens à tout ça
Quand j'rentre chez moi dans un quartier dit sensible
Nos ancêtres sont pas gaulois, est-ce pour ça qu'tu nous licencie?
On a nos torts, on a notre fierté, sur l'chèque y'aura jamais trop d'zéros
Avec ma bande, on s'appelle ""frère"", on est les fils de Dionysos

Donc j’accélère, papy, avec un air arrogant
J'conduis sans permis une Fé-fé rouge qui suit des drapeaux blancs

J'ai pas choisi d'être ici ni d'piller Velizy 2
J'ai remis en question l’intérêt de vivre vieux on me comprendra mort tel Friedrich Nietzche
À l'instar des autres, j'suis unique, inlassable et votre
J'vide mes instincts marginaux et fauves et si tu pries
Prie pour qu'on s'rappelle de moi, qu'on ait de quoi s'défendre, s'détendre
Prie pour tes proches et surtout prie pour qu'ils arrêtent de boire
Est-il en notre temps rien de plus odieux
De plus désespérant que de ne pas croire en Dieu?
J'voudrais avoir la foi, la foi d'ma mère, qui est heureuse
Comme un vendeur d'arme mais moins con qu'la guerre, malheureusement
Nous c'est les doutes et les coups d'blues bercés par des problèmes de fric
Des histoires de tess, on a des raisons pour des colères stupides
Apaisés par la drogue et malmenés par la proc'
Les soupirs d'une mère fatiguée, à la fenêtre telle une parabole
On a nos torts, on a notre fierté, sur l'chèque y'a jamais trop d'zéros

Georgio,"Traîner avec des gens sans opinion ça flatte l'orgueil
Un regard, une critique et tu deviens vite ce schlague qui parle tout seul
Dessine le monde petit
Et adoucis les traits d'la vie
Quand on lit l'avenir dans des mains mais que des rides racontent des douleurs
Traverser des hivers doux puis des rivières pourpres
Suis tes rêves suis tes fidèles troupes
Je te parle de ceux que t'appelles frères
Ceux qui t'aident à combattre tes idées troubles
Ceux qui seront dans ton navire quand ce sera ton heure de niquer tout
Fini le moral qui fait des vagues
Tu deviens un homme plus le connard qui fait des blagues
C'est archaïque t'es le lion, protège ta lionne et tu t'feras apprécier des femmes
Quelques conseils de proches entre deux pintes de bière
Pas une fontaine de rhum
On vit avec un anaconda autour du cou
Viens dans ma jungle mais fais pas ton Martien
Cherche pas l'amour il est au fond du gouffre
Les oreilles saignent entre la musique, les cris, les petites emmerdes
Et moi, je m'enferme dans toutes mes crises existentielles
Et vivre en vrai c'est accepter d'mourir
Et j'vais pas m'étouffer avec tes chrysanthèmes
J'ai appris seul
C'est la paresse qui m'enseigne la survie
J'veux pas rentrer dans les normes ni rester l'ado ivre
Anonyme donc adorable
Mais j'deviens cet homme contaminé par la folie
Appauvri sous son anorak
Et l'jugement des gens s'atrophie et c'est pas normal
Elle est pas belle la blonde?
Si mais avec un noir donc tu monteras pas dans l'même wagon
On marche en bande comme Adidas, mais on est plus que trois
Paris, c'est les vitrines qui prouvent que la ville te nargue
Évite-moi s'il te plaît vie de merde
Des fiches de paye dans des sales délires
Claquer des billets dans des taxis d'nuit
Qu'est-ce qu'on s'en fout de tes malheurs, que t'aies un cœur ou pas sous l'débardeur
Puis t'as beau être saoulé par Dieu, 
Il peut te sauver l'jour où une salope te fait goûter l'taser
(Oui le monde est un visage qui pleure)
Des cheveux en nuages et des yeux arc en ciel
On s'appelle frère pour quelques grammes, l'amitié doit être soldable en fait
C'est pas pour autant que t'achèteras la confiance d'Anatole
C'est pas la fée Carabosse mais j'fais que glacer l'sang de ma daronne
Bref, ça vend du mauvais shit laisse passer tant qu'ça rapporte
Jusqu'à ce qu'un tox' décu t'ramène les keufs à ta porte
Jusqu'à ce que ta mère déçue te mette à la porte, dans la peau d'un SDF
Le temps d'une nuit
D'un appel chez un pote ou tu devras rester zen

Y'a trop de naissances y'a trop de morts
Peu importe si l'avenir est infect ou si la vie est un test
On combat la routine avec le rope a dope (rope a dope)
On reste dans les cordes en attendant la brèche

Y'a trop de naissances y'a trop de morts
Peu importe si l'avenir est infect ou si la vie est un test
On combat la routine avec le rope a dope (rope a dope)
On reste dans les cordes en attendant la brèche

J'perds mes principes, ceux pour qui j'avais dit jamais
On s'oublie puis on s'actualise dans les yeux d'une pute qui disparaît
J'ai perdu mon innocence évidemment j'suis plus un p'tit enfant
Silence, quand elle se rhabille elle est plus belle que l'argent de Nino Brown
Cinquante euros plus tard, Amsterdam paradis du diable 
Comme la chapelle est un bon ami du crack
T'imagines pas comment ça fait mal de voir des gosses près des toxs 
Qu'ont cru que pour se droguer les parcs avaient des bancs adéquats
T'imagines pas ce qu'on trimballe dans des sacs de sport fais plus l'idiot
Les salles de shoot c'est pas pour tirer des coups francs comme Juninho
Un problème résolu un autre arrive
À mon avis c'est comme ça pour tout le monde
La vie est une énigme que l'on méprise sans parler du destin
C'est toi qui décide et si on suit ma théorie on est jamais au bout du compte
Jouer aux archéologues dans son enfance crever les yeux de cette poupée d'soucis
Arracher les pneus de cette voiture de mésentente
Tout en aimant encore des souvenirs éparpillés 
Dans des problèmes des factures et d'autres papiers
On a tellement fait de guerres à nos parents que j'fais plus la diff'
Entre le fils de colon le fils d'artiste et le fils d'ouvrier
On cohabite tous prêts du diable loin de la cordillère des anges 
Maintenant tu sais qui mène la danse dans nos bateaux pirates
On fait chavirer les flics avec nos vies de zonards
Question fille j'suis indécis j'ferais le bonheur des dames de façon triste tel Émile Zola
Y'a plus d'alcool dans mes textes que de whisky dans le coca
J'ai fait trop d'accidents c'est vrai pour pouvoir dormir dans de beaux draps
J'me suprends à mettre des corps dans le drap blanc
L'amitié c'est précieux mais décu pour compter j'me coupe des phallanges
Les salles plans la galère rien de tel pour que j'manie le mic
La vie c'est dure demande aux absents qui fréquentaients la rive droite
J'rappe les épiphanies comme Fauve t'en perds tes mots
J'aime cette femme qui sait qu'son môme n'aura pas de père dès qu'elle perds les eaux
C'est pour mes soss' en mandats de dépôts qu'arrêtent pas de lire Malcolm X
Pour mes gars qui vont mal dormir cuisinent sur des réchauds 
Pendant qu'la famille s'appauvrit
La petite sœur a droit à des mensonges perpétuels on s'doit d'tenir
Et le voisinage sert les coudes non c'est pas Plus belle la vie
Ouais mamie ton petit-fils fait du rap et j'grave mes peines sur Verbatim
Paraîtrait même que j'peux en vivre j'sais pas moi j'veux m'donner les moyens
Paroles d'un utopiste qu'a plus d'estime pour tous les doyens

Y'a trop de naissances y'a trop de morts
Peu importe si l'avenir est infect ou si la vie est un test
On combat la routine avec le rope a dope (rope a dope)
On reste dans les cordes en attendant la brèche

Y'a trop de naissances y'a trop de morts
Peu importe si l'avenir est infect ou si la vie est un test
On combat la routine avec le rope a dope (rope a dope)
On reste dans les cordes
En attendant la brèche",Rope a Dope
Georgio,"Ouais le paradis existe mais avant que la mort t'emporte
Sors-toi de la tempête du vice
Du moins de la vente de drogues
Fuck les potes emprisonnés (ouais ouais)
Moi j'tue tout dans l'rap, un bic en guise de pistolet
Faut faire les choses malgré mes gros des défauts j'ai
Aucune peur de marcher dans les tieks
T'as vu la lune hassoul j'viens la décrocher
J'ai rappé dans des caves comme j'ai rappé dans des fêtes
J'reste bien sapé en lère-ga tah les habitant des states
J'aimerai bien mais ça serait t'mentir
J'traine ma poisse et mon vieux Lacoste
J'avoue j'garde la classe et j'mets les vieux d'accord
Et c'est textuellement pire, j'fais valser les mesures
Impossible d'arrêter l'truc
Tu sens la chatte et les thunes t'es pire qu'un mytho de Châtelet
Moi c'est la rue ça sent le crack et les pûtes
A Maxdo on a de quoi armer tes gus
Evitons d'parler, tu prends l'mic et tu casses des gueules
Tu rentres tu bois t'éclates des geush
Prions pour que t'épargnes les keufs

Sinon c'est garde av' et zonzon, dis en revoir à tes gavas, tes fausses blondes
Même si on s'en tape des tatass des ghettos de l'ombre
Sors le pare-balle
La France est un pays racistes
Non l'oncle Sam n'est pas un fidèle ami
Ah oui oui, j'arrive panique pas
En scooter dans un appart' du 16 avec trois dix grammes
Mais on m'a dit quoi
""Georgio c'est cool atterris mets bien ceux qui t'aidaient avant qu'tu rimes comme Rakim
Ou que tu pèses comme le boule de la zouz' à Jay-z
Parce que l'rap c'est casse-gueule tah les groupes d'la té-ci""
J'pense à Versus et So ils sont capables de te froisser
Si tu craches sur la vertu des nôtres et si tu parles sur ma technique t'explose
Comme ça c'est dit rap de bâtiments Haussmanniens et pauvres
C'est cru, c'est malsain et beau
Ça sent les Assedic, les plats d'Afrique de l'Est
Barbare ma clique te laisse sur l'sol avec des tates-pa 
Après un traquenard sur ma vie que j'te baise
Tu connais le diez d'la rue Chapelle au square Léon!
Toi tu parles tah les on dit sur mes cheveux qui pousse
Mais quand j'rap j'goume un paquet d'cons
T'assumeras pas m'avoir vu
Tu nous fera croire que dans l'rap bah t'as des sosies",T'as pas d'sosie
Georgio,"Je connais des mecs jaloux, des couples pas nets
Dans nos vies, y'a beaucoup de barrières
J'aurais jamais dû prendre maman pour la reine
Parce que papa c'était le roi
Leur divorce m'a rendu fou
J'vis au dernier étage de la tour d'Babel
Les tourments embrassent mes nuits à stagner dans nos halls
J'enlace les vices, pire qu'un père
Caressé par l'espoir de gagner au loto
Plus de chances de se scratcher en moto
Ou de faire un accident de T max
D'repenser à sa vie assis dans ses larmes
On aimerait bien s'épanouir en interim
Penser à rien, pédaler sur un vélib'
Tu sais où j me vois près du canal st martin
Dans un parc à m'étaler sur la belle vie
Ma foi c'est pas tout rose, hier j'étais au parloir
Ça s'efface pas de ma tête
Mon pote se rassurait et me parlait du destin
Du prince de machiavel
Il arrivait pas à s'empêcher de pleurer, me dit que tout l'esquinte
Il m'a demandé, ""Est-ce possible de faire marche-arrière?""
Et c'est pas facile quand tu sors pas de ta tanière
Paris est mon asile, y'a pas la mer
Mais des cascades de Jack Daniels

Faut chercher un sens à la vie dans la tour de Babel
Tu cours à ta perte
Retrouver ton amour dans la foule et la guerre
Choisir ses potes et ses armes
Prendre ses clopes et des claques
Sortir dehors et c'est le drame, 
Si t'as pas cherché un sens à la vie dans la tour de Babel
Tu cours a ta perte
Retrouver ton amour dans la foule et la guerre
Choisir ses potes et ses armes
Prendre ses clopes et des claques
Sortir dehors et c'est l'drame
Si t'as pas
Ton appart' avec ta femme et tes gosses
Si t'as pas
Travail et passion de quoi faire rêver tes proches
Si t'as pas
Des soirs d'ambition tu crèves avec tes potes
Et ton quartier si t'as pas d'idées ouais pour tout quitter

Il s'agit de faire les choses carrées pour faire tourner la terre ronde
Dans mon monde pour la soulever la bête à bourrer la belle blonde
Et c'est presque pareil
Dans un bar à hôtesses de Pigalle
Ça c'est quand les hommes mariés voient le cygne devenir une migalle
Dix ans après avoir caché le bif, sous ton lit avec un schlass
Et une balance de bijoutier, une avalanche de vies troublées
Des mecs qui bé-tom, des mecs qui sortent, des mecs qui s refont
Des mecs devenus des saltimbanques qui lavent tes p'tits souliers

Faut chercher un sens à la vie dans la tour de Babel
Tu cours à ta perte

Sortir dehors et c'est l drame
Si t'as pas ma chance

Avec les dames je me sens coupable dans l'échec
Pour m sauver c'est pas possible
J suis un coup de schlass dans le désert
On s remettra ensemble jusqu'à ce qu'on s déteste
Je la connais depuis l' lycée, c'est magique
Paris c'est Poudlard si tu préfères
J comprends pas de quoi tu parles avec ta vie d'artiste
?
J'ai pas passé le bac j'aime faire le dur
Acharné dans la vie de la street
Tu prends du plomb dans l'aile ou du plomb dans la tête
Mais tes menaces ne marchent pas
T'es pire qu'une bombe dans la mer
Dans le bien ou dans le mal on grimpe comme le cour de l'euro
On fait les sourdes oreilles en sortie de garde av'
Ouais tu remets tes lacets et tu renfiles tes rêves
Loin des villas de Soucis, proches des taudits de la maille
On touche le bois d'Ikea
On se doit de sauver les meubles
Paraît que la vie c'est hard
Hugo c'est l'boss, depuis j'm'habille plus comme un misérable
Les montagnes se rencontrent pas
On est loin d'en être sur ma tour de Babel
J'ai vu un nazi jacter avec un juif de Barbès

Georgio,"On marche dans la ville, mes gars tiennent leurs bouteilles par l'goulot
Touche à la famille, y'aura des bénévoles pour l'sale boulot
Rien ne sert de menacer, on sait que t'excelles dans le blabla
J'ai jamais tapé d'la C, posé dans des grands appart'
J'manie les lettres, mes textes sont meilleurs qu'des mandats cash
J'ai aucune dette mais j'suis stressé, comme un trader de Goldman Sachs
Oh la la, pose la came c'est d'la frappe c'est trop crapuleux, déçu?
Tu vas pas assumer comme un frère amoureux d'une pute
Quoi de plus fort le bonheur avec ou la tristesse sans
La routine un viol auquel on assiste pleinement
On s'dit qu'ça va au bord de la falaise, que y'a pire
Regarde le fumer son crack près du bowling de Porte de la Chapelle
J'représente le district et vite j'file, échapper les viles-ci
Ces victimes se prennent pour des rappeurs bling-bling
Bang bang c'est si triste, des bêtes de ballons
Ça flirt avec le triple six dans un survêt' de Chelsea

Incompris dans le rap tels les Beasties Boys
Hystérique comme une p'tite qui chiale
En contrôle les flics m'isolent, j'te croise ça fait click click baw
C'est embêtant je déteste la violence je préfère la romance
Mais si tu joues trop l'arrogant, j'suis obligé de te rentrer dedans
Même si ça m'fait mal au cœur je te mets des droites avec la main qu'écrit mes textes
Prends-toi mes droits d'auteur
Et pour le reste tu veux l'astuce envoie du Sky' j'te la donne
J'crache le feu, j'suis éclairé par les flammes de la mort
C'est pour les dentistes qui finissent édentés
Les grossistes qui mettent du biff' dans un matelas éventré
J'ai fait les quatre cent coups avec des milliards de frères
On a trop de proches là haut pour eux
On est devenus des pirates de l'air
J'ai mes failles, j'ai mes qualités
J'ai mes shrabs, que des gars sûrs que même ma mère a validé
Pour demain, j't'avoue que j'ai pas d'idée
Une chose est sûre, nos bagages sont prêts on s'laissera plus dévaliser!

On s'détruit depuis nos quinze-seize ans
Alcool, shit, médicaments
La sale vie des familles françaises, j'suis pas né dans l'seize
Donc j'en place une pour le RER et mes amis d'enfance
Pour tous les êtres perdus qui cherchent des projets
Chaque semaine, la routine met des crochets
Puisque même trouver le sommeil est devenu un combat
Y'en a qu'attendent la mort pour s'endormir dans de beaux draps
Ouais les filles faut pas trop kiffer
J'suis qu'un enculé qu'on encule pas, malgré ma sexualité débridée
Mon phone sonne, bien sûr qu'j'laisse filer

Georgio,"En un coup d'fil, j'peux changer d'programme pour la semaine
Quitter l'béton sous mes semelles, sans aucune raison foutre la merde
Dans ma tête, à croire que c'est en moi, le paradis ou l'enfer
Monsieur Politique roule en Benz, j'suis anarchiste et j'l'emmerde
J'crache ma rage sous des réverbères depuis que j'ai lâché mes repères
Puis j'suis mon propre Nord, j'ai peu de remords et les même frères
J'sais pas si on est d'la poussière d'étoiles
Quand l'ciel te parle, écoute-le bien, j'crois au destin
Mais j'suis pas devin, moi j'reste esclave, on s'doute de rien
On mène nos vies sans penser qu'ils achètent nos rêves
Y'a plus d'amour dans les familles quand l'manque d'argent kidnappe Noël
Chacun son combat, pas l'choix faut trouver pourquoi
On va s'lever, serrer des mains à des enculés en restant courtois
Des cernes sous les yeux, mais difficile à capter
Rappelle-toi des promesses qu'on s'était faîtes mais qu'on a foiré
Et malgré ça chaque jour on monte des marches
Et si on s'arrête, on est là, on s'remotive et on r'démarre

Des cernes sous les yeux
Dessine mes traits d'caractère dans des tâches de sang
Ma vie j'y mets l'feu
J'suis la nature, qui s'laisse bercer par le vent

Enfin l'été, la plage entre Cannes et Nice
Les femmes que mes potes draguent, nos caractères qui s'embellissent
J'préfère rester dur, vu qu'j'suis pur et qu'il y a plein d'envieux
Loin d'être parano j'rattrape mon sommeil dans des trains d'banlieue
Si tu savais tout ce que j'voyais, c'est surprenant
J'connais la tess et les bourgeois, et j'vis plus vite que souffle le vent
Certes avec beaucoup d'lacunes, je sais que j'sais rien
J’idolâtre les gens cultivés, et ceux qui cultivent la tune
On fait du mal aux terriens à être si bêtes
J'veux plus lire tes conneries sur internet
Quand tu parles, ma liberté s'arrête
Dans une autre vie j'ferai sauter les frontières tels les murs de Fresnes
P't-être qu'ensuite, on s'aimera pour de vrai
C'est pas facile d'imaginer l'monde, autre que sous tension
Alors j'écris et j'essaye d'y mettre le fond et la forme
Pourquoi pas apaiser les esprits le temps d'un album?
Pour mettre en forme tous les gens qui touchent le fond

Des cernes sous les yeux
Dessine mes traits d'caractère dans des tâches de sang
Ma vie j'y mets l'feu
J'suis la nature, qui s'laisse bercer par le vent

Des cernes sous les yeux
Dessine mes traits d'caractère dans des tâches de sang
Ma vie j'y mets l'feu
J'suis la nature, qui s'laisse bercer par le vent

J'ai fais des fautes et des coups bas, rien d'grave
Et pour jeter l'encre, y'a que les photos d'N'Kruma
J'lui rappe mes textes au téléphone
Puis on s'attrape en bas de l'immeuble (Georges!)
J'lui jette les clés par la fenêtre, vieux bâtiment sans interphone
Pas très longtemps qu'j'habite Pantin
J'roule ma bosse, avec ou sans mes soss, sur mon vélo sans frein
À part ma flemme, qui peut m'empêcher d'écrire?
L'album aurait pu s'appeler ""Je""
Ou ""Le mépris des autres pour l'amour des miens""

Georgio,"Les liens que j'crée sont plus forts que ceux qui s'brisent
Je l'ai appris avec l'âge, en hyperactivité
Quand dans ma jungle urbaine, toutes nos écorces se cassent
Avancer de SOS en cris d'guerre grâce à mes cordes vocales
Ou de promesses en prières, font de moi un homme stable
Passer de la haine à l'amour, puis d'l'amour à la haine
Y'a toute une morale à perdre, tout un combat à refaire
Comme un été d'trop, j'étouffe comme un métro rempli
Comme un accord commun entre ma conscience
Et puis un crime commis
Personne n'imagine à quel point c'est dur d'élever un père qui part
Parole d'enfant d'un divorce interminable
J'revois encore des coups qui fusent avec mon frère
Jouer aux arbitres, j'compte y passer mes prochaines années
Mais dur d'parler d'avenir

C'est plus que d'la musique ou des textes
C'est ma vie, mes cauchemars, mes névroses, mes envies
En une couleur c'est bleu noir, c'est bleu noir
Comme une tâche d'encre sur ma feuille blanche
C'est plus que d'la musique ou des textes
C'est ma vie, mes cauchemars, mes névroses, mes envies
En une couleur c'est bleu noir, c'est bleu noir

Y'a pas qu'aux putes que tu peux parler d'trottoir
J'ai dormi dans la street, déménagé trop d'fois
Dans les HLM de province, les foyers d'Paname
Les squats de banlieue, les requins qui viennent du Roc-Ma
Dans des pompes, personne peut mettre cent eu'
J'vois mon père qui joue aux dés, des mecs au ballon
J'ai perdu mon innocence avant d'connaître la balle au prisonnier
J'ai fait mes devoirs, éclairé par des bougies
J'ai promis d'marquer l'histoire
J'vais pas m'faire baiser par des groupies
À Max Do', au terrain vague, on traînait tard la night
J'rappais mes paragraphes d'autres pensaient à faire de la maille
Chacun sa route, chacun ses doutes, un point c'est tout
On s'appelle pas quand tout va bien
Mais j'sais qu't'es là si un quartier voisin veut en découdre

C'est plus que d'la musique ou des textes
C'est ma vie, mes cauchemars, mes névroses, mes envies
En une couleur c'est bleu noir, c'est bleu noir
Comme une tâche d'encre sur ma feuille blanche
C'est plus que d'la musique ou des textes
C'est ma vie, mes cauchemars, mes névroses, mes envies
En une couleur c'est bleu noir, c'est bleu noir

Qui va m'faire des leçons? Je suis devenu un homme à 15 ans
Rien d'épatant, j'ai déjà rêvé d'femmes de l'âge de ma mère
J'assume ma perversion, mes gars c'est pareil
On veut plus s'épargner, on s'livre, on s'fait mal
Moi j'ai découvert l'amour dans une cage d'escalier
J'ai soif de victoire, et à force de perdre
Plus proche d'l'immigré dans les docks
Que d'la belle famille près d'un port de pêche
Plus proche des mamans à la fenêtre que des francs-maçons
Loin des yeux, près du coeur, mon frère en centre de formation
Difficile de faire sa place, chacun son destin, et
Pas d'autre choix que d'provoquer le changement et y faire face
Que personne me considère comme un arriviste
Qu'on demande aux miens, j'ai multiplié les sacrifices

C'est plus que d'la musique ou des textes
C'est ma vie, mes cauchemars, mes névroses, mes envies
En une couleur c'est bleu noir, c'est bleu noir
Comme une tâche d'encre sur ma feuille blanche
C'est plus que d'la musique ou des textes
C'est ma vie, mes cauchemars, mes névroses, mes envies
En une couleur c'est bleu noir, c'est bleu noir",Bleu noir
Georgio,"Une grand-mère qui part, c’est une bibliothèque qui brûle
Et comme d’habitude, c’est le silence qui hurle
C’est toute ton armure qui devient velours
C’est les regrets qui croisent l’horloge et courent jusqu’à Yom Kippour
C’est trop d’interrogations et sans être cru
Imagine New York sans la 5ème Avenue
C’est toi qui as porté ma mère
C’est vrai qu’ensemble on a croisé le fer
C’était pas facile pour toi
Quand j’étais tout en bas de l’échelle
Et aujourd’hui dans mon cœur il y a ta culture, tes auteurs
La déco de chez moi trouvée dans des vide-ordures
Il y a aussi tes peintres et tes sculpteurs
On y retrouve, la chaleur de l’hiver
Pour un fumeur, la Celle Saint-Cloud c’est l’ennui
Mais aussi la scène, si différente de la mienne
Du haut de ta fenêtre Grand-Mère
Les oiseaux et la solitude
Et des forêts de classes moyennes
Qu’on manipule

Je passerai bientôt te voir, à la Celle Saint-Cloud
On ira contempler ses rives
Comme tu regardes tes rides dans un miroir
Profiter de la neige comme mon père
Qui revient d’Afrique et puis repart
Oh Grand-Mère, je passerai bientôt te voir, à la Celle Saint-Cloud
On ira contempler ses rives
Comme tu regardes tes rides dans un miroir
Profiter de la neige comme mon père
Qui revient d’Afrique et puis repart

Tu t’es retrouvée, à 70 ans dans le rôle d’une mère
Je t’en ai fait voir de toutes les couleurs
Aucune fierté juste des douleurs
J’ai fait déchaîner la houle
Puis des années d’absences
J’ai mis les voiles
Et mon bateau avance
Dans l’orgueil de l’homme
Toutes les larmes sont déferlantes
La tête à l’envers
De ton silence je suis perdant
La Celle Saint-Cloud, la gare, les trains tout tagué
J’ai largué les amarres, et j’reviendrais plus tard
Comme si de rien n’était
Et tu feras de même
Je sais que tu m’aimes plus que cette mauvaise vague
Plus qu’un tsunami quand on parle toute la nuit
Des cendres de mon grand-père, sur le Mont Valérien
De religions oubliées, puis des anges car ils me voient d’un autre monde aérien
Raconte-moi ta Normandie, ta vie dans le XIVème
J’dévoilerai mes promesses
J’oublierai ni virgule ni parenthèses
Du haut de ta fenêtre Grand-Mère
Le feu d’artifice, la vie un point de vue
Et nos yeux ne sont pas magnifiques

Je passerai bientôt te voir, à la Celle Saint-Cloud
On ira contempler ses rives
Comme tu regardes tes rides dans un miroir
Profiter de la neige comme mon père
Qui revient d’Afrique et puis repart
Oh Grand-Mère, je passerai bientôt te voir, à la Celle Saint-Cloud
On ira contempler ses rives
Comme tu regardes tes rides dans un miroir
Profiter de la neige comme mon père
Qui revient d’Afrique et puis repart

Je sais à quel point t’es heureuse de m’avoir dans tes bras
Beaucoup trop d’amour que je n’attendais pas
J’ai honte de l’enfer qu'on a vécu tous les deux
Les yeux dans les yeux, ce feu dans les cieux
Et ne me cache pas ta peur de demain
Et combien même que le temps passe
Tu peux être fière de l’adulte que je deviens
T’as vu à quel point on se ressemble même quand on parle de musique
Tu comprends le rap mieux que les ados qui veulent en vivre
J’aime trop ta sensibilité, quand tu parles des autres
Tes mots sonnent juste, dans ta bouche y’a rarement de fautes
J’t’avoue que j’ai quand même pleins de choses à te dire
À te reprocher, mais faudrait une autre chanson
Une autre rime, un autre projet
J’t’avoue que j’ai quand même pleins de choses à te dire
À te reprocher, mais faudrait une autre chanson
Une autre rime, un autre projet

Georgio,"La solitude est belle, tel un cheval au galop un soir de pleine lune
Oui, j'en suis accro, un peu comme à la thune
Bonheur artificiel, infidélités, plus que d'artifices
Tu veux pas qu'il te ramène du vice
Tu connais la chanson ""laisse pas traîner ton fils""
Les objectifs qui défilent, le sablier qui te dis ""va-t-en!""
Une nuit, une fille, l'eau et le feu
Couchent ensemble dans des draps blancs
Des valises sous les yeux, pourtant les voyages qu'on entreprend
Ne sont que des vœux, des promesses, perdues à travers le temps

Quand mes nuits sont pâles, que j'ai les yeux flammes
Et le cœur embrasé, je r'pense à toi, à tes pensées et toi
Qui comptent trouver l'amour à chaque homme embrassé
J'ai mal, oh oui tu l'sais que j'ai mal
Que c'est plus l'amour, nan, que c'est ma tête qui s'acharne

Dépression, dépression, dépression, dépression
Dépression, dépression, dépression, dépression
Le cerveau qui va exploser
Dépression, dépression, dépression, dépression
J'suis complètement névrosé
Dépression, dépression, dépression, dépression

Tu me détruis, je me détruis, oui, il en est ainsi
J'en suis devenu malade, j'ai de l'assa-somnie
J'ai pas l'impression d'être fou, non, ni l'impression d'être faible
Je cherche de quoi tenir debout, ouais, de quoi retenir mes rêves
Et pas à pas, il n'y plus que l'ombre de moi-même
De longues nuits à méditer, à marcher, à fuir la haine
Et l'odeur de tabac froid, à fuir ma culpabilité
Et mes frustrations, j'entends encore le bruit de ses ongles
Et une phobie plus marquante que le cul d'la blonde
On se bat, contre vents et marées, et nos têtes explosent
À force de penser, on se noie dans l'écume de nos verres d'eau
J'ai mal à la terre, l'amour maternel
Dors le soir dans des cabarets, j'me fais tout petit pour de vrai
Dîtes-moi comment changer les paramètres

Dépression, dépression, dépression, dépression

D'la pluie qui tombe sur un ciré jaune
C'est beau c'est la mélancolie, ma chambre qui sent le fauve
J'pense à mes problèmes quand tous mes frères sont endormis
Impossible de mettre les voiles, j'suis rattaché à c'que j'déteste
J'avance doucement, les pieds dans la vase, l'âme en sang
Et j'tire sur les feux d'détresse, dis-moi, dis-moi, dis-moi
Comment faire des choix, selon ses peurs parfois?
Permets-moi de t'avouer que j'ai l'coeur rempli d'encre, de sang et de boue
Et que je suis rien, tu vois bien que moi j'refuse d'être tatoué
Je veux pouvoir me retrouver nu
D'ailleurs je cherche à me retrouver
Et peut-être j'en suis qu'au début
En tout cas je chercherai à en crever
J'transporte des souvenirs et des regrets
Des images plein la tête, en manque de confort
Pareil à mes projets, me donne mal au gratte-ciel

Georgio,"J't'écris ça début Décembre, j'espère un changement pour l'hiver
J'ai l'impression d'être enfermé dans les mines ouvrières
J'ressens la chaleur, le bruit, le chaos, l'obscurité
J'tombe dans des trous noirs, pourtant ma vie fait que s'améliorer
J'ai du mal à trouver le coupable
Salomé, tu es comme ma moitié
Et parfois on a du mal à communiquer
Alors j'mets des mots durs sur des bouts de papier

Faut survivre dans mes montagnes russes
Entre joies et tristesse, tout est cérébral
Entre fables et chimères, rap et ivresse dans la déprime
J'ai finalement l'impression de m'y retrouver
Souvent j'me dis que j'arrêterai d'écrire le jour où je les soignerai
J'te vois prendre soin d'moi
Pendant qu'tu m'regardes sombrer tu sais
Tu m'redonnes de la force, t'es comme un ange tombé du ciel
J'passe des heures inactives dans mon lit à écouter d'autres rappeurs
J'me dis qu'sous mon toit j'peux pas croiser des oiseaux d'malheur

Dans ma chambre d'hôpital, y'a les miens qui crèvent
Oh Salomé si tu savais, c'est pas moi qui vais mal
Encore heureux que je rap, que je pleure des Requiem
Ça prouve que j'suis vivant que j'ai foi en la morale
Dans ma chambre d'hôpital, y'a les miens qui crèvent
Oh Salomé si tu savais, c'est pas moi qui vais mal
Encore heureux que je rap, que je pleure des Requiem
Ça prouve que j'suis vivant que j'ai foi en la morale

Y'a pas de courage à sourire, à vivre et à couvrir ses plaies
Le temps fait qu'endurcir mes peines
J't'ai déjà ouvert mon cœur, j'suis à pas grand chose d'm'ouvrir les veines
Je cherche de quoi nourrir mes rêves
Et le jour où tu partiras, j'pourrai mourir n'importe quand
Sans toi je ferais n'importe quoi des larmes de sueur le cœur volcan
Trouver l'sommeil est un miracle, j'ai le cerveau qui va exploser
J'éloigne le jour où ça se terminera, le jour de la saint Salomé
Un soir où tout était noir, j'ai tout mis sur liste d'attente
Esprit abandonné, fonce-dé aux médicaments
J'ai fais une croix sur mes projets, au final
J'me suis réveillé, condamné à vivre à pleurer à l'hopital
J'm'étais jamais senti aussi mal
Pour une fois j'avais l'impression de vivre
Ma déprime c'est plus que ma musique, c'est pas du cinéma
Paris c'est moi, dans ma tête y'a que des saisons grises

Dans ma chambre d'hôpital, y'a les miens qui crèvent
Oh Salomé si tu savais, c'est pas moi qui vais mal
Encore heureux que je rap, que je pleure des Requiem
Ça prouve que j'suis vivant que j'ai foi en la morale
Dans ma chambre d'hôpital, y'a les miens qui crèvent
Oh Salomé si tu savais, c'est pas moi qui vais mal
Encore heureux que je rap, que je pleure des Requiem
Ça prouve que j'suis vivant que j'ai foi en la morale

Chaque jour, j'ai peur de la mort mais parfois j'aime plus la vie
Parfois j'ai envie de partir mais de pas le choisir
Que Dieu me reprenne près de lui
A trop penser à mourir j'ai l'impression de moisir
Pourtant j'y crois, à l'espoir, à l'amour, à nos coeurs qui battent
A tes pas de danse, combien même que mes pieds les ratent
Pourtant j'y crois à la victoire de l'ombre sur la lumière
A retrouver ma fierté et mon courage jusqu'à ce que mon nom devienne poussière
Je sais qu'c'est trop facile de fuir, d'être bien devant ses potes
Mais comment accepter d'être son pire ennemi
J'pensais être à l'abri mais cet été j'avais l'impression d'étouffer
Et d'être seul, dans ma tête c'était le zbeul
Pourtant j'ai toujours cru aux moments de bonheur
Au bien fait de la cigarette après manger, aux enfants qui pleurent
J'ai toujours cru en la faune et la flore
Surtout le jour où j'ai frôlé la mort

Dans ma chambre d'hôpital, y'a les miens qui crèvent

Georgio,"J'regarde le temps qui file, violent comme une arme blanche
Est-ce que j'ai senti venir cette dépression qui me hante?
Impossible que je l'anticipe, chaque année j'me crois sorti du trou
La tête ailleurs, j'me sens devenir homme
Puis passé l'été c'est pas gagné du tout
Pour moi c'est l'tout début, paraît qu'mes couplets tuent
Un sourire comme première barrière
Au fond j'suis plus complexe qu'une poupée russe
J'ai plus envie d'manger, ni de m'bourrer la gueule
Rien à foutre d'avouer qu'j'suis dépressif et assumer le côté rappeur
L'espoir c'est remplir son cœur de fausses promesses
Tu veux qu'je sois positif? L'anorexique elle joue les top modèles
Le monde y part en couilles c'est pour ça qu'je sors plus d'chez moi
J'ai envie qu'la terre tourne, sans être dans ses plans ni son cinéma
Mes potes peuvent pas comprendre à quel point j'aime me retrouver
(Seul) comme un gosse de 3è qui vient de redoubler
Pourtant, avec eux j'ai parcouru Paris sur toute la nuit
J'ai une vingtaine de frères dans l'coeur
Mais des fois j'disparais des groupes d'amis
C'est comme ça qu'j'me protège
Parce que plus personne me comprend
Entièrement depuis l'collège, mes frères sont sur des échasses
La tête dépasse les nuages de la ruse, et nous
On abuse de nos principes des mirages de la rue

Plus envie d'manger mais faut tenir

Et tu l'sais qu'détester m'voir me mets en danger
Tu peux m'empêcher d'boire, mais pas d'y songer
Te savoir pleurer dans l'noir me donne des raisons d'crever
On m'a offert la vie, j'vais pas la rendre avec une balle dans l'coeur
J'ai pas l'temps d'pleurer, ma musique prend d'l'ampleur
Y'en a combien qu'on m'a chance?
Combien qui s'battent pour l'avoir?
Et moi, non, j'ai jamais fais ça pour la maille
Tu peux pas douter d'mes problèmes
Possible qu'un jour j'écrive des poèmes
Pour l'instant bah j'manque de tendresse solide
Tu peux pas douter d'mon envie d'exister, d'baiser la routine
De manière bestiale, car j'suis devenu son esclave
Des fois j'ai plus d'inspi, j'me sens même pas vivre
Ça m'mets les nerfs à vif, là j'ai trop de trucs à dire car j'ai mis
Plus de patates dans les murs, j'me suis battu dehors

Georgio,"Et maintenant j'chante dans mes putains d'refrains
J'élève la voix et j'pense à tous mes frangins

Changer l'enfoiré devant son miroir est d'plus en plus difficile
Que faire? J'suis sur l'plongeoir, y'a l'succès dans la piscine
Est-ce que j'dois faire le grand pas?
Au risque de m'perdre, de plus aimer ma musique
L'année dernière j'ai vu un frère faire une tentative de suicide
J'ai besoin d'être adouci
Enfermé dans mon petit chez moi, j'ai quitté la rue
Les faux potes, pour les concerts
Avec mes frangins, on est sur la route
On a déchiré les posters qui traînaient dans nos chambres d'ados
Ouais, j'prends d'la hauteur
Mais j'ai peur de la chute, que ça change mon visage
Car faire de la thune modifie l'atterrissage
Ma mère m'a fait comprendre que j'étais un adulte
Rien qu'elle se plaint, qu'elle me parle de factures
C'est dur, j'ai des liens, oui, sensibles aux fractures
J'ai fait du mal, j'compte plus toutes mes bavures
Et toi, tu critiques comme si j'étais au-dessus mais t'es baisé
À nu, j'repense à mes premiers textes
Aux repas mangés dans la souffrance au foyer

Et maintenant j'chante dans mes putains d'refrains
J'élève la voix et j'pense à tous mes frangins
J'vois tout l'monde qui saute en concert
J'vois Sanka qui fait sauter mes sœurs, qui fait sauter mes frères
Portés par la foule, on slam, on s'casse la voix, on est des héros
Et, le lendemain dans l'train, j'repense à chez moi, et tout repart à zéro

Et si j'suis totalement dans l'erreur
Que j'ai pas l'choix, qu'rien s'présente à ma porte
Dis-moi à quoi j'aurais l'cœur
J'suis un bad boy mais j'veux pas affronter l'échec du premier album
Donc j'balance ce rap qui cogne
Tomber dans l'oubli? Non, c'est archi mort
J'donne le maximum, pas envie d'pourrir dans un taxiphone
""Important de savoir d'où l'on vient
Mais surtout pourquoi on s'est barrés""
La devise de Sanka, j'ai mes potes comme boussoles
Rien n'change même si les voyages vont nous séparer
Bien sûr qu'j'ai eu l'choix entre le détail et les biz' honnêtes
Nique le kilo d'herbe
J'préfère écrire mes rêves, étaler des feuilles blanches sur des kilomètres
Mener ma vie honnêtement
Un seul mot d'ordre, rester vrai dans tous mes disques
Faut qu'ma famille puisse adhérer à c'que j'dis
Laisser dans mon ancien survet' mon putain d'tournevis
Ignorer tes commentaires, ta naïveté, ton mépris
Changer l'enfoiré devant son miroir, est-ce encore dans mes cordes?

J'vois tout l'monde qui saute en concert
J'vois Sanka qui fait sauter mes sœurs, qui fait sauter mes frères
Portés par la foule, on slam, on s'casse la voix, on est des héros
Et, le lendemain dans l'train, j'repense à chez moi, et tout repart à zéro

Georgio,"Une route, un destin, une envie, un chemin
Un rêve, un voyage, un regard vers le large
J'attends si peu des autres, j'ai déjà déçu les miens
J'attends beaucoup d'l'amour, mais beaucoup restent en chien
J'en ai trop vu s'planter, faire des croix sur le futur
Et accepter qu'on puisse rien faire pour les sauver, c'est le plus dur
Réaction égoïste, ma tête de terroriste
Quitte à partir, faîtes-moi mourir de rire
Y'a rien d'pire que la honte qui te hante
Quand tu entends un rire, comme un couteau qu'on te plante
Tu repenses à avant, avant les coups de poing dans le ventre
Car aujourd'hui c'est pas rien d'respirer, mon air sent les regrets
Le beau temps, les envies, ils m'ont tous esquivé
Ils m'ont tous esquivé, j'aimerais prier la vie, d'un jour sans t'punir
Ou pourquoi pas dire au revoir et m'enfuir, ou la revoir et puis m'enfuir

Ni l'alcool, ni les drogues masqueront mon ciel noir
Mon sourire bâtard, mon envie du néant
S'étend sur mes jeudis gris, qui crie sans espoir
Il n'y a plus de voix, que des bruits, plus de moi

Ni l'alcool, ni les drogues masqueront mon ciel noir
Mon sourire bâtard, mon envie du néant
S'étend sur mes jeudis gris, qui crie sans espoir
Il n'y a plus de voix, que des bruits, plus de moi

Les yeux pleins de sang, je recherche mon chemin d'croix
Combien ne croient plus en l'amour après l'avoir trouvé plein d'fois?
Faut tout l'temps faire semblant que mes nuits ne sont pas si cruelles
Accepter que l'monde tourne ailleurs qu'autour de moi
J'ai autant peur du temps que
J'ai peur de moi, justement, j'm'épuise à travers les yeux
Les yeux d'un jugement de quelqu'un qui n'sait rien
J'ai perdu ma routine, il y a plus de doutes j'suis pas dans l'bon train
Sur les mauvais rails, rail de coke, à demain
Et demain c'est maintenant, j'pleure l'amour à jamais
Car jamais c'est souvent, et souvent c'est la routine
Les déceptions, un gros cul dans la cuisine
Tu passes ton temps à subir
Mais autant être deux, quitte à subir
Il y a tellement de choses que je ne contrôle pas
Marre de la dépression, d'mes problèmes de bourgeois

Ni l'alcool, ni les drogues masqueront mon ciel noir
Mon sourire bâtard, mon envie du néant
S'étend sur mes jeudis gris, qui crie sans espoir
Il n'y a plus de voix, que des bruits, plus de moi

Ni l'alcool, ni les drogues masqueront mon ciel noir
Mon sourire bâtard, mon envie du néant
S'étend sur mes jeudis gris, qui crie sans espoir
Il n'y a plus de voix, que des bruits, plus de moi

La solitude fait écho à mon propre moi
Quand la terre me mets hors de moi
Quand je chante, je suis hors-la-loi
Je me livre, quand d'habitude je n'essaie même pas
Faut tout l'temps faire semblant que j'ai des montagnes de rien
Que mes problèmes vont se résoudre, des tiens
Que la vie te rajoute des problèmes
Des montagnes à gravir, sans lune, ni soleil
Mes nuits c'est les tourments, mes rayons c'est des doutes
La vie est sanglante, elle m'épuise tant, elle me coûte
Des fusées dans la tête, et mon cœur en vitrine
Des soucis qui m'tabassent, du bonheur je me vide
J'ai reconnu à mon âme qu'on était peu sincères
Que vivre dans l'apparence, c'était beaucoup d'galères
C'était beaucoup d'galères",Jeudi gris
Georgio,"Chaque coin de rue ça pue l'amertume
Ça vend la verdure, crois pas que l'amour a perduré
On pense qu'à faire du blé, avec la tête dure
On a tous fait nos preuves dans des quartiers sombres
On y passe les 4 saisons, ils ont fait des conneries
On a goumé nos reufs, faut pas que petit frère fume et boive
Rêve de salopes, insulte les femmes
En deux trois fréquentations, devienne le pire ennemi de l'état
Combien ont géré des fours? La juge tu la vois
Quand tes bâtiments t'ont joué des tours
Je sais que la galère ça pousse au vice, qu'on sera plus intelligents
Entre les cours et la rue, on est de vrais couteaux Suisses
J'ai trop entendu ces paroles, dans des halls avec les vitres pétées
Demande à C.Sen, je craque et je me répète comme un disque rayé
Traîner avec les même gars, parler de tout, de rien
Reporter les objectifs de la veille et dire qu'on gérera tout demain
Serrer les mêmes mains, croiser les même regards des reufrés qui descendent
Avec une barrette de 10 ou une canette de tise
Des packs de bière après la salle de sport
Des grecs à emporter, putain de quartier à tête de mort
Y'a le poto qu'on voit plus trop, sur son dos y'a des rumeurs
Des clans qui se forment, ça pue la pisse
Sur le banc, des gens qui dorment
Tu vois ton ex du collège, elle pense que t'as pas changé
Que t'es encore la proie de la BAC
Et tu la vois monter dans un BM d'un mec costard-cravatte
Ça vanne dans tous les sens, dire qu'elle t'avait fait cocu
Que t'avais pété les plombs, qu'y'avais traité sa mère d'grosse pute
Tu sors de 48 heures de gardav' c'est pas grave, hein
T'as jamais eu peur du placard, ni des bagarres, c'est ta life hein
Ça ressort tête haute, sans donner de nom
Au tieqs on a tous des blazes, sauf toi
Pareil, y'a rien qui te correspond
Ça rentre dormir quand nos mères se lèvent, faut cacher les yeux rouges
Complètement bourré, t'as réveillé ta soeur qui t'as dit ""mais t'es chelou""
Aucun frérot sur Facebook, aucune photo à voir
Hier t'as mis celle de ton père, mais tu veux juste entendre sa voix
Tu connaissais tous les papas qui partent et les baratineurs
Mais pas la souffrance d'un fils quand c'est le papa qui meurt
Le frigo vide, les lettres de pôle emploi, les demandes d'APL
Aucun moyen de trouver le sommeil, tu veux juste être bourré d'oseille
Malheureusement c'est pas le cas, ça pense aux flingues, aux braquages
A venger cette putain d'enfance dont tu parles pas
Y'a du shit, plus de cigarettes, l'épicier a fermé, c'est die
T'es en galère, pourtant dans des biz de cartouches d'Espagne

Et impossible de trouver le sommeil
Alors tu fais des pompes, des tractions, des abdos
Impossible de trouver le sommeil
Alors tu zones sur Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
Impossible de trouver le sommeil
Tu regardes un film, t'arrives au générique
Impossible de trouver le sommeil
Et au moment où tu t'y attends le moins, il t'tombe dessus
Et le lendemain mon frère, t'es reparti, ouais le l'lendemain

Ça dépose des CV mais t'espères même plus qu'on te rappelles
Tu le fais pour ta conscience et puis éviter des galères
Avoir un peu de biff, bouger dans des rées-soi qui vendent du rêve
Pas l'choix, se détruire, se consumer
Ne plus apercevoir le temps qui passe
Étouffé dans la routine des week-ends
Rien que ça pause à baiser des fliquettes
Le vendredi tu vois des soss' partir à la Mosquée
Toi t'es de famille athée, comment y croire? On est si peu gâtés
On a grandi sans rien, on a perdu nos valeurs
Putain de vie d'chien, mentir sur Twitter, dormir jusqu'à 16 heures
Fini l'époque de La Haine, vendre des barrettes c'est de la merde
D'ailleurs on les a vu vendre la poisse, mais pas les regrets qui s'amènent
Des coups d'schlass, histoires de terrain, de meufs, de petits frères
Le quartier nous a soudés, on se le dira une fois au cimetière
Bouffés par les doutes, les problèmes d'apparence, les coups au cœur
Les mecs qui transpirent la jalousie pour des pompes à Foot Locker
Croiser les anciens chez le coiffeur, le fils des voisins à la Poste
Puis apprendre par son meilleur pote
Qu'aujourd'hui il est comme moi, ouais il est devenu rappeur

C'est pour les anges déchus, c'est pour les gens déçus
Ouais, ouais, chaque coin de rue ça pue l'amertume
Ça vend la verdure, crois pas que l'amour a perduré
On pense qu'à faire du blé avec le tête dure

Demain c'est loin, demain c'est mort, demain c'est affreux
Parce que j'ai des potes sur le terrain que la juge met hors-jeu
Demain c'est loin, demain c'est mort, demain c'est affreux
Parce que j'ai des potes sur le terrain que la juge met hors-jeu","Les anges déchus, les gens déçus"
Georgio,"J'crois qu'on avait 16 ans à tout péter
J'm'en rappelle il pleuvait, pourtant c'était un jour d'été
On était quoi? Quatre-cinq reufs? Pas plus hein?
Oui c'est ça, et le zinc de Malik venait d'avoir une BM neuve
Rien qu'il faisait crier les pneus, pleurer les freins
Montait à cent en quelques secondes
On était fous à cette époque, on était tous en quête d'euros
Tous chez moi, lendemain d'soirée zappé
Ça puait l'vomi sur mes draps
J'rangeais l'appart, j'appréhende c'moment où Papa reviendra
Une fois fini, comme une récompense
La pluie s'arrête, on descend tous
Pour quoi faire? J'sais plus on est dans l'flou
Autant profiter du beau temps après la tempête
Quitte à se vanner, autant l'faire dehors sous un arc en ciel
Et là l'cousin de Malik descend d'sa BM
Et nous raconte de belles histoires
Monopolise la parole, d'une manière interminable
Malik lui demande les clés, la suite j'm'en rappelle pas
J'me souviens de nos yeux étonnés quand il accepta

Malik, je repense à Malik
Malik, te rappelles-tu de Malik?
Malik, je repense à Malik
Malik, te rappelles-tu de Malik?

Malik courait avec les clés, et les plus vifs couraient après
Mais l'cousin a dit ""Personne monte moi j'veux pas d'soucis ah ouais""
On entendait la BM un peu partout
Il avait pas menti, c'était un vrai pilote
Accélérait, grillait des feux, nous on criait, on était fous
Malik écrasait les pédales, comme pour fuir son père ivrogne
Conduire sans permis quelle sensation
Il avait l'impression d'être libre, d'emmerder l'monde
Faisait gronder le moteur pour plaire aux filles
Fallait ramener la caisse
Suivi par les flics, il commence à flipper
Il loupe un stop, puis écrase un gosse devant le centre aéré

Malik, je repense à Malik
Malik, te rappelles-tu de Malik?
Malik, je repense à Malik
Malik, te rappelles-tu de Malik?

Par peur Malik s'arrête pas, au contraire accélère
Entend les mères crier, quel merdier, que faire?
Faut réfléchir et vite, dix mille questions dans sa tête
""Est-ce que le petit est mort? Va-t-il prendre cher?
Doit-il s'arrêter et reconnaître ses torts?""
Le cerveau contre l'appuie-tête, il tente d'échapper aux flics
Prends trop de risques, même pour un as de la vitesse
Pour éviter une caisse, Malik monte sur un trottoir
Finit dans une cabine téléphonique, sors d'la BM et c'est trop tard

Il voulait juste une balade dans un carrosse
Finira au placard avec les menottes
Et aujourd'hui, tous ses potes sont des fantômes
Pendant qu'la mère du môme meurt chaque jour dans ses sanglots
Il voulait juste une balade dans un carrosse

Georgio,"C'est pour les rêveurs incarcérés dans des prisons réelles
Un tacle avec les deux pieds si nous dessinons nos peines
Se livrer à son petit frère, c'est une décision mortelle
Parler de rêves, de brûlures, d'un petit con qu'on ensorcelle
Ouais j'te jure qu'il m'comprend, lui qui veut vivre de sa passion
Il a vu ses potes détruire des projets, Anatole a quitté la maison
Créant son propre Odyssée, a vu ses potes du lycée
Créant leur propre hécatombe, dans les roues, des bâtons
Je l'ai vu sécher les cours, je lui ai dit fait pas l'con, morale classique
Juste pour l'honneur et pour la mama, imagine la fierté
D'avoir un fils dans les études, en même temps grand footballeur
Un jour il m'racontera peut-être tous ses problèmes de cœur
Je lui dirai : ""n'écoute pas ta tête, sans ta belle-sœur je meurs""
En vrai t'as pas l'choix, ignore pas toutes les raisons
Si facile de faire une croix sur son propre horizon

Et si tu tombes, tombes, tombes
N'aie pas peur de te relever
Ouvre tes paupières, inévitables

Et si tu tombes, tombes, tombes
N'aie pas peur de te relever
Ouvre tes paupières, inévitables

Ou comme mon frère, qui subissent tous les soucis d'leur père
Même s'il t'a caché plein d'choses
Pour qu'tu nages jusqu'à l'estuaire
En pensant qu't'avais pied, sachant qu't'avais peur
Sur l'banc d'touche pas facile, tu vois l'match s'éterniser
Je sais qu't'en dors pas, soucis du rêveur brisé
Je sais qu't'as l'mental, que t'es meilleur chaque journée
On changera d'club sans galère, la saison terminée
La vie c'est quelques problèmes pour des milliards d'solutions
Beaucoup d'courage, un peu d'haine, cocktail en ébullition
Et mon frère oublie pas que chaque effort ça paie
Je lui répéterai tant qu'il faudra : faut rester fort et sincère

Et si tu tombes, tombes, tombes
N'aie pas peur de te relever
Ouvre tes paupières, inévitables
Les rêves sont fait pour être réalisés
Et si tu tombes, tombes, tombes
N'aie pas peur de te relever
Ouvre tes paupières, inévitables
Les rêves sont fait pour être réalisés

C'est pour les rêveurs endormis dans des journées sans fin
Qui connaissent le goût d'la vie et les règles qu'on enfreint
La nuit porte conseil, règle des dilemmes sans lendemain
Un chant de stade aux allures de requiem sans chagrin
C'est c'que j'imagine quand j'vis ta vie dans mes lunes
J'crois pas être dans l'erreur, en tout cas j'évite d'en être une
C'est tellement dur de lire à travers tes écorces
Fruit du même amour, qui comme beaucoup, a fini en divorce

C'est pour les rêveurs dans l'coma sur la civière
Qui pleurent des larmes à la sueur de leur carrière
C'est pour mon frère, un contrôle, une passe déc'
Quatre-vingt dix minutes et puis on s'arrête

Et si tu tombes, tombes, tombes
N'aie pas peur de te relever
Ouvre tes paupières, inévitables
Les rêves sont fait pour être réalisés
Et si tu tombes, tombes, tombes
N'aie pas peur de te relever
Ouvre tes paupières, inévitables
Les rêves sont fait pour être réalisés

J'voulais juste vous dire entr tous ces concerts
Ces courts moments de bonheur intense
Que quand je rentre chez moi la vie reprend avec ses milliards de soucis
Puis les miens ne sont pas forcément à l'abri
Moi non plus d'ailleurs
Alors donnons nous la force d'aller loin et de garder la tête sur les épaules
J'refuse d'être traité comme une merde pour un salaire de merde
Je refuse de perdre mon amour sous prétexte que c'est la vie
Qu'on peut rien y faire
Je refuse de croire que ma passion doit forcément rester un loisir
Et que je peux pas en vivre
La vie c'est ça et ça, pas ça ou ça
Force

Bleu Noir, c'est la couleur du son que j'aime
Ça m'représente, c'est le coucher de soleil d'un jour où il fait pas forcément chaud

Je me casse, je laisse Paname dans le flou
Une fois la Tour Eiffel derrière moi, j'avoue
J'ai commencé à douter, Paris on se retrouvera sans doute
Personne a pris ma foi, alors je brise les codes à vive allure
Je pisse droit, mes voyages jamais soumis à vos dictatures
Mes nuages sont indolores depuis que je sais où je vais
Puisque la vie vaut de l'or, expliquez-moi le sang dans les CJD
J'ai l'impression que là où je respire, d'autres meurent étouffés
J'ignore où se trouve le cimetière de la jeunesse
Et miroir, excuse-toi de me créer des chaînes

Je rejoins mes potes qui sortent de boîte
La gueule de bois, et dans les premiers bus, tout le monde le remarque
On est différents, on parle fort, rien de bien méchant
Aller taffer, plus jamais, j'ai de l’empathie pour les gens
Qui ont pas eu le courage ou le choix que de se lever
Toute leur vie pour pas grand-chose
L'éducation, l'ouverture d'esprit rend nos parents pauvres
Il faut le comprendre et je crois que seul le temps nous le permet
On perd le notre sur internet, des trous dans la cervelle
Faire semblant d'avoir pas peur la diminue, on fait tous pareil
Puisqu'on doute toute l'année, mon sourire ferait croire que je souffre à peine
Alors que j'étais condamné à me planter les intestins

Le notaire de  Saint Malo
Voudrait bien marier sa fille
Mais elle est sourde comme un pot
A part ça elle est gentille
Il l’a fait venir à Paris
Dans un tas d’soirées mondaines
Ell’ n’a pu trouver de marie
Le notaire a de la peine
D’autant plus qu’derrière un rideau
Il entendit certain tantôt
Une bande de gigolos
Parler de sa fille en ces mots :
Elle sent bon le chèvrefeuille
Tout ça c’est bien, fort bien, très bien
Hélas elle est dur’ de la feuille
Ell’ n’entend rien mais rien de rien
Si ses toilettes la distinguent
Et que l’on désire lui faire un compliment
Faut gueuler … car elle est sourdingue
Et l’on s’enroue immédiat’ment
Faut gueuler…car elle est sourdingue
Et l’on s’enroue immédiat’ment

Le notaire de Saint Malo
A vu des docteurs célèbres
L’un d’entre eux, un vrai rigolo
Lui a dit : « dans les ténèbres
Tirez un coup de feu en l’air
Pour y ouvrir la tromp’ d’eustache »
Le soir muni d’son revolver
Dans sa chambrette il se cache
Il tir’ trois ball’s dans le plafond
I a cassé la suspension
Fendu la glac’ du grand salon :
Elle a fait dans son pantalon !
Elle sent bon le chèvrefeuille
Tout ça c’est bien, fort bien, très bien
Mais elle est toujours dur’ de la feuille
Ell’ n’entend rien mais rien de rien
Elle est devenu’ très malingre
Elle a de l’entérit’ de puis cet accident
Et comm’ elle est toujours sourdingue
Ça donn’ quelque chos’ de charmant
Et comme elle est toujours sourdingue
Ça donn’ quelque chos’ de charmant

Elle a trouvé, c’n’est pas trop tôt
Un mari de complaisance
Un jeune homm’ qui n’est pas très beau
Et muet depuis sa naissance
Il ne lui dit jamais un mot
Ell’ n’répond pas un’ parole
Ça donn’ de très jolis tableaux
L’soir au lit, c’est croquignole !
Ell’ n’entend rien mais rien du tout
Quand il remplit ses d’voirs d’époux
Mais s’il est muet… il n’est pas mou
Ell’ se réveill’ mère à chaque coup !
Elle a douz’ goss’s sans qu’ell’ le veuille
Tous les douz’ crient comm’ des putois
Car ils sont tous dur de la feuille
Et ils parlent tous à la fois
Quand l’pèr’ se fâch’ ça le distingue
Il ouvre la bouch’ mais il n’en sort que du vent

Ça donn’ quelque chos’ de marrant.

Leaves on branches, for your pleasure, perform a soothing dance

Little girl it seems in all my dreams your happiness is due
But still they last there in your past, events that make you blue

Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try, oh, oh

Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try

Gerald Albright,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Gerald Albright,"Like a lover, the morning sun
Slowly rises and kisses you awake
Your smile so soft and drowsy
As you let it play upon your face

Oh, how I dream
I could be like the morning sun to you

Like a lover, the river wind
Slides and ripples its finger through your hair
Upon your cheek, it lingers
Never having known a sweeter place

Oh, how I dream
I could be like the river wind to you

How I envy your cup that knows your lips
Let it be me, my love
And a table that feels your fingertips
Let it be me, let me be your love

Bring it into the endless days and nights
Without you

Like a lover, the velvet moon
Shares your pillow and watches while you sleep
Its light arrives on tiptoe
Gently taking you in its embrace

Oh, how I dream
I could be like the velvet moon to you

I could be like the morning sun
I could be like a lover to you

",Like a Lover
Gerald Albright,"The look of love
Is in your eyes

Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

And I won't put up a fight
No, you left me all alone

Gerald Alston,"I'm ridin' high on the freeway late at night
I got some trouble on my mind 'cause my shit ain't right
I'm comin' short on the real money, a nigga broke
I need a fifth of Remmie Martin and some weed to smoke
It ain't no joke when you're comin' from the town I'm from
Most nigs be dead before 21
I'm tryin' hard just to maintain, I fry my brain
Nigga losin' his mind, slowly goin' insane
And niggaz think I got it all, I was born to ball
Eyes bloodshot red from that alcohol
I watched the rise and the fall of all my homies who ball
My dogs brains blew out blood stained the wall
Suckas wish I was dead, didn't live to tell
The way a hot slug feel, and fried skin smell
Niggaz want me dead out here playa hatin'
'Cause they bitches want to molest, they masturbatin'
I can't help, that's the way it is, handle yo business
And make sure you ain't no eye witness
Keep your eyes on your money boy, at all times
Most people don't know you gotta take it slow in the sunshine

(CHORUS)(2x)
Another day, another way
Sometimes you gotta take it in
Slow motion, in slow motion

Gotta take it slow, can't go to fast
If I blast for cash, might not see the green grass
At last, make it all green like mash
Take your cash, then I dash, picture this with the flash
Robotic, economic, knowin' nothin' but ebonics
Still hooked on chronic, plus I'm black like Onyx
Can you see me with a telescope
Or do you need the dopeman to tell you that it's dope
I hope you know the difference between
Life or death and bein' woke from a dream
So many schemes it's hard to see between the seems
When the system redeems, bustin' infrared beams
From here to New Orleans plenty of dope fiends
That's why I keep a car clean, and fulla gasoline
Know what I mean, young nigga workin' for beans
Still chasin' your dreams

I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do

I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry

I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you

Mon ego & moi, nous somme très fiers
De ne jamais dormir seuls,
Dormir seuls

Johnny & Joe sont en ville
Mon arme me sera bien utile
Car Joe n'est plus très docile
Depuis que madame a élu domicile,
Chez moi

Pour cette très charmante personne
Demain je me lèverai tôt
Son mari et son frère sont deux hommes
Que je n'aime pas avoir dans le dos
Si parfois ma conscience me questionne
J'irai quand même leur faire la peau
Je sais c'est dur mais Dieu me pardonne
Je n'aime pas dormir seul,

Au dessus de l'océan, dans un état fébrile

Avec les mortels, et loin de ceux qui me traquent
Je plonge vers elle

Si jamais je me noie
Si par hasard je prends goût à ça

N'est jamais facile
Et souvent mon sang se glace
Devant les murs de la ville
Mon état est fébrile

Gérald De Palmas,"Je ne joue plus dans la cour
La cloche a sonné mais je suis sourd
Assis sous un arbre sans bouger
Je la regarde sans respirer... sans respirer

Je veux qu'elle m'aime
Je veux qu'elle m'aime

Quand elle s'approche trop près de moi
J'ai tendance à perdre mon sang froid
A huit ans comment lui expliquer
Que je ne joue plus, c'est pour de vrai... c'est pour de vrai

Je veux qu'elle m'aime
Je veux qu'elle m'aime

Demain je l'ai invitée
A quoi on va bien pouvoir jouer
Les filles ça n'aime pas le football
Il serait temps que je m'affole 

Je veux qu'elle m'aime
Je veux qu'elle m'aime

Quand je serai grand on se mariera
Et je l'aimerai toujours comme ça
Pour qu'il ne lui vienne jamais l'idée
De vouloir un jour me divorcer

Gérald De Palmas,"Cette nuit je me suis perdu
Dans un lieu étrange et inconnu
Je me sentais si libre
L'esprit et le corps en équilibre

Je n'ai peur de...
Rien dans mon rêve
Tout va tellement bien dans mon rêve
Dans mon rêve

Je ne doutais plus de tes sentiments
Je n'm'inquiétais plus pour les enfants
On laissait tout ouvert
On partait faire le tour de la terre

Je n'ai peur de...
Rien dans mon rêve
Tout va tellement bien dans mon rêve
Dans mon rêve

Le retour sur terre est de plus en plus douloureux
La peur m'a rendu fou
Si je ne vois pas d'amour dans tes yeux
Alors je perdrai tout

Gérald De Palmas,"Perdu seul à l'autre bout du monde
Je tue le temps seconde après seconde
Je n'attends rien du hasard
Je sais qu'elle vient ici tous les soirs

Elle danse seule
Ephémère et légère
J'oublie tout, mon passé, mes misères
Elle danse seule, seule

Et je trime toute la journée
Oui je trime pour ne pas penser
J'ai quitté les miens depuis si longtemps
Quand la nuit vient, je m'enivre et j'attends

Super belle et toujours en forme 
Une de celles que l'on voudrait 
Pour la vie à ses côtés 
Je la croise tous les matins 
Quand elle passe seule avec son chien 
Si il pleut, qu'elle rentre plus tôt 
Je fais du feu et je fais le beau 

refrain: 
Elle habite ici

Je flânais, guéri de tout mes maux
C'est assez rare pour que je le précise
D'habitude j'ai le moral à zéro
Au détour d'une ruelle sans nom
Te voilà, une chance sur un million

Rien n'y fait, je n'ai pas oublié
Rien n'y fait, tu n'as pas changé
Rien n'y fait, dans tes yeux, 
je meurs encore une fois,

Acheter une voiture, avoir des enfants
Partir en vacances avec le sourire
Avoir des projets pour l'avenir

Un jour il la trompera sans discrétion
Elle se consolera avec ses enfants
Elle ne lui posera jamais de questions
Et tout redeviendra comme avant

Là où je suis né
Peu à peu mon coeur a enfui ce qui fait mon passé
Difficile de vivre le présent sans avant sans après
Alors j'avance au hasard d'un pas mal assuré

Je suis un homme sans racines
Au moindre vent je m'incline
Juste un homme sans racines
Je pense à demain et j'imagine

Parfois des visages me reviennent mais je préfère tirer un trait
Sur ce mélange de bons souvenirs mais aussi de mauvais
J'aimerai trouver un endroit où me reccueillir
Un endroit où puiser la force, la force de m'affranchir

Je suis un homme sans racines
Au moindre vent je m'incline
Juste un homme sans racines
Je pense à demain et j'imagine

Au moment opportun
Je tuerai mes démons un par un
Fort et serein je ne serai plus...

Et vivre ensemble enfin heureux à deux

Sans arrêt à longueur de journée? 

Tu as gagné ta place au paradis 
Et si un ange passe, pars avec lui 
Tu as gagné ta place au paradis

Le calvaire que tu dois endurer

Un être à part

On s'amuse, on me plaint
Rien de tout ça ne m'atteint
