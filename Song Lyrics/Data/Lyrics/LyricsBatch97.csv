Eric Carmen,"A lot of empty words that I've already heard
Ain't gonna work tonight
Don't want to talk about it anymore
'Cause that ain't gonna make things right
So now you're back again; you say it's not too late
To give it one more try
Well, I don't want to hear your lies
No, I don't want to hear your lies no more
I've got to find a way, I know, to let you go
'Cause it hurts too much
You say you'll never leave
And then you're gone again
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much, my love
I've heard it all before
I've got to tell you no, no, no
It hurts too much
You know I tried so hard
I spend so many nights
Waitin' for the phone to ring
But it's over now, and I'm afraid
I don't feel much of anything
You say you want my love
You've played around enough
But now I can't forget
Well, honey, there's nothing left
I ain't got nothin' left at all
I've got to find a way, I know, to let you go
'Cause it hurts too much
You say you'll never leave
And then you're gone again
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much, my love
I've heard it all before
I've got to tell you no, no, no
It hurts too much
Just when I thought I'd gotten over you
I hear you knockin' at my door
After everything you've put me through, you know
I just can't take it anymore
You say you want my love
You've played around enough
But now I can't forget
Well, honey, there's nothing left
I ain't got nothin' left at all
I've got to find a...
To find a way, I know, to let you go
'Cause it hurts too much
You say you'll never leave
And then you're gone again
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much, my love
I've heard it all before
I've got to tell you no, no, no
It hurts too much
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much
Oh, it hurts too much
Listen when I tell you it hurts
Oh, it hurts too much
Oh, mama, it hurts
Oh, you hurt me so much",It Hurts Too Much
Eric Carmen,"I run a comb through my hair and step out in the street
And the city's the color of flame in the mid-summer heat, oh yeah
Jennifer's got her daddy's car, she's playing ""Uptown"" on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close, the way they did long ago

My darlin'

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
(Keep) Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baby, baby
(When) When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) Take me over the edge
Make me lose control

We put the top down and park with the moon in the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair, like a fire in July, oh yeah
Jennifer's singin' ""Stand by Me"" and she knows every single word by heart
Was love always this good, or could this be just the start?

Oh darlin'

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
(Keep) Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baby, baby
(When) When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) Take me over the edge
Make me lose control

Keep my baby clothes on, and were movin' in time
And the heat from your touch, makes me feel like I'm losing my mind, oh yeah
(And then they played) Back in my arms again 
(We close our eyes) We start rememberin' when
(We start to kiss) And all the feelings return
And we just pray that this night never ends

Oh, my darlin'
(Turn) Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive make me lose control
Baby
When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) Take me over the edge
Make me lose control

Baby, baby

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
(Keep) Keep this feelin' alive make me lose control

When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) Take me over the edge make me lose control

Baby, baby 

Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
(Keep) Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control",Make Me Lose Control
Eric Carmen,"No use pretending things can still be right
There's really nothing more to say
I'll get along without your kiss tonight
Just close the door and walk away

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
‘Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you
No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

At first we thought that love was here to stay
The summer made it seem so right
But like the sun we watched it fade away
From morning into lonely night",Never Gonna Fall in Love Again
Eric Carmen,"We was young
And still believed in a Hard Day's Night
But no one seemed to understand
That there was no relief in sight
The company man
He's got his nose glued to the charts
He says the record's doin' fine
But now the group is fallin' apart

I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause there isn't anyone to blame
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause nothin' ever stays the same
Well we was locked in image prison
Waitin' for that break
We was raped, reshaped and tryin' to escape
Caught in a rock and roll time warp
Just tryin' to find the way to get out

Four years on
And things were really gettin' too intense
Critics ravin' 'bout our album
But we're makin' fifty cents
And in the end
We was facin' the hard, cold truth
So tomorrow come what may
Looks like it's Ricky and The Tooth

I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause there isn't anyone to blame
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause nothin' ever stays the same
Well we was locked in image prison
Waitin' for that break
We was raped, reshaped and tryin' to escape
Caught in a rock and roll time warp
Just tryin' to find the way to get out

We gave it everything we had to give
But it was gettin' so tough
Too much frustration makes it hard to live
I think enough is enough
I said enough is enough

I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause there isn't anyone to blame
I hope there's no hard feelings
'Cause nothin' ever stay the same
While we was locked in image prison
Waitin' for that break
We was raped, reshaped and tryin' to escape
Caught in a rock and roll time warp
Just tryin' to fine the way to get out

Lemme out, lemme out
Lemme out, lemme out
I gotta get out
Lemme out, lemme out
I gotta gotta gotta get out
Lemme out
I gotta get out
Lemme out, lemme out, lemme out
Lemme out

Eric Carmen,"I set to sea on a ship called Emptiness
Cast away on the island of Loneliness
Lookin' for love, oh and I was lookin' for love
I didn't think she could hear my S.O.S.
But she appeared like an angel of tenderness
Sent from above, oh and she was bringing me love.

Oh mama, she did it
Woh momma, she did it, yeah, etc.

Looking back, making love was meaningless
'Till she touched me with her warmth
And a gentless I'd never known
Ooh, and she was guidin' me home
Now I see all the things in life I missed
'Till she opened up my eyes to the limitless
Wonder of love, oh and now I'm ready for love.

I never new what love was about
'Till she came and stole away my heart.
Now I'm alive and I know it
And all I ever want to do is show it.
Ooh...",She Did It
Eric Carmen,"Well I was sixteen
And sick of school
I didn't know what I wanted to do
I bought a guitar
I got the fever
That's rock'n roll

I played at parties
Played in bars
I spent my money buyin' new guitars
I screamed my heart out
But how I loved it
That's rock'n roll

Well, come on everybody
Get down and get with it
Come on everybody
Get down and get with it
Come on everybody
Get down, that's rock'n roll

It's when the smokin'
And the heat
Have got your heart pounding right with
The beat
Don't try to fight it
Just get excited
That's rock'n roll

Well it's the roadies
And the crowd
It's when the band's playin' way too loud
Your hips are shakin'
Ain't no mistakin'
That's rock'n roll

Well, come on everybody
Get down and get with it
Come on everybody
Get down and get with it
Come on everybody
Get down, that's rock'n roll

Now don't you worry
'Bout bein' a star
It doesn't matter who or what you are
Just get the rhythm
And let it fill ya
That's rock'n roll

And if you feel it
Clap your hands
Let's see some sweat for the boys in the band
Now lemme hear ya
Lemme hear ya

Come on everybody

Eric Carmen,"I've been up too high
I've been down too low
I've been searchin' for somethin'
With nowhere to go
Thought I'd make it alone
But I'm so far from home
In a town full of desperate fools

Oh, the sun beats down
On the L.A. scene
But you can't feel the cold
When the grass looks so green
And the games that I've played
Were not worth what I paid
In a town full of desperate fools

I've been takin' my life
One day at a time
Tryin' to piece it all together
But I know in my mind
That I'm startin' to be
What they want me to be
And I wonder sometimes
What's becoming of me

I've been takin' my life

What's becoming of me

'Cause I've been up too high
I've been down too low
I've been searchin' for somethin'
With nowhere to go
And I suppose it's been fun
But I guess I'm just one
In a town full of desperate fools
A town full of desperate fools",Desperate Fools
Eric Carmen,"Well I know it sounds funny
But I'm not in it for the money, no
I don't need no reputation
And I'm not in it for the show

I just want a hit record, yeah
Wanna hear it on the radio
Want a big hit record, yeah
One that everybody's got to know

Well if the program director don't pull it
It's time to get back the bullet
So bring the group down to the station
You're gonna be an overnight sensation

I've been tryin' to write the lyric
Non-offensive but satiric too
And if you put it in the A-slot
It's just got to make a mint for you

I fit those words to a good melody
Amazing how success has been ignoring me
So long
I use my bread making demos all day
Writing in the night while in my head I hear
The record play
Hear it play

Hit record, yeah
Wanna hit record, yeah
Wanna hit record, yeah (number one)",Overnight Sensation (Hit Record)

Eric Carmen,"We used to laugh
We used to cry
We used to talk about forever you and I
And love was all we seemed to need
I still recall sometimes
The way we used to be

When did we change?
Where has love gone?
We can't explain it
But we know there's something wrong
And all that's left of you and me
Is just a memory of
The way we used to be

I can remember when
We used to be the best of friends
Now, suddenly, we don't know what to say
If there's a chance that we
Can bring the feeling back again
I've got to try
Why don't you stay?

'Cause in my heart
I think you know
I tried to hide it, but I just can't let you go
It's not too late
For you and me
To be in love again

It's not too late
For you and me
To be in love again

Eric Carmen,"I thought that dreams belonged to other men
'cause each time i got close
They'd fall apart again

I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
I faced the nights alone
Oh, how could i have known
That all my life i only needed you?

Whoa
Almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that i can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

It seems like perfect love's so hard to find
I'd almost given up
You must have read my mind

And all these dreams i saved for a rainy day
They're finally coming true
I'll share them all with you
'cause now we hold the future in our hands

Whoa
Almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door

How could we ask for more?
I swear that i can see forever in your eyes

It's getting closer
Closer every day

I like the colors
I like the way they move
They're all so brilliantly realized
They just could not be improved

I love the way the sex is so overt
I love the way the violence doesn't hurt

It's a cartoon world
It's exactly as it seems
And it's bigger than life
And better than all your dreams

It's a cartoon world
It's a safer place to be
And it's better than real
A perfect facsimile
It's a cartoon world

I like the things their saying
I like the way they're said
I like to change the channels
While I'm lying in my bed

From the commercial to the anchorman
They've done research on my attention span

It's a cartoon world
It's exactly as it seems
And it's smaller than life
And better than all your dreams

It's a cartoon world
It's a safer place to be
And it's better than real
And bigger than you and me

And the stars are brighter
They've got more charisma
And more style than you and me

I watch the news on tv
It doesn't mean a thing to me
What's a little ethnic cleansing?
That's the way it's always been

I was excited when the war began
Now I've got Game Boy, I'm a happy man

It's a cartoon world
It's exactly as it seems
And it's bigger than life
And better than all your dreams

It's a cartoon world
It's a safer place to be
And it's better than real
A perfect facsimile
It's a cartoon world

It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world

It's a cartoon world

Is that perfume in the air?
Seems the moon has got control of me
And I don't really care
With our bodies gently swaying
To the rhythm of the night
Has there ever been a place or time
That ever felt so right

Oh, I've dreamed about this moment
Ever since I saw your face
Now I never want to let it slip away
Isn't it romantic
How our kisses seem to set the night on fire?
Baby, when I look at you it takes my breath away
Isn't it romantic
When we close our eyes and hold each other tight?
If only love could always be this way

There's a samba playing somewhere
Or is it just my beating heart?
I can swear I hear the strumming of
A classical guitar
Playing softly while you whisper
All the words I've longed to hear
As I pull your body close to mine
The world just disappears
Oh, I dreamed about this moment
Ever since I saw your face

Now I never want to let it slip away

And the sun is in my eyes
Temperature is rising
It's so hot

Shake it up
I go racing through the streets
Howling in the heat
And you know why

Girls in cars are driving through the city
Breaking hearts, but looking awful pretty
Baby, not so fast
Make the summer last

Top down summer
Are you ready for love?
Top down summer
We can drive to forever tonight
Hey baby, the right time's finally here
The top down time of the year

Take your Mustang off the blocks
Ain't nobody walks when it's so hot

Me and you
We can ride to town in style
Flash 'em all a smile
And you know what

I'm so high whenever we're together
I wish we could feel this way forever
Love is weatherproof
C'mon raise the roof

Top down summer
Are you ready for love?
Top down summer
We can drive to forever tonight
Hey baby, the right time's finally here
The top down time of the year

Are we close enough to touch
(Baby, let me show you how)
It's too hot to wear too much
(It's too late to turn back now)

Just walk away Renee

From deep inside the pain that I chose to hide

Eric Carmen,"Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
I asked her if she'd wait for me
But I was gone too long
Tears were in her eyes
She said I took our love and threw it away
And nothin' I could do or say
Could bring it back again

I was tryin' to be somethin' more
Than the man I had come to be
I never meant to leave her sad and lonely
If only she could see

I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters if you've got enough

She walked out that door
And all my dreams went with her into the night
I wondered how a love so right
Could ever slip away
Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
That somewhere deep inside of me
She'll always be the one

I was tryin' to be somethin' more
Than the man I had come to be
Never meant to leave her sad and lonely

Never thought she'd give me a chance
Took her out and told her i loved her

For tonight, i got you all to myself
Tonight, i know there's no one else
Because, tonight you're mine

Whispered to me, ""let's do it again""

You've got your cocaine in your gucci shoes
You've got your palm springs tan in the new york news
You don't like champagne but you take another sip
Inside your private club for the tragically hip

And tonight's just another
In an endless string of one more nights

You need some lovin' to get you through the night
You need some good man to make you feel right
You need that tender touch in the red dawn light
You need some lovin' to get'cha through the night

You're lookin' for a romance
But you're in the wrong place
You feel that hunger but you know you can't taste
So you find some substitute but it leaves you so cold
Too many heartaches, well, they're making you old

And tonight's just another
In an endless string of one more nights

You need some lovin' to get you through the night
You need some good man to make you feel right
You need that tender touch in the red dawn light
You need some lovin' to get'cha through the night

Sailin' 'round the room on your vanity
Dreamin' your unlimited dreams
But your stockings kinda look a little
Frayed around the seams

Here comes tomorrow, it's later than you think
You blew your brains out in the bathroom sink
Look in the mirror and see between the lines
You can run forever but you can't stop time

And tonight's just another
In an endless string of one more nights

You need some lovin' to get you through the night
You need some good man to make you feel right
You need some tender touch in the red dawn light
You need some lovin' to get'cha through the night
Get'cha through the night
Get'cha through the night

That OJ did it; Lee Harvey didn't
An' she's really gone this time

I believe she was a real good thing
Can you believe I let a girl like her get away?
I believe she meant it the night she packed
An' said Jesus is comin' back before she does

Eric Church,"Never realized how much she brought to the table
Till I went to sit my cup of coffee where the table use to be
No cats, no bed, no heirloom antique cradle
An' no more hope for one day startin' that family
Bet she's gainin' fast on Memphis with a trailer-load in tow
Who says you can't take it with you when you go

Cause she got away with everything that I had goin'
An' she got away 'fore I could make it all alright
An' I got away with leavin' what needs said unspoken
Hell, I even blew the chance I had to say goodbye
Yeah, she took her heart an' took off down that road
An' they say you can't take it with you when you go

Good news is, ain't much here left for packin'
Bad news is, she left behind a million memories
All the echoes of her cryin', lovin' an' laughin'
Left me with nothin' left to do but leave
That ol' house is in the rear view: ridin' shotgun is her ghost
Who says you can't take it with you when you go

Cause she got away with everything that I had goin'
An' she got away 'fore I could make it all alright
An' I got away with leavin' what needs said unspoken
Hell, I even blew the chance I had to say goodbye
Yeah, she took her heart an' took off down that road

Eric Church,"I wear a greasy ball cap
I like my shirt un-tucked
I spend Saturdays working on my truck
I don't like to fight
But I ain't scared to bleed
Most don't mess with a guy like me
'Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe that girls like you
Love guys like me

Your daddy worked at the bank
Mine worked on cars
You went to college
I pulled graveyard
You must have had your pick
Of all the trust fund types
But you came back to me and only God knows why
'Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe that girls like you

Now there's a lot of guys like me out there
In a lot of little towns

Let alone in angry weather

Without havin' to watch my Mustang burn
Before my best buddy had to wind up hurt
An' his whole life changed
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way

Only a fool would keep a diamond ring
In a box on the top of his closet
He came so close; he almost asked
It was right there in his pocket
That's a lesson I wish I woulda learned
Before standin' in the back row of that church
Watchin' her daddy givin' her
To the man who took my place
That's a lesson I wish I didn't learn the hard way

Regret's been know to give a man a beatin'
But I ain't in the mood for fightin' back this evenin'

Only fools don't take the time of day
They stay too busy runnin'
An' to stop just once to tell their Dad
Just how much they love him
That's a lesson I wish I woulda learned
Before that phone call came an' it was her

Caught me half way through my first beer

Playing one night roadhouse stands
For tips in empty rooms

Like they had some things to prove

Yeah these boots more than once have saved my ass
Like the time they hid that grass
From those cops in Tupelo
And these boots have danced with the devil
And nearly lost that battle
To a wild-eyed Irish Rose

I've worn out more souls than I can recount
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not
For the roads they led me down
But the damnedest thing I've ever seen them do
Is walkin' out on you.

These boots had to see California
And an Arizona morning where God paints the sky
And these boots had to spur that beast in Cheyenne
Thought that bull'd make me a real man
I still drag that leg sometimes

I've worn out more souls than I can recount
Done more stupid things than most would dare to
I've kicked myself more times than not

But the damnedest thing I've ever seen them do

Stomp out my foolish pride

I just turned eighteen
I was a Friday night hero, with division one dreams
I had an offer on the table
A four year ride
'Til that fourth and two and twenty four dive
I left on a stretcher, wound up on a crutch
Walked on that next summer
Wound up getting cut
Flipped off that coach, left that school in the dust
For letting my dreams go bust
But I thank God I ain't what I almost was

Yea, I moved on back home
And came awful close to being some son-in-law to some CEO
Could of been a corner office, country club, suit and tie man

I ran out on his money, ran out on her love
At four in the morning I loaded my truck
I left my home town in a big cloud of dust
I just had to follow my gut
And I thank God I ain't what I almost was

In guitar town I bought this old Epiphone
Started stringin' chords and words into songs
I've been putting in time on Sixteenth Avenue
Pouring out my heart for tips on a stool
I ain't making a killing, but then there's those nights
When the song comes together and hits 'em just right

Eric Church,"I remember waitin' by the curb with Mr. Murphy
When daddy picked me up from school his eyes were red
We drove to the hospital in a hurry
Where my family gathered round my Grandpa's bed

He was my best friend
He taught me how to fish
And I cried listenin' to my daddy pray
For one of those I've loved along the way

She had a ribbon in her hair the day I met her
That whole next year we couldn't get enough
And after graduation she took off for Denver
And for awhile we both tried to keep in touch

She was my best friend
And it broke my heart
But I don't regret the day that she became
One of those I've loved along the way

And I hope they know
I never woulda made it this far on my own
Where would we all be without those
Fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
The friends I've made, the long lost lovers
I wouldn't be who I am today
If not for those I've loved along the way
Along the way

Now I'm just a country boy with a guitar
Lookin' back down this old road I've been travelin' on
It was never about tryin' to be some big star
For me it's always been about these songs
You see they're my best friends
They're the life I live
And I hope they put a smile on the face
Of those that I've loved along the way
'Cause I wouldn't be the man I am today
If not for those I've loved along the way
Along the way
Along the way",Those I've Loved

There'll be screamin' and there'll be shoutin'

And they gave us a message that would last
And built our house on a foundation of stone

Run under my skin and into my blood,

I see you standin' there all night long
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang, oh

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark

Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear 'Born in the USA'
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky

Thinkin' about you sittin' there sayin' I hate this, I hate it
If you couldn't stand livin' here why'd you take it, take it

The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beatin' me black and blue 'cause you're in every scene

Eric Church,"It was a perfect day for the end of May, they say a record high
I stared at that green water when out of the blue and by surprise
She had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice
She grabbed a beer, said, ""I'm out of here,""
And walked out of my life

That was a cold one
I never will get back
Yeah she had to leave, did she have to leave me one beer
Short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that hell high summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one

It ain't the first time, or the last time
I watched love walk out
But it's damn sure the one time
I still ain't forgot about
I still like to drink a beer but a long neck I won't do
'Cause every time I see one sweating, man
I break out in one too

That was a cold one
I never will get back
Yeah she had to leave, did she have to leave me one beer

She left me hanging high and dry in that hell high summer sun

Eric Church,"Over there in the shadows, hangin' out in the corner of my mind
Stringing up the gallows, waiting for me to cross that line
That man's dangerous as hell, a threat to himself,
If he got out there'd be hell to pay.
And that's why, my dark side, don't ever see the light of day.

I've slowed down on the whiskey, 'cause there always comes a point
When I've had too many, tear down every wall in that joint
I've got a wife, I've got a son, that don't know half the stuff I've done,
And I pray that's the way that it stays
And that's why, my dark side, don't ever see the light of day

You can blame it on the rebel raisin', you can blame it on the South
You can blame it on the words I try to keep here in my mouth
It takes a lot to start me up, but once that hammer drops
You don't wanna be the one that tries to make me stop

All you thugs and ugly mugs dealing drugs and making noise
You can kill each other all you want but if you touch my little boy
You'll be beggin' for this bullet will be the last thing that you see
Before I let my dark side... Come out to play.",Dark Side
Eric Church,"This town, she is a temptress
A siren with gold eyes,
She'll cut you with her kindness,
She will lead you with her lies
She's been called a glistening devil,
She's good at keeping score
If you make it she's your savior
If you don't she's a whore

The roads to and from her heart are littered with grave souls.
They gave all of their all and all they got in return is empty holes.
Sure we've all heard about Shell, and Chris, Willy, and Bobby Bares.
She'd smiled on Johnny's the Merles any music-wrote billionaires.
Like a beacon she goes seeking seed, her loins so fertile.
To a free man she's a prison, to a caged one she's a fire.

She's the reason there's a Sunday morning coming down.
I saw the light, a boy named Sue,
He stopped loving her today. The pill and 16th avenue.
The rhyming, oh she's a diamond the brown eyed mickey
She was Roy Acuff castle and Elvis parsley's broken dream
Its not all bad its not all dark its not all gloom and crass,
But to mine gold in this silver mine it does take balls of brass.
For she's seem 'em come and seen 'em go, and came herself a time or two.

No matter how satisfied her scream sounds she always wants someone new.
The next him or them or her or all to the rest of them all
Be a star in this lady's town you can fuck or you can fight.

You see, it all comes down to money.
Not romantic art of days gone past, if you forget that rule,
You can bet your backside she will bury it in your ass.
A tramp, a slut, a bitch, a mutt, a thousand pawn shop guitars.
A nasty little needle to a vein that feeds a singers heart.
She lurks in friendly shadows, but she's a junky with a limb.
The agents are her bookie and the labels are her pen
I'll tell you a well-known secret of a place known far and wide
The devil walks among us folks and Nashville is his bride

All the chaos he has caused, and done
His greatest tribute to every guitar-toting' dreamer
The devil don't but me, i shook his hand
And i know that he is real, so devil, you can go screw yourself
And then go straight the hell.","Devil, Devil (Prelude: Princess of Darkness)"
Eric Church,"The only joint my mother burned was on the rural route
She sparked in old man tater's woods so she wouldn't be found out
Turned off the dome light and snuck off by herself
Crashed down beneath that window, fired it up, and gave it hell

At that hangout my daddy used to hang around
We watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
Just like after tabs and stooge and tables got turned
To the only joint my momma ever burned

Just like someone flipped a switch, dad started coming home
No more eating late cause supper's with that tater gone
I had my suspicions, til the night when we said grace
Dad said, ""Forgive us, our transgressions as I lit up momma's face.""

At that hangout my daddy used to hang around
We watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
Just like after tabs and stooge and tables got turned
To the only joint my momma ever burned

Been too many nights since its felt us make love.
I wanna rock some Sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall.

Damn you really turn me on, painting your toenails pink.
Easy baby before you say but if I can make it just one more day, and

That old house is gonna be shaking.
I hope those bricks and boards can take it.
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls.
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball.

Eric Church,"I like fast cars and shop dreams,
Chased a lot of crazy things,
Left behind my share of broken pieces
This morning I turned 36
And you just remember half of it
You wonder how you out-lived Hank or Jesus

I put the rage in a river, roll in a thunder
But you kept me from going under
When that current got too heavy

I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
And a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy

Fear I've had none,
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young?

In the mirror I saw my surprise,
Who knew gray hairs like to hide on a head,
Didn't think he'd live past thirty
If I make it thirty more,
It's the brown that you'll be looking for
As you run your fingers through,
Say slow down honey

I put the rage in a river, roll in a thunder
But you kept me from going under
When that current got too heavy

I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
And a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy

Fear I've had none,
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young?

Call it intuition, or call it crazy
Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies
But I'd gladly stick around if we're together

Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind
And with you I'd like to live forever",A  Man Who Was Gonna Die Young
Eric Church,"C'mon

A click clacking my heart keeps making an ominous sound
That chain keeps dragging me up just to drop me back down
I think I'm over the hump enough to see the other side
That's when another thought of you runs through my mind

Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Up and down I go
Over you, about to lose my mind
It's out of control
Round and round, upside down and down upside
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride

Psychedelic trip, my stomach flips again and again
I'd love to get my ticket back but I'm locked in
A white knuckle grip hanging onto what's left of my life
I hate to think about to coming down when I'm up this high

Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Up and down I go
Over you, about to lose my mind
Pain points his gun
And I hold my hands up high
Off the edge I go
On this roller coaster ride

Hang on

I've been on a roller coaster ride

The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago and
Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling, when we finally made it.

To Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Like a storm, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause as we just did.
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,
Rocking rando, getting rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
Til the Alabama sun was breaking

But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and think Jeff Tweedy
Is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood

One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightning hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
And they'll all wanna dance
Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood

First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandana
She was hotter than the devil's Hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers, Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old four-ten
I'm Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood

Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood

So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points
Sand my edges, and I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood
I'm Mr. Misunderstood

They're standing in line, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
A hell if they know, what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind, yeah
Gives the head-scratchers fits
I wondered how in the hell they missed
A Mr. Misunderstood
Mr. Misunderstood

Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class, I was just like you

I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you

Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival

Eric Church,"Use every crayon color that you've got
A fishing pole sinks faster than a tackle box
Nothing turns a day around like licking a mixing bowl
I learned that from a three year old

A garbage can is a damn good spot to hide truck keys
Why go inside when you can go behind a tree?
Walking barefoot through the mud will knock the rust
right off your soul
I learned that from a three year old

You can be a cowboy on the moon
Dig to China with a spoon
Talk to Jesus on the phone
Say I love you all day long
And when you're wrong, you should just say so
I learned that from a three year old

Mama is an angel, I heard him tell the man upstairs
He went on and on and back and forth like God was laying there
Tonight, I sleep me down to lay and pray to keep my soul
Yeah, I learned that from a three year old

You can be a cowboy on the moon
Dig to China with a spoon

Couple arms to kill the cold

It would be in your arms.

Eric Clapton,"Every morning when I wake, a feeling soon begins to overtake me.
Ringing in my ears resounds through my brain; it finally surrounds me.
There is fire, there is life, there is passion, fever and fury.
There is love and there is hate, there is longing, anger and worry.

[Chorus]
Oh, I have a flame; feel it touch my heart.
And down at my core is the hottest part.
I can burn without fuel.

If it should become too cold, I know I can endure the frostbite.
Oh, a blanket then I'll wrap around me; I keep myself so close to my side.
No one then can cause me harm, just as the river runs into the sea.
Cause every day, your fire alarm is deafening the silence all around me.

[Chorus]

It is burning.
It is burning.

You can trust me; we can laugh. Together we can share our sorrow.
I will give you secrets too, an attitude that you may borrow.
Gypsy woman said to me, ""One thing you must bear in your mind:
You are young and you are free, but damned if you're deceased in your own lifetime.""

Oh, you have a flame; feel it in your heart.
And down at the core is the hottest part.
We can burn without fuel.

It's really good to see you once again.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.

I'm sure the distance wouldn't be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are.

Eric Clapton,"Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car.
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far.
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table.

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark.
I told you 'bout the swans, that they live in the park.
Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to mabel.

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down.
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you.
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue.
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle.",Badge

All along, had to talk about it,
Like a two-edged sword, he touched you and it stabs me.
All along, knew you were a phony girl,
Sit behind the mask where you control your world.

Yesterday he had you in his arms
When I'm holding you, I feel his bitter charms.
I can't judge what you do to me.
Camoflage the truth, indulge your fantasy.

Who do you love?  Is it me now, is it him babe?  I don't know.
Who do you love?  Is it me babe, is it him now?  I don't know.

There is nothing in your eyes that's the way you cry.
All is grand, all is bright.  You're just studying my mind.
There is nothing in your eyes that's the way you cry.
All is grand, all is bright.  You're just studying my mind.

Was I invited to your masquerade?
Well the party's over so now take off your face.
You say you love, but it's hard to see
When you're in his arms, throwing rocks at me.

I walk around suffering in my doom.
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room.
The truth is news, I have longed to trace.

Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.

This beautiful lady that's walking around with me

With tales of brave Ulysses

How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you
To touch their white laced lips

And you see a girl?s brown body
Dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow
Where the sky loves the sea

And when your fingers find her
She drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples
In the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes
Run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite
And she rides a crimson shell
You know you cannot leave her
For you touched the distant sands

Eric Clapton,"God's got a plan, he's making it clear
Sweet little love song in your ear
Like hearts made of diamond, love will prevail
Put a little wind in your sail

[Chorus:]
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love

Listen now baby, I'll tell you true
Just how much that I love you

I walked that road for so long
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
Your love is making me strong 

[Chorus:]
I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love 

And now I see that my life has been so blue
With all the heartaches I had till I met you
But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me
With you here by my side
And there's no more memories to remind me

But I get a little worried sometimes
When I start to lose
Tired of holding it together
When I know I'm going to blow another fuse

[Chorus]
I'm at my breaking point
My breaking point
I'm at my breaking point
My breaking point

Well you're never gonna get it
If you don't get up and try
Try and spread those wings around me
Honey let me see you fly

That's right
But I get a little worried sometimes
When I start to lose
Tired of holding it together

That you'll finally realize",Breaking Point

Well I soon found out
Just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes
Just to pay the rent

Talkin' 'bout hard times
Lord those hard times
Who knows better than I?

I had a woman
Who was always around
But when I lost my money
She put me down

Don't give me no alibis

You better stop and climb out

When will I ever learn?

[Chorus:]
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face

I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn

Satisfied but lost in love
Situations change
You're never who you used to think you are
How strange

Lately I've been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?

Lately I've been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I'd have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way

I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
I'd find a love who cares just for me

Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you

Eric Clapton,"I remember yet before we met
When every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely one.
And I remember meeting you,
Discovering love could be so true
When shared by two, 'stead of only one.

When you said you loved me
We could not be parted.
Said, I built my world around you
And I'm truly glad I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
I never felt so good before.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Yes it has, you know it has.

Each night I pray we'll never part
Because the love within my heart
Grows stronger from day to day.
Best I try, hard I try
To reassure and satisfy.
You know I'd be lost if you went away.

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Yes it has, I know it has.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.

And all your fears unspoken.

To living lies with no escape,
Lord, I would rather be alone.

I press my fingers to the wood
To tell you of my dreaming,
To sing you songs from olden times,
To keep the love light gleaming.

'Cause there's a place where we can go,
Where we will not be parted.
And who alone will enter there?
Only the broken hearted.

Only the broken, broken hearted [Repeat: x4]",Broken Hearted

And his smile so bright. 
In his hands are the toys you gave 
To fill his heart with delight.

And in the ring stands a circus clown 
Holding up a knife. 
What you see and what you will hear 
Will last you for the rest of your life. 

And it's sad  so sad  
There ain't no easy way round. 
And it's sad  so sad  
All you friends gather round 
'Cause the circus left town. 

Little man with his heart so pure 
And his love so fine. 
Stick with me and I'll ride with you 
Till the end of the line. 

Hold my hand and I'll walk with you 
Through the darkest night. 
When I smile I'll be thinking of you 
And every little thing will be all right.

Eric Clapton,"The point on the water, there's a change in the air,
A vibe in the darkness but there's nobody there.
I look for the reason but there's nothing to see,
Just a hole in my memory where my mind used to be.

Tell me why
Can I find no relief in my heart.
I reside
In a world that has fallen apart.
Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby,
Show me a way to get back on time, please.
Where do we go, baby, how will I know?
Who holds the key, is it hidden inside of me?

But why should I worry and why do I care
When this road that I walk on is going nowhere.
I stand and I study every face in the crowd,
See the fear in their eyes, they must be thinking out loud.

[Chorus:]
Scratching the surface, it all looks the same;
A world full of anger with no one to blame.
But who can I turn to? Who holds the key?
And who has the answer? I think it's inside of me.

All things considered it looks as though 
Utopia were far closer to us than anyone, only fifteen 
Years ago, could have imagined. 
Then, I projected it six hundred years into the future. 
Today it Seems quite possible that the 
Horror may be upon us within a single century. 

That is, if we refrain 
From blowing ourselves to smithereens in the interval. 
Indeed, unless we choose to decentralize and 
To use applied science, not as the end to which human 
Beings are to be made the means, but as the 
Means to producing a race of free individuals,
We have only two alternatives to choose from, either 

A number of national militarized totalitarianism, 
Having as their root the terror of the atomic 
Bomb and as their consequence the destruction of 
Civilization (or, if the warfare is limited, the 
Perpetuation of militarism) or else one 
Supranational totalitarianism

Called into existence by the 
Social chaos resulting from rapid technological progress in general and 
The atomic revolution in 
Particular, and developing, under the need for efficiency and stability, 
Into the welfare-tyranny of Utopia. 
You pays your money and you takes your choice.",Inside of Me
Eric Clapton,"Sailing down behind the sun, 
Waiting for my prince to come. 
Praying for the healing rain 
To restore my soul again. 

Just a toe rag on the run. 
How did I get here? 
What have I done? 
When will all my hopes arise? 
How will I know him? 
When I look in my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
When I look in my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 

Then the light begins to shine 
And I hear those ancient lullabies. 
And as I watch this seedling grow, 
Feel my heart start to overflow. 

Where do I find the words to say? 
How do I teach him? 
What do we play? 
Bit by bit, I've realized 
That's when I need them, 
That's when I need my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
That's when I need my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 

Then the jagged edge appears 
Through the distant clouds of tears. 
I'm like a bridge that was washed away; 
My foundations were made of clay. 

As my soul slides down to die. 
How could I lose him? 
What did I try? 
Bit by bit, I've realized 
That he was here with me; 
I looked into my father's eyes.

I looked into my father's eyes.

Eric Clapton,"You left him standing in the pouring rain.
There's every chance he'll go insane.
And someone comes along and takes his hand.
He must have love, can't you understand, that

[Chorus:]
He needs his woman,
He needs his woman,
And he needs his woman,
He needs his woman to love.

His hands are shaking and his head hangs down.
No peace of mind for him is found.
Break his heart and then you'll set him free.
Someone must save him, just you wait and see, but

[Chorus]

What will it take till you believe his love is real? 
Nobody said he had to love you, now he always will.

He'll walk that lonely road again today.
The love he gave you, you threw away.
When all he wanted was a hand to hold.
His lonely world has grown so cold, and

I got to push on through  babe  
And if I take the chance of seeing you again 
I just don't know what I would do  baby 
And sometimes I think I'm gonna be just fine 
All I got to do is go through it  babe. 

Then I hear those voices in the back of my mind  
Telling me over and over and over that I blew it babe. 

You had one chance and you blew it 
You may never get another chance 
You had the floor and you knew it 
You can't blame it on your circumstance 
At the risk of causing you a little pain 
I'm going to have to forget you, babe 
'Cause you broke my heart, left it out in the rain 
And you'd the same again if I let you, babe. 

I would give anything to hold you in my arms 
But you know I can't do that, baby. 

I guess I'll have to live with the choice that I have made 
Even though deep down I still suspect that I blew it.",One Chance
Eric Clapton,"And how do I choose and where do I draw the line
Between truth and necessary pain?
And how do I know and where do I get my belief
That things will be all right again?

What words do I use to try and explain
To those who have witnessed all my tears?
And what does it mean to know all these things
When love's been wasted all these years
When love's been wasted all these years.

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand,
Removed from other people
Who could never understand.

I was a pilgrim for your love,
A pilgrim for your love,
A pilgrim for your love,
I was a pilgrim for your love.

It's like living in a nightmare,
Like looking in the blackest hole,
Like standing on the edge of nothing,
Completely out of control.

Now where have I been all these years
And how come I just couldn't see?
Like a blind man walking 'round in darkness,
I was a pilgrim for your love,
I was a pilgrim for your love.

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand,
Removed from other people
Who could never understand.

I was a pilgrim for your love,

That would carry me away 
Two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today

It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I will hide my face

That I ran from in disgrace

Seven hours seven days or seven years? 

All I know is since you've been gone

In three more days, I'll leave this town 
And disappear without a trace
A year from now, maybe settle down 
Where no one knows my face

I wish that I could hold you 
One more time to ease the pain
But my time's run out and I got to go
Got to run away again

Still I catch myself thinking
One day I'll find my way back here
You'll save me from drowning

Eric Clapton,"Diamonds of silvery rain in the fountains
And ten-cent red roses from department store counters
Watching the moonlight reflect off the river
Beside where the trains cross the bridge and slow down
Trains with white letters on black iron sides
And white rushing water that all rolls away
And Little Miss Someone does not want to stay
Everyone's moving, with places to go
And Mr Zero - he sadly stands still
As the water goes one way, the train goes another
Mr Zero stands still, and Miss Someone don't bother

Yesterday's kiss will be cold by tomorrow
As campfires of midnight dissolve in the darkness
The room is deserted, the blinds have been drawn
Little Miss Someone has packed up and gone
Fast moving cars disappear down the highway
With signs that say: ""hitch-hikers: do not disturb""
Mr Zero looks quietly up from the curb
Morning has faded, and shadows have grown
And Little Miss Someone is on her way home
Mr Zero stands watching - her plane flies above
And with frost-bitten hands waves goodbye to his love

Walks through the park on a bright summer Sunday
And tapestry kittens that hung on the wall
They all die in the air like a soft minor chord
A vacancy sign, and a bulletin board
Mr Zero is wrapping his jacket around him
Speaking kind words that should have been said long ago
But Little Miss Someone does not want to know
The night is deserted, there's dust on the shelf
Mr Zero sits lonely and talks to himself
It's too late to change, the fine line has been crossed
The charades are all done, Mr Zero has lost",Mr. Zero

Eric Clapton,"If you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
Yes you do.

Well, if you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
They got such pretty little girls in that big town,
Make a man want to jump around and shout.
I met a little girl there,
She was about five foot eight.

I said ""I want you to love me.""
She said ""Why man, that'd be great.""

So,
I got long hair but,
She took me back,
Back to see her pad,
But the first thing I saw when I arrived there,
Was a big black shiny shotgun,
In the hands of her dad.

Alright now, this is how it was,
Oh no!
Well alright!
I finally learned my lesson,
Such a long time ago,
Next little woman that I date,
I've got to know, I've got to know her family too.

Yes indeed, I gotta know her family too.

To restore my soul again.

When will all my hopes arise?
How will I know him?
When I look in my fatherÂ´s eyes.

When I look in my fatherÂ´s eyes.

And I hear those ancient lullabies.
And as I watch this seedling grow,
Feel my heart start to overflow.

Where do I find the words to say?
How do I teach him?
What do we play?

ThatÂ´s when I need them,
ThatÂ´s when I need my fatherÂ´s eyes.

ThatÂ´s when I need my fatherÂ´s eyes.

Then the jagged edge appears
Through the distant clouds of tears.
IÂ´m like a bridge that was washed away;
My foundations were made of clay.

As my soul slides down to die.
How could I lose him?
What did I try?
Bit by bit, IÂ´ve realized
That he was here with me;
I looked into my fatherÂ´s eyes.

And disappear without a trace,
A year from now maybe settle down,
Where no one knows my face,

I wish that I could hold you,
One more time to ease the pain,
But my times run out and I got to go,
Got to run away again,

Still I catch myself thinking,
One day I'll find my way back here,
You'll save me from drowning,

Can you judge a man,
By the way he wears his hair?
Can you read his mind,
By the clothes that he wears?
Can you see a bad man,
By the pattern on his tie?

Well then, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.

Could you tell a wise man,
By the way he speaks or spells?
Is this more important,
Than the stories that he tells?
And call a man a fool,
If for wealth he doesn't strive?

Well then, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.

Can you condemn a man,
If you're faith he doesn't hold?
Say the colour of his skin,
Is the colour of his soul?
Could you say that men,
For king and country all must die?

Well, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.

Moving in the wrong direction
I don't know where I belong
I don't know what I will do if I can't get
Back home 

Troubles I got all my own 
They don't fit no other person
The memories keep rolling on 
And I don't know what I will do if I can't get 
Back home

I don't fit, but I don't give a damn 
I won't quit, cause I know who I am 
And I'll admit, that I've been on the left

Bit by bit, I'll review my plan 
This is it, I'll do the best I can
Trust and understand

Cause I know that I am loved
Cause I'll be on my way 
Got no need to stay 'round here

There's a train people say 
I could ride to get my whole life straight 
But the bridge on the way 
Has a toll too much for me to pay

What I chose could mean my destiny 
Lights are green all is go 
But my heart keeps telling my mind no

There's a plane over there 
Where all are given even share

But I'm in doubt I must decline 
'Cause even friends can change their lines

Eric Clapton,"We went down to the seaside,
One cold frosty morning.
Just to go out for a drive,
For an hour or two.

I walked down to the water,
With my love and our baby.
Watched the waves breaking in,
We're enjoying the view.

Then I heard myself saying,
""We should do this more often,
To watch the little ones playing,
On that bright stony shore.""

And I wished deep down in my heart,
That we could stay here forever.
In these sweet simple moments,
That will come back no more.

When it's 3 o'clock in the morning,
And something scared you from your breast,
I will gently rock you in my arms,
And lay your little head on my chest,

And when you run, from my arms,
Know we'll always find you.
And when you run, out of loving,
And run home to me. (Run home to me)

And the years fly by so quickly,
Like a plane before my eyes,
And you've grown up into a woman,
Before I had time, had time to realize.

And then you'll run, from my arms,
And we'll always come and find you.
And when you run, out of loving,
Then run home to me.

Lord when you run, run out of my arms,
We will always come and find you,
And when you run, out of loving,
Then run home to me. (Run home to me)",Run Home to Me

A long black dress and the call of the wild.
I was a fool to think she was just a child.
Out of my mind, out of control.
Knew that feeling too well, tried to run but I fell.

[Chorus]

I never meant to feel this way,
Now I always want to stay...

Eric Clapton,"In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves",White Room [DVD]
Eric Clapton,"Lately I've been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right

Lately I've been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I'd have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way

[Chorus]
I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
I'd find a love who cares just for me

All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you

Before we explode

I get off on fifty seven chevies
I get off on a screamin' guitar
Like the way it gets me
Every time it hits me.
I've got a rock 'n' roll
I've got a rock 'n' roll heart.
Feels like we're falling
Into the arms of the night

Don't be holding me so tight
Guess there's nothing left
For me to explain
Here's what you're gettin'
And I don't wnna change
Ain't gonna change.

No Hollywood;
All you got to do is lay down
Lay it down good.

Driving in a Pontiac,
Just about to lose my mind.
I was going to Arizona,
Maybe on to California
Where people all live so fine.

My mother says I'm crazy,
My baby calls me lazy,
But I'm gonna show them all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool and
I don't need no more damn schoolin'.
I was born to just walk the line.

Living on Tulsa time.
Living on Tulsa time.
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know that I've been through it.
Living on Tulsa time.

So there I was in Hollywood,
Thinking I was doing good,
Talking on the telephone line.
They don't want me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs;
My mama says my baby's doing fine.

So then I started winking,
Then I started thinking
That I really had a flash this time.
That I had no bussiness leaving,
And nobody would be grieving;
You see I'm on Tulsa time.

Living on Tulsa time.
Living on Tulsa time.
Gonna set my watch back to it

Is it love or is it me
That makes me change so suddenly?
Looking out, feeling free

Sit here lying in my bed
Wondering what it was I'd said
That made me think I'd lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

Won't you please read my signs, be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
Because you can find my mind, please be with me

Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd
'Cause in the end it all comes out unsure",Please Be with Me (Acoustic) [Session Outtake] [#]

How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through

Eric Clapton,"Someday we'll build a home on a Hilltop High
You and I, shiny and new
Cottage that two can fill
And we'll be pleased to be called
The folks who live on the Hill

Someday, we may be adding a wing or two
A thing or two
We will make changes as any family will
But we will always be called
The folks who live on the Hill

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen
And when our kids grow up and leave us
We'll sit and look at that same old view
Just we two, Darby and Joan
Who used to be Jack and Jill

If we fools in life, oh woman a happy fool I'd rather be.

Oh baby I'll be glad to learn from you
And darlin' I know you will be glad to learn from me
And if we get down and things get sad, we can cheer up each other
And grin 'cause things just ain't that bad
If we fools in life, than a happy fool I would rather be

Day by day, just one step, one step at a time
'Cause woman you have given me so much
Just to ease this stubborn little achin' heart of mine

I don't care where they came from
And I don't care what they might say
Woman you've been lovin' in my corner, all the way
Day by day, that's the magical kind 'cause it's flowin' all of the time

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Footsteps that you hear down the hall

Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow,
What you need is someone strong to use you
Like me,
Like me.
If you want to get your soul to heaven,
Trust in me.
Don't judge or question.
You are broken now,
But faith can heal you.
Just do everything I tell you to do.
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.
Let me lay my holy hand upon you.
My God's will
Becomes me.
When he speaks out,
He speaks through me.
He has needs
Like I do.
We both want
To rape you.
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life.
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
And your lies.",Opiate
Eric Gorfain,"I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it.
Finding beauty in the dissonance.
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any
Sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers/brothers",Schism

In his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold
 
Will you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold
 
I never made promises lightly and there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

See the children run as the sun goes down among the fields of gold

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

To win her love is nothing I wouldn't do
Talking to her all would seem would give her a thrill

Well, I might have stretched the truth just a tiny bit
When I told her that I had one with a continental kit
Ya, well, I don't steal but I've been known to borrow
Ya, tonight we've been rolling like there's no tomorrow

She's cuddling up close rubbing my back
Doing a little this, doing a little that
I'm sure gonna hate to have to sneak it back
But we've been riding 'round in someone else's Cadillac

I got my uncle Willy's watch and my daddies money clip
My cousin Bubbas black boots with a golden silver tips
Ya, she's purring like a kitten, I'm the cats meow
I'm gonna trade a weeks pay for a night on the town

Well, how could I tell her what she don't know
When she's sitting here thinking, I'm a king of the road
Ya, well, I don't steal but I've been known to borrow

We were in the back seat parked under the stars
When I saw the blue lights of that police car
Ya, well officer, now I don't steal but I've been known to borrow
Ya, tonight we've been rolling like there's no tomorrow

Now can you find it in your heart to cut me some slack
I'll admit, it ain't mine sir, that's a fact
But I was gonna take her home and then sneak it on back
Ya we've been riding 'round in someone else's Cadillac

Love has got me down
The weight is all around
So you lend a hand to peace on earth
Here's my piece, now what's it worth
Yea, but it's all right
When you can't define the crime
Then life ain't worth a dime
When they take away everything you got
And they rub your nose in the funky spot
Not without a fight
When you work your fingers to the bone
And what does that get you--nothing
If in a crowd of people
You're still alone I hope that tells you something
The road to heaven is paved in hell
And it makes you wonder 
Why you're here at all
Check out the shape of your circumstance
He wears the dress and she wears the pants
Here comes Jill and she needs romance
But you can't do jack so shut up and dance!

Love one another right now.

You will understand.
You hold the key to love and fear,
All in your trembling hand.
One key unlocks them both, you know,
It's at your command.",Get Together
Eric Hutchinson,"I can't write my words
When I don't have you
I can't sing my song
When my strings won't tune

You won't believe me
You won't believe me crying
I can't walk my path
When I can't say motivated

I can't play my part
When it gets too complicated
You won't believe me
You won't believe me
So you'll never see me

Give me a reason and I won't breakdown
And if that's all that you've got
You'd better not get caught
I've got more in store

I can't keep my beat
When I don't have you
I can't shake my sins
When you don't come through

How could you leave me
Just when you see me crying
And I can't feel low down
When I don't have legs to stand on

I can't feel low down
When I there ain't no ground to land on
How could you leave me
How could you leave me
Now you'll never see me

Eric Hutchinson,"Call me crazy if you've got it in you
But these people don't seem to mind
Sweet vermouth now you're telling me the truth
A little stubbornness will work out fine

A bottom feeder at the end of my rope
But I'm wondering where this rope began
Gonna circle around what I couldn't help bring down
It's just supply with demand

Nothing looks the same
Even when there's been no change
Say that somethings gonna give
And it's all giving out on you

When it's all over now
It's all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now

A large pickup truck with a little cargo towed
Gets from baker's to the laundromat
These daily fights all start to sound alike
I guess I'm gonna have to live with that

Short changed
Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition
Short changed
Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition

Will I simply peel away
Feels more likely everyday
Say that somethings gonna give
And it's all giving out on you

When it's all over now
It's all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now

And if you came here to tell me that you're sorry
For the pain you couldn't cause
Then save your breath and use it
Just to regain what you have lost and look at the cost",All Over Now
Eric Hutchinson,"And now I'm trying to decide if I feel dirty at all
Cause it gets hard to tell
It's never just black and white she's got a mind of her own
And she uses it well

So she invites me over outside villanova
She's got some pull-out sofa that we won't hardly need
She is only drinking soda revving up that motor
Got places we could go to but I still won't believe

That she's only gifted
When I'm standing by her side
She goes unassisted
And I start to relax as I cut her some slack

[Chorus]
So get up I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows
What I've done and what I'm gonna do ?again

And in the middle of the night I have a breakdown of sorts
With regret creeping in
She's gonna put up a fight and she will get her way
Cause she loves sleeping in

So I need someone to side with when she begins confiding
And I cannot provide it cause I'm endlessly cold
She says she's so excited to play some groom and bride
With me but I'm undecided so I need to be told

That she's only sinking
When I'm sleeping by her side
With a change of thinking
I could pull us away even just for a day

[Chorus]

She grows impatient to change my tune
She's geting older and legal soon
And I wasn't ready to start out and go upsetting
Some girl that I'd be forgetting
By the time the cops came by that afternoon
And I try to decide as she pulls me aside

[Chorus]",Outside Villanova
Eric Hutchinson,"He's been waiting around for the weekend
Figuring which club to sneak in
Fancy drinks and fifty dollar cover charge
Lately it's been a big hassle

Heineken and new castle
To make sure he's fitting in and living large
Disregard the lies that he will tell and what he's probably like
'Cause it's not hard his charm is gonna get him through the night

If he wants to rock he rocks
If he wants to roll he rolls
He can roll with the punches long as he feels like he's in control
If he wants to stay he stays
If he wants to go he goes
He doesn't care how he gets there long as he gets somewhere he knows

See her heavy makeup and cut t-shirt
Every girl out wants to be her
But they look the same already why adjust
Reading the magazine secrets
Forgetting the topical regrets
'Cause if she comes home all alone the night's a bust
It's a must the swivel in her hips and the look she gives
It's all her trust if only in the morning she knew where she lived

If she wants to rock she rocks
If she wants to roll she rolls
She can roll with the punches long as she feels like she's in control
If she wants to stay she stays
If she wants to go she goes
She doesn't care how she gets there long as she gets somewhere she knows

And in a wink they're on the brink
From drink to drink and at the bar with cash to blow
Shot to shot it's getting hot
Advance the plot to see how far it's gonna go

All depends so ditch the friends and grab a cab
Another chance at cheap romance
Doesn't count 'cause the room is spinning
Nothing to lose tonight they both are winning
And they fall in love as they fall in bed

If they want to rock they rocks
If they want to roll they rolls
They can roll with the punches long as they feels like they're in control
If they want to stay they stay
If they want to go they go
They don't care how they get there long as they get somewhere they know",Rock & Roll
Eric Hutchinson,"New life decides to come through the front door
And makes us wish we'd shown respect before
Though I don't have much of a choice
I resolve to regain my voice

[Chorus]
If I only just begin to understand it that's because
Everytime I time I start to change my mind again
It gets me back to where I was

The two of us deciding what to do
Though my hands are all but tied
I rebound so I can say at least I tried

But I never get used to putting you off
And no one could've scripted this who knows what'll come of it
I refuse to believe it was all just a waste

[Chorus]
Cause look around
Everybody's on the food chain
Funny but from day to day we get bottom to top
And if you get lost you start over again
But we don't ever get to no we don't ever get to stop

I wake up in the oblivious state go to sleep trying to save some face
Cause I've never been one for acting naïve
And so what we've got nothing to prove
Why on earth would we soften the mood
Do we think that this wire is better left live

I would've known better if I was on the outside
I would've known better if I was on the outside
Looking in looking in
But this chain just eats away at the people who use it
No ones gonna say that it's easier losing
Touch with who we need
When it's lonelier on the outside

[Chorus]",Food Chain
Eric Hutchinson,"Long as I am erasing this there's something I am bound to miss
Opportunities exist but often don't arise
And think of how it must have felt to watch you walk away and melt
I keep it all inside myself and in between my eyes
And it's no surprise what we've become
Since the arrival has begun

It hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright
I'm only concerned with the way we end up
I think I've been wrong enough to know when I'm right
So put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone
It hasn't been long enough

I feel as if I spoke too soon and ruined the whole afternoon
A feeling that we're more than doomed is creeping up inside
And good as it was bound to be there's something about you and me
It's negative in chemistry which makes it hard to hide
And it's no surprise when lights are falling
It's bound to re-awake some primal calling

It hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright
I'm only concerned with the way we end up
I think I've been wrong enough to know when I'm right
So put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone
It hasn't been long enough

What's making you believe that the seventh time around is gonna be different
You know I'm not convinced
Long as the knot was tied problems always were around
And I'm not any different so I won't listen",It Hasn't Been Long Enough
Eric Hutchinson,"I got arrested in the dark of the night
The cop got restless as he read me my rights
He told me, ""I'm always envious of those that I jail
If I got locked up nobody come to help me post bail""
And I said ""oh!""

Went to a party on the side of a hill
Met three Latinas who had gotten their fill.
They told me ""nobody ever gets us down on our knees
Simply to help us take a load off our feet.""
And I said ""oh!""

And I'm never sure what I'm living for but it's always on my mind
Someone comes along always proves me wrong think im gonna be fine

I picked a pocket just to give it all back
Took out the license left the money in tact
The man said ""I wanna thank you"" and I had to ask why
""That was the old me I was living a lie""
And I said ""oh!""

Riding the subway with the scent of her hair
She took out a toothbrush started using it there
She explained ""I'm always sure today's the day I will die
I wanna look good if I get to look god in the eye""
And I said ""oh!""

And I'm never sure what I'm living for but it's always on my mind
Someone comes along always proves me wrong think im gonna be fine

We get lost in the back of our minds
Got nothing to burn but time time time
Everybody's got the love but they keep it inside

Met an acquaintance we were reintroduced
With more in common than we had in our youth
She told me ""you look the same"" I said ""I'm now a new man""
She asked me ""how does that work"" ""I started giving a damn""
And I said ""oh!""",Oh!
Eric Hutchinson,"Okay it's alright with me some things are just meant to be
It never comes easily and when it does I'm already gone
I'm practically never still more likely to move until I end up alone at will
My life continues inching along

When Bernadette comes I get lost on her tide
She's much too sweet and she's always gonna be
When I return to her arms and her eyes
It might not be the same but it's alright with me

Okay it's alright with me some people are scared to see
What's happening frequently but I would never shy from a fight
Heartbeat with a high demand often will go hand in hand
But I'm sick of just starting plans I wanna spend the rest of my life.

I'm going down to the basement ya'll
Where people all have a good time
The parties that I hear have nothing to do with
My ears are going out of my mind, mind, mind
Down here they play the real thing

It's a cliche to put it this way
But they don't make em like that anymore, more, more, more
So if they put me in the spot light
I'm never leaving the floor

I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
Cause I really want to rock and roll
Oh

An old man gets on the mic
Tells us to hang our burdens up
He says songs you hear today all start to get in the way
Till you're barely feeling the love, love, love, love
He drops the needle on a pop song
He drops the needle on some soul
And I watch a pimp fall in love over there
Dancing to songs their parents would know, know, know, know
So everybody give me room now
Watch me cut a rug in the show

I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
I'm going down to the basement
Cause I really want to rock and roll

Let your body do just what it likes
Just want to hear some favorite before my years
Dance soldiers forgetting our day jobs

With bottle service just for sport

Trying to keep up with the bros
Talking bout bank accounts and leaving off zeros

Acting flush was not that hard

But you're still...
Where do I fit in
When I'm watching you watch him?

God only knows why I still wait around
Except I hate to see you cry
And I need you, but there are things I cannot do
And I love you like a broken record plays

Got to know where you stand
If you are going to try to make a move
She is standing alone with her girls and I don't think she minds
You better not give a damn
If you are going to be one of those dudes
I've seen a thousand come round and she
justs shoot them all down the cold shoulder

So if you want my advice don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed 
You could give her your heart she wants your sister's instead 
Better forget about Joni

Her black hair shines in the night
A fixture smile and she loves to tease
All the atheates and actors have called but she's never responded
She's got those jeans on so tight
She's half egyptian and half japanese
Each time she batting an eye congressmen senators cry 
Oh mama help me

So if you want my advise don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed
You can give her your heart she wants your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni

Jajajajaja Joni

All the men want Joni so much
But she don't want the touch of a man

Your gonna know where you were
The very moment that you caught these blues
And you will lie awake all through your nights wondering what she's doing
Just look at me if your unsure
I've walked a thousand miles in your shoes
I've spent the rest of my life back at this bar everynight trying to love her

So if you want my advice
Don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed 
You can forgive her your heart she wasn't your sister's instead

And on the back she wrote the words that she could not say
On the front a desert sky orange red and brown 
She wrote will you think of me when the sun goes down

She wrote it wasn't anything I did
To make her leave me all alone to raise both our kids 
Said she cannot spend the night in that desert town
Cause she always thinks of me when the sun goes down

So hard to know how long its gonna take
To hear the heart that was never supposed to break
She said to tell her mother hi for her
And that she thinks of coming home but she's still not sure
Plays piano when she can
But she hates the sound
And she always thinks of me when sun goes down

So hard to know how long it's gonna take 
To hear the heart that was never supposed to break

When you're chewing on life's gristle,
Don't grumble, give a whistle!
And this'll help things turn out for the best 
And 
 
Always look on the bright side of life!
 
Always look on the bright side of life 
If life seems jolly rotten,
There's something you've forgotten!
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
 
When you're feeling in the dumps,
Don't be silly chumps,
Just purse your lips and whistle -- that's the thing!
And  always look on the bright side of life 
 
Come on!
 
Always look on the bright side of life 
 
For life is quite absurd,
And death's the final word.
You must always face the curtain with a bow!
Forget about your sin -- give the audience a grin,
Enjoy it, it's the last chance anyhow!
 
So always look on the bright side of death!
Just before you draw your terminal breath.
Life's a piece of shit,
When you look at it.
 
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true,
You'll see it's all a show,
Keep 'em laughing as you go.
Just remember that the last laugh is on you!
 
And always look on the bright side of life 

Always look on the bright side of life

Come on guys, cheer up

Always look on the bright side of life 

Always look on the bright side of life 

Worse things happen at sea you know

Always look on the bright side of life 

I mean, what have you got to lose?
you know, you come from nothing
you're going back to nothing
what have you lost? Nothing!

Eric Idle,"Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown,
And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,

And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
In all of the directions it can whiz;
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!",The Galaxy Song

Track: Lonely in the Night

Here she comes -- alone in the night
She looks in your eyees while she's breaking your heart
And her smile -- Mona Lisa style
She lends you her heart -- Lets you think you're the only one
But she'll leave you...

Lonely in the night
She breaks all her lovers' hearts
Lonely in the night
Dreaming of a love that fades away

When she wants -- she gets what she wants
She looks in your eyes and you give her everything
So demure -- so insecure
Oh how she conceals -- all that she really feels
And she'll leave you...

Lonely in the night
As she breaks another heart (that's)
Lonely in the night
Dreaming of a love that fades

Lonely in the night
As she breaks another heart (that's)

I hear a strong wind whine
Goin' to where the freedom bells ring

Without a mountain guide

Took such a while to find you
Oh, could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew
You're the only one, so take me through High Landrons

Up ahead, I know the trail way stops
From there on, only eagles fly
Burning with visions of the way back to you
They're burnin' through the eastern sky

Now and then I see a shooting star
Lighting up the silver blue
It's shining all the way down the mountain skyway
Oh, it's shining straight from you

Eric Kloss,"There are ladies in my life
Lovely ladies in these lazy days 
And though I never took a wife 
May I say that I have loved me one or two 
Of the people in my past
Fading faces in a waking dream
And though they never seemed to last very long 
There are faces I remember 
From the places in my past
I said all the dead head miles 
And the insincere smiles 
Sometimes I can laugh and cry 
And I can't remember why 
But I still love those
Good times gone by 
Hold on to them close or let them go, oh no
I don't know 
I just seem to sing these songs 
And say I'm sorry for the friends I used to know ",Places in My Past

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Lui si beau et moi si lais

Je te donnerais la lune

Tu ne voudrais pas m'aimer

Et lui sans faire un seul geste

Sans un mot sans un regard

Il a mis de la tendresse

Au fond de tes grands yeux noirs

Tu lui donneras ton corps

Tu croiras à ses serments

Tu l'aimes pour le dehors

Sans voir ce qu'il why a dedans

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Lui seigneur et moi vaurien

Il te donnera la lune

Toi qui ne demandais rien

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Aime ton beau cavalier

La satin de ta peau brune

N'est pas pour les va-nu-pieds

Ma laideur est une insulte

A ta beauté insolente

Une erreur de la nature

Qui ne me fut pas aimante

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Notre lot n'est pas le leur

Nous n'avons pas de fortune

Mais eux, ont-ils donc un coeur ?

Ils sont nés dans la dentelle

Pour faire l'amour et la guerre

Mais nous pauvres vers de terre

Notre vie est bien plus belle

Et de quel côté est Dieu

do côté des ostensoirs

Ou bien do côté de ceux

Qui le prient matin et soir

Ce Jésus que l'on adore

A t-il toujours préféré

Les Rois Mages avec leur or

A nous autres pauvres bergers

Dieu que la vie est cruelle

Pour deux coeurs qui se cherchaient

Moi si laid et toi si belle

Comment pourrais-tu m'aimer

But I walk through the fire alone
The tree by my window
Turns gray in November
I watch the leaves as they fall
The branches left naked
Reach up so proudly
I wish to God you would call
But me I'm the dead one
You are the lover
Who loved me right down to my bones
Now I walk through the fire alone
The powers that push me
They move me they own me
They constantly tell me to run
I try not to listen
I try to fight them
But never a battle I've won
So let go of lovers
I let go of diamonds
I've plenty of sins to atone
While I walk through the fire alone
Hold onto your children
Hold onto your mama
Hold onto the ones that you love
Hold onto your heart
Hold onto your visions
Hold onto what you're dreaming of
If there's something missing
Or if you're hiding from
Someone you long to have known
Then you'll walk through the fire
Walk through the fire
Walk through the fire alone",Walk Through the Fire

Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,

Stuck in traffic going slow, nothing on the radio
I don't wanna be another chore to check off on your list
Of things you gotta do and places that you gotta go, oh no

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night
Oh your Friday night

We can rock together, let the good times roll forever
Fill up our cup make a memory, drink it up
I don't wanna miss another minute, wanna live it with you
Beneath the blue sky fallin' in love

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot

Little black dress on
Standing with the other girls
Wearing velvet and pearls looking so fine, so fine

All the time that she try to catch my eye
Now I hear that she's crushing on another guy
Why do we always want what we can't have oh oh oh oh

I never really wanted, never really wanted that girl
I never really wanted , wanted her in my world
I never really wanted that girl over now I do

I never noticed how
A woman's eyes can dance
But from the outside in looks like the dancing for him
Leads me wondering, wondering
Why isn't now I see her in a different light
If I could turn back time I would tonight

Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun

Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said
He's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself no matter what they say
Be yourself no matter what they say

Eric Reed,"Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list

I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere

Eric Reed,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around

We pray some, and sin some

Whatever else I may do
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through
I'll never stop wanting you
And when forever is through
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes
Of this I'm more than just sure
My love will last and endure
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Lead me on, let me stand
I am tired
I am weak
I am warm

Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear'
Precious Lord, linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand, precious lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears, and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
Let the river, where I stand, guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand, precious lord, lead me home
Take my hand, precious lord, lead me home",Precious Lord Take My Hand
Eric Reed,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song

Eric Reed,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Eric Reed,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?
Eric Revis,"Where's that careless chambermaid?
Where'd she put my razor blade?
She mislaid it, I'm afraid,
It's gotta be foun'!
Ask her when she cleaned my room
What she did with my perfume;
I just can't lose it,
I've gotta use it,
'Cause Lulu's back in town.

Gotta get my old tuxedo pressed,
Gotta sew a button on my vest,
'Cause tonight I've gotta look my best,
Lulu's back in town.
Gotta get a half a buck somewhere,
Gotta shine my shoes and slick my hair,
Gotta get myself a boutonniere,
Lulu's back in town.
You can tell all my pets,
All my Harlem coquettes;
Mister Otis regrets
That he won't be aroun'.
You can tell the mailman not to call,
I ain't comin' home until the fall,
And I might not get back home at all,
Lulu's back in town.

You can bet I've got it bad,
Best complaint I've ever had;
We'll be stepping out tonight,
An' struttin', an' how.
We're in for the swellest time,
Finish up without a dime;
Look here, you fellers,
I'll make you jealous,
My Lulu, she's a wow.
