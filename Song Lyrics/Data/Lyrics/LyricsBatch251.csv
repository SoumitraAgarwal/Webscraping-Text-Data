Kitty Wells,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come

T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace
Kitty Wells,"Death is an angel sent down from above sent for the buds and the flowers we love
Truly 'tis so for in heaven's own way each soul is a flower in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet beautiful flowers that will never decay
Gathered by angels and carried away forever to bloom in the Master's bouquet
[ ac.guitar ]
Loved ones are passing each day and each hour passing away as the life of a flower
But every bud and each blossom some day
Will bloom as the flowers in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers...
[ organ ]
Let us be faithful till life's work is done blooming with love till the reaper shall come
Then we'll be gathered together for age
Transplanted to bloom in the Master's bouquet
Gathering flowers...

For the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there

Kitty Wells,"I'm only human I'm just a man
Help me to believe in what I could be and all that I am
Show me the stairway that I have to climb
Lord for my sake teach me to take one day at a time
One day at a time sweet Jesus that's all I'm asking from you
Give me the strength to do everyday what I have to do
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus and tomorrow may never be mine
So for my sake teach me to take one day at a time
Do you remember when you walked among men
Well Jesus you know if you're looking below it's worse now than then
Pushing and shoving crowding my mind
So for my sake teach me to take one day at a time
One day at a time...
Yes just for my sake teach me to take one day at a time",One Day at a Time
Kitty Wells,"One by one we've broke each vow we made
It was you who lied it was me who paid
As sure as there's a heaven beyond the sun we'll pay for our lies one by one
My plans and hopes have tumbled down my castle of dreams plunged to the ground

How can you face me after what you've done
You've shattered my dreams one by one
One by one...

How can you go to sleep at night don't know mem'ries make you long for daylight
You'll pay the price after having your fun you'll regret each mistake one by one
The love I treasured you sold for gold and then you left me cold
You're happy now but the time will come your false love will lead you one by one
One by one...",One by One [With Red Foley]
Kitty Wells,"You and me together life's a pleasure
But without your love I'd want to flee
And I feel the same about you darling
We belong together you and me
We'll share loves' joy and life's sorrow
You belong to me I belong to you
When you hold my hand 
The sun shines brighter
When you smile at me, I lose my blues
Don't ever let nothing come between us
Think how lonely life apart would be
Gossiping tongues can never change me darling
Your love means more than life to me",You and Me [With Red Foley]
Kitty Wells,"I'm that old German's daughter
Far across deep, blue water
I still live by the old river Rhine
Where you loved me and told me
That you loved me only
You called me your pretty Fraulein

[Chorus:]
If there's a doubt in your mind
I'm still your Fraulein
And each night as the moon starts to shine
Where you once held my hand
I go there and stand
I'll always be your Fraulein

As the stars shine above me
They tell me a story
Of our love that was so divine
As we walked by the river
The two of us together
You called me your pretty Fraulein

Kitty Wells,"All these many years I've loved you
No one has ever known,
No one has ever known but you alone.
I've kept it locked inside my heart
And smiled through all my tears,
My darling I have loved you,
Oh so many years.

Each night within my lonely room
I cried dear over you,
And prayed to God that things would turn out right.
But when the dawn of day appears
I brush away my tears,
My darling I have loved you,
Oh so many years.

I'll go on pretending that my life is all so gay,
And happy dear without you by my side,
When all the time my heart is longing
Just to have you near,
My darling I have loved you,
Oh so many years.

Maybe fate will lead us down a path
Where we will meet again,
And then we'll both be free to love anew.
Then one sweet kiss from your dear lips
Will banish all my fears,
My darling I have loved you,
Oh so many years.",Oh! So Many Years

Than to run around all over town with somebody new
I'd rather stay home, forgotten and blue
Than to look for fun with anyone but you

Kitty Wells,"Friends, my name is Ferlin Husky.
I'd like to tell you 'bout a man that let alcohol 
destroy everything that God gave him

I saw an accident one day that would chill the heart of any man
It would teach them not to drink a drop 
While the steering wheel's in their hand

This awful accident occurred on the 20th day of May
And caused two little children to be sleepin' beneath the clay
These two little kids walked side by side along the state highway
Their poor old mother, she had died
And their daddy had ran away

As these two little children walked arm in arm
How sad their hearts did feel
When around the curb came a speeding car
With a drunk man at the wheel
The drunk man saw the little kids
And he hollered a drunked sound
""Get out of the road you little fools""
And the car, it brought them down

The bumper struck the little girl, takin' her life away
While the little boy, in a puddle of blood
In the ditch, lyin' there did lay
The drunk man staggered from his car 
To see the damage that he had done
And then he let out a yell you could hear for miles
When he recognized his dyin' son

Such mournin' from a drunken man, I've never heard before
While kneeling down by his car he prayed to heavens door
Sayin', ""Oh God, please forgive me for this awful crime I've done""
And his attention then was called away 
By the words of his dyin' son
He said, ""Daddy, why did you do this to us
How come you run us to the ground?
It was you and Mummy we were talkin' about, 
When the car, it brought us down
And I was just tellin' little sister
That I knew we'd see you again someday
But, Daddy, why did it have to be this way
Why did it",Drunken' Driver
Kitty Wells,"Since you've gone
The moon, the sun, the stars in the sky
Know the reason why I cry
Love divine once was mine
Now you've gone

Since you've gone
My heart, my lips, my tear-dimmed eyes
A lonely soul within me cries
I acted smart, broke your heart
Now you've gone

Oh, what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted
I was wrong; now you've gone

Oh,  what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted
I was wrong; now you've gone",Gone
Kitty Wells,"I was out on the West Coast, tryin' to make a buck
And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town

Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down

I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm

At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309

I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309

Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road

Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight

Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white

Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago

At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel

Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309

But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by
And like you, Big Joe'll give 'em a ride
Here, have another cup and forget about the dime
Keep it as a souvenir, from Big Joe and Phantom 309",Phantom 309
Kitty Wells,"I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Trying to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin' away on Channel 1-9
When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line

And he said, ""Breaker 1-9, is anyone there?
Come on back truckers and talk to Teddy Bear""
I keyed the mike and I said, ""You got it, Teddy Bear""
And the little boy's voice came back on the air

""Appreciate the breaker who we got on that end""
I told him my handle and then he began
""Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air""

But you see, I get lonely and it helps to talk
'Cause that's about all I can do, I'm crippled and I can't walk
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
And I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked

""This was my dad's radio"", the little boy said
But I guess it's mine and mom's now 'cause my daddy's dead
Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was tryin' to get home in a blinding snow

Mom has to work now to make ends meet
And I'm not much help with my two crippled feet
She says not to worry that we'll make it alright
But I hear her cryin' sometimes late at night

You know there's one thing I want more than anything else to see
Oh, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me
But you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
But I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone

Not one breaker came on the old CB
As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville town

Dad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year
Why I remember him sayin' someday
This old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear
But I know now I'll never get a ride on 18-wheeler again
But this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends

Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But you give me shout when you're passin' through
And I'll surely be happy to come back to you

Well, I came back and I said before you go 10-10
What's your home twenty, little CB friend
He gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait

I turned that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street two two nine
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one the heck of a shock
Eighteen-wheeler were lined up for three city blocks

I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
And that little crippled boy was havin' a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again

Well, you better believe I took my turn rifin' Teddy Bear
And then carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy, if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man

We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone
He shook my hand with a mile long grin
And said, ""So long trucker, I'll catch you again""
Ah, I hit that interstate with tears in my eyes

I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
Breaker 1-9 came the voice on the air
Just one word of thanks from mama, Teddy Bear
We wish each and everyone a special prayer for you
Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now before I start to cry
May God ride with you 10-4 and goodbye",Teddy Bear
Kitty White,"If you were mine
I could be a ruler of kings
And if you were mine
I could do such wonderful things

I'd say to a star
Stop where you are
Light up my lover's way
And every star above you

Would obey, say
If you were mine
I would live for your love alone
To kneel at your shrine
I would give up all that I own

Yes even my heart
Even my life
I'd trade it all for you
And think I was lucky too
If you were mine",If You Were Mine
Kitty White,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When

Kiuas,"From far beyond the mountains of Crom
Where the forces of winter spare only the strong
Strides forth a son of the north
Destined to conquer, and die by the sword

And like the sun, he rises with golden light
Reaching with his rays into the world
But like the sun, each time he's destined to set
And is forced to hide in the dark...

Where his wounds bleed in silence
Blazing eyes now reduced to dying embers
""Oh, black winged goddess,
You've struck me again with lust, please stop the bleeding -
You've taken enough!""

Across the earth he strides,
And when he strikes he always triumphs
Still he never forgets the shadow of the goddess,
Haunting his steps

And like the moon, his restless eyes shine in the night
Joining the orgy of the stars
But like the moon, his full heart is destined to wane
And is forced to hide in the dark",Black Winged Goddess
Kiuas,"The reigning king, high priest of the sonic fire
Baptizing the world with a roaring flame
Lord of the strings
Born to sweep the world like a fifth wind
Now gone, but echoing beyond forever

Burning with passion and with grace
Every night you set the world ablaze
Millions who walked with you through the days
Forever will revere your name
Electric fire from your hands
Burned still on the night your last stand
Breathing life into the world

On the last stage lies a hero with a heart of gold
Now a fallen warrior with wounds too deep to endure the cold
Your strings still weep as you're taken away too soon
As you bleed on the strings now the strings bleed with you

Drag you again into the cold

Hear the call to arms
Our future's been forged somewhere on the anvils of the gods,
Time for the first strike to land!

Exploiting your weakness
Cast aside your fears, raise your sword!

So alone

As I realize
I don't care
All I know is
That I'll soon be there

Now it's gone

Another dawn
Has come and gone

Given through your commitments
Fighting against is a waste of your time

Still on my tippy toes 
You know I should have left you baby

I sat there on my doorstep baby 
Crying in the rain 
But oh the crazy dream 

I watched my tears run down the drain 
She's a boomerang 
Keep comin' back to me 
She's a boomerang 
Keep comin' back to me 
You know sometimes you're just so damned hard to please 
If I give my heart away 

Would it break these chains 
If I cried a million tears 
Would it drown the flame 
You know you set my soul on fire 
But there's nothing left to burn nothing left to burn 
You're just a boomerang 
Throw it out watch it turn turn 
Boom boom boom boomerang

Don't stop me now leave me alone 
I like playin' in the street 
We came here to make some noise 
Hey - Better watch these dirty boys

Throw your coat on the floor
And lock the door

A red hot devil in an angels cloud 
Her finger tips got the magic touch 
She'll shake her hips and make a blind man blush

Parked in the back seat of my car

My baby ain’t coming back 
Got a one way ticket on a one way track 
My baby she’s a hot tamale 
My baby‘s burning up the road 
My baby done flipped me the bird 
No matter what you heard she ain’t coming back no

Nothing left but a cloud of dust and 
Tire tracks through the whole front yard 
She might think I’m coming back to chase her 
But she ain’t worth the miles I’d put on my car 
Might be out in Oklahoma, maybe down in Arkansas 
Maybe up in Ohio, what she don’t know 
It don’t hurt at all, y’all

No matter what you heard she ain’t coming back no

I heard a hemi coming up the driveway 
Thinking maybe she’s back tonight 
It’s just the boys headed for the pool hall 

Sometimes things just work out right

Living with the hammer down,

Kix Brooks,"I was leanin’ on the bar with a glass half empty 
Washin’ off the dust when she brushed up against me 
She was soft and pretty everything that I’m not 
She said you look lonesome 
I said yeah I get that a lot

She knew I was a cowboy 
I was born headed west 
She knew I was a cowboy 
When we met

I had mud on my boots and my hat stained with sweat 
Lines on my face and miles of regret 
But my silver belt buckle still caught her eye 
The only thing I’ve got that still got its shine

Yeah she knew I was a cowboy 
A long shot at best 
But she knew I was a cowboy when we met

She had a mind made up both hands on the wheels 
Her bags in the back of that old Oldsmobile 
Left her tears on the pocket of my pearl button shirt 
I whispered I loved her 
But I don’t think she heard

But she knew I was a cowboy 
Not what she needed I guess but she knew I was a cowboy

Told me she was sweet on me 
And she said I’ve got something 
That I think you might like to see 
I got a little peek driving in my car 
And she finally let me see it out behind the bar 
She said her daddy’d kill us both if he ever knew 
I’m talking ‘bout my baby’s tattoo

If you ever get to see it 
Well, you’re gonna want to see it again 
And it looks a little different just depending on the way she bends 
But it’s the cutest little thing that I’ve ever seen 
On a model in a movie or a magazine 
Funny how some ink’ll make you think 
There’s nothing she won’t do 
I’m talking ‘bout my baby’s tattoo

Ooo ooo looks so good 
Makes me crazy 
Baby tell me what would 
Make a sweet thing like you get a thing like that 
(what were you thinking) 
Couple crazy girlfriends out on a dare 
Drinking margaritas like they just don’t care 
Next thing you know well you’re sitting in a chair 
And trying to remember what he’s drawing down there 
(oh nooo)

I can’t tell you what it looks like 
I can’t tell you where it is 
And chances are you’re never gonna see it so I’ll tell you this 
It’s not a rose on her ankle, not a heart on her hand 
But it’ll put a smile on the face of any man 
The kind of thing that’ll still look hot when she’s 92

I beg your pardon the 52 is strictly parting
Emcees like I'm Moses
No matter what your coast is
No matter what your flow is
No matter who's the dopest

I shake dust from opposers
Get your open like roses
Burning microphone holders
Assembling all the soldiers
Open your current orders
I'm attacking tape recorders while I'm holding down this fortress

Enter into the paradise and all his glory (Man!)

If you want to k now me, say me be coming on top of the clouds (Boom)

it's hard to be a star when your skills ain't up to par
It's hard to push a Lex when you don't even own a car
It's hard to win the batten when you can't win this war
It's hard to be a man when you don't know who you are
I stay on point just like some harpoons
Develop thoughts in verbal dark rooms taking on these cartoons
Ya minds spinning like some typhoons
These martial artists flip scripts to leave ya open like some gaping wounds
Call me 52 this predator
My microphone's like Excalibur attacking y'all with metaphors
So my competitors can now check ya exit doors
Choice is yours Jesus reigns like when it pours
The Lord God Most High superior
These haters lay up in this cut like bacteria
I'm never fearing ya I see through exteriors
I keep on scoping out these moves from ulterior
Stay devoted still checking all ya motives
Thoughts unloaded though so many times I'm misquoted
So now it's noted these origins of residence
So my adversaries can now make they exodus
'cause it's my nemesis escorted off the premises
There ain't no guessing this when I proceed to finish this
52 the chemicist head seeking lyricist
Standing with my locust fist now I got ya choking this
But your broker diss got lost with ya hopelessness
But from genesis I'll still stand opposing this
Smack it up, if they last name is skills ya first name should be lack of
It's time to act up or call in your back up
These fools make me crack up
Fronting is what you have a knack of
You talk your junk but then you come around to give me mad love
Whatever, I gots no time for you
So go ahead and spend time with your crab crew

Talking:
Yo, yo what's up yo?
Yo, what's up man?
Yo, y'all are GRITS right?-yeah man
Yo, I-I want to get into this gospel rap thing man.
Aw, sh man it's a task
Yo I was just wonderin' if I could give you this rhyme I wrote
Go ahead man, I ain't hatin'. Go ahead yo


It's all about me, me, and did I mention me
I'm the dopest rapper in the gospel rap industry
I kill more white rappers than snipers
I'm the one they call to get the crowd hyper
Yo, all y'all cats need to retire
With your played out raps, I'm the roughest and toughest
I love the spotlight yo you better make sure this mike sounds right
Or I'll charge you double on this honorarium
Don't ask me to speak words of encouragement cause yo I got the dopest skills
Don't ask me to do what God wills,
It's all about keepin' it real and makin' sure I get me a fat type of record deal
Give the crowd something they can feel
Toss God a bone every once in a while, have a Coke and a smile
Yo, I been doin' this a long while, man, like two months even
So what if I look like a heathen, I can still kill the ruckus demon
I got all the girls fiendin' , I put emcee back into emceeing
Yo God and hip-hop versus the god of hip-hop I believe in
I'm acheivin' what I want. These skills is what I flaunt
Yo you caint get me so tell me what you got.
Man, I live and die for the god of hip-hop, I mean God and hip-hop
So y'all fools need to stop

CHORUS
This is a message to you rap infants,
Showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills but skill alone don't get you props
It takes integrity, when rappin' for Christ on microphones

Who's this Babylon emcee with the audacity, approaching me
As if I got a stamp of approval for his fallacy
I hear you talkin' 'bout yourself
And claim you keep it real but I ain't feelin' it
I'm feelin' to your flesh but only kill the little light so dimly shinin'
I question why you rhymin',
Is ministry in mind and does God direct your timin'?
Or do you even put it in to put it out? What you about?
Do you use Him as a jewel well then your crown
And you clout your time will tell
In life He must prevail, a living example is needed to rap it well
You see the ministry begins theminute you step up in from the stage
Is your character the essence of the life you hear in the pages of His very Word
Cause if not face His rage.
You ain't understandin' He demands a higher standard
Stayin' true to hip-hop caint be found in His Commandments
Take notice because the atmosphere is about to get tense
Wanna find relatin' truth to some gone take it offense
Young cats, heed the message of this elder emcee
Who got responsibility to let you know what kind of bilities to key
But it seems that some of y'all ain't caught the vision as we

",It's the S.O.I. (Sons of Intellect Anthem)
KJ-52,"Here's a few things that I like now
Making beats on my mpc
Picking up an underground CD or mix tape
Diggin through record crates
Goldin stay looking for the perfect break to sample and truncate
Raw raps on a raw track
Copping mad timberlands like the mall that you shop at
Combat fatigues a notebook full of rhyme schemes that I keep in my backpack
Anthem of a life rockin the mic
Spending a little time showing love to my wife
The way Christ loved us sacrificed his life
Bore them stripes restoring the life
Doing shows on the stage seeing souls getting saved
Hearing this track being played in your escalade
As you roll through the hood sitting on blades
Cats gonna bug when they hear they mom say

:chorus:
I like the hands up keep ya hands up
Party people in the front I need ya hands up
And when ya hands up leave your hands up
See there's a lot of thing I like but only one thing I love
I like the hands up keep ya hands up
Party people in the front I need ya hands up
And when ya hands up leave your hands up
See there's a lot of thing I like but only one thing I love

I like Saturdays and just waking up late
I like things right away 'cause I don't like to wait
I like tasty cakes, and Philly cheese steaks
And the Tampa bay Bucs and Miami hurricanes (whuuuut...)
Now I like my shoes clean with a fresh pair of jeans
And some rice and some beans and a box of krispy kremes
I like Mt. Dew 'cause I like the caffeine
And the pistons and wolverines is my sports teams
I like the Double-Double at the In and Out Burger
But I don't like McDonalds they always mess up my order
I like my man Spongebob and Homestar Runner
I like flip flops and tank tops in the summer
I like to make goofy faces when I smile for the camera
I like to rock old school hip hop and mc hammer
I like Xbox clean socks I like Canada
But there's one thing I want and this is what I'm asking ya

Repeat Chorus

I love the way that God just takes a man
And then changes him gives him strength to stand
I love when the world says I ain't got a chance
See I'm loving that you're the one that tells me I can
I love the fact that you just loved me first
You erased my past and freed me from the curse
And even at the times when I just act my worse
I love that ya take me back that I don't deserve
I love every time I open your word
That I see in every line every chapter and verse
That your love made you die and that love that occurred
It left you crucified 'cause your love for the world
And I love how you just love me so much
I love how you provide just more than enough
And with the rhyme that I say now that I bust
See I like a lot of things but you're the one I love

Repeat Chorus



",This Is Love
KJ-52,"Intro:
SOI
Beat mot
Game on it
Where ya at
Old school
I'ma take you way back
Waaaay back
Yo Yo
As it goes a little something like this


Verse One:
Yo it's the K to the J, J to the five
Five to the two, it's time to get live
Party people in the house if you're feeling all right
Throw your hands in the air wave them side to side
You can dip dip dive you can socialize
You can lime to the lemon, you can lemon to the lime
But nine years ago a friend of mine
Hit me up just to ask the time
I'm looking at my watch it said quarter to twelve
He shook his head, he had something to tell
He said ""Check it my brother now it's plain to see
I'm going to make it plain just as plain can be""
'cause you her and you there
But a life without Christ ain't going nowhere
And I was just like you I was jamming on it
Then he sang a little song a little something like this hit it...

Chorus:
We rock the mic in a different way
Just two turntables and a fresh DJ
Party people in the house are you feeling OK
Then let the record play all night all day (repeat)

Verse Two:
Stop a second I need to hear more
He said ""I came through the door and I said it before""
But you didn't listen to me this first time
So open your mind and let me open your eyes
'cause the blind lead the blind can't you see that my brother
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
You going under and you blind to the facts
It ain't where you from and it ain't where you at
It ain't the radio, Cazals or Kangol hat
Now you be illing and it's like that
Your life's wack just broken pieces
You got Adidas but you ain't got Jesus
And a hotel, a motel or a holiday inn
Now it don't mean nothing 'cause your life keeps fronting
And you still lost in sin
I said a hotel, a motel, or a holiday inn
Now it don't mean nothing 'cause your life keeps fronting
And you still lost in sin help me say it like...

Chorus: 4x

Verse Three:
I ain't no joke 'cause your life's broke
But now I'm glad that we spoke,
'cause pretty soon you choke
And everything you see is goin' up in smoke
So what's your hope you gonna sink or float
One day you croke and one thing I'll tell
You goanna rock the bells all the way to hell
And all the ball is shot
God is making paper
All the players you goanna catch babies
La-de da-de, who likes to party
You think you the man but you really ain't nobody (what?)
It was the lamb who was led to the slaughter
Rolls beneath me the planet rock like bam-botta
The one who owns the play just like the car-da
The one who is the spirit, son and the father
The one who's eyes last sea and the water
God's son we welcome back like carter

Chorus: 4x

All night all day, all night all day,
Yeah, fresh, for 2000
You sucker (Hah)

KJ-52,"Hey yo, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah
'cause I'm alone, I need a friend
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
I'll tell you what, do this
Make sure the hook is on there
And just record whatever I do, alright?
Alright KJ, yo, it's the KJ 5 to frickity 2
S O I, you know what I'm saying? Silas repeat this

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Sick of sticking out my neck to get me burned like a Bic lighter
Sick of all the Jim Carey type 'Liar Liar'
So I'm sticking to get a grip like some hand pliers

My manifesto, hit you the best flow
Hide behind the mics like you was stinkin' death row
I'm already seeing through you like some windows
Stay on you like halo, shine like day glow

Trying to be the professional using amateur
You couldn't get the picture even with a camera
My stamina, this program is strictly slamming ya
You ducking like some draft dodgers heading to Canada

I gotta hand it to you, you know how to break me down
Judas' kisses never seem to ever make a sound
But thanking God that was not from the lost and found
But keep in mind that what goes around comes around

I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
'cause I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel

Yo, what's up man? How you doing?
Yo, remember me? Yo, we go way back
W-w-what do you mean you don't remember me? What?

Hello, how you doing? What? You don't remember me?
Love turns to hate, friends turn to enemies
Homies turn to phonies, haters turn to cronies
As the world turns, I'm still standing lonely

There's only one love that never turning cold
Always got my back when I got played like a Casanova
Always had a dry shoulder just to cry on
And always made a way through the dark with a light on

I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
'cause I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel

I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
'cause I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel

Hey yo, Dark, now tell me what's up?
Why you always seem to got beef like ground chuck?
We used to cool, but I guess, I'm out of luck
Would you mind taking the knife out of my back it go stuck?

It's the Christ Jesus putting back all the pieces
His love runs the deepest, now close to ever peaces
Tosses sin as far as Wests to the Easts
Never truly alone, with the love that he releases

I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
'cause I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel

I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel

KJ-52,"Let me busta a rhyme tell a story like Slick Rick
And put a sermon like eric in ya ear like a qtip
Now it's common sense that Ja Rules
But I'm a tell you about Jesus who's the leader of the new school
You thinking you's cool you emcees is lost boys
Got no cash money you juvenile like some hot boys
I drop noise when I let the sound blast
And tell Big Boy Andre about Jesus Christ the outcast
Here's the deal I feel it's now time to be Real
Christ died on Calvary not on Cypress Hill
It don't matter even if your slim or if your shady
JayHova reigns supreme but his name ain't' Jay z
And it's mos def that the Mobb was deep
That hung the Son of Man who died just to bring back the lost sheep
On all streets all peeps naughty by nature
Whether you biggie or small you can know the living Savior now..
(OLD SCHOOL)
Let me take you back to the old school
And tell you about the Fresh Prince of Peace now who just cold rules
We keep it nice and smooth Rakim like Eric be
And run â??Dâ?? emcees to show our biz like AG
See I'm down with two live crews full of fat boys
And even though we young emcees now we can't avoid
The one who everlasts reigns as the lamb slain
Just for you and I Jesus went to the House of Pain
You can be the Black Sheep but Christ reigns supreme
Drink ya Ice T with some vanilla Ice Cream
Don't matter to me be the Public Enemy
He'll still make your sin disappear like he's Whodini
In this biz I put his name on the Markie
That's why I'm calling out these names when I emcee
(DIRTY SOUTH)
Check it now you can bounce with me
No limit to my God like Master P
What audacity it's quite ludacris actually
To think you could trick your daddy
God the father sees everything naturally
You can't fool him I'm like woah nelly
He'll put bone thugs back in harmony
It ain't hard to see just what he's done for me
I knew a guy named Bubba who'd spark the place
He was little like Wayne and had a scarface
But now this cat done changed his ways
Talking how he's saved from amazing grace
Understand that Christ had to â??Câ?? murder
So you and I when we die live forever

KJ-52,"Who am I? The one that gets laced tight
The one you wear, hit a flare on the same night
That you hit an uprock, I'm the one in the closet next to one sock
The one you rock on the cardboard box
Walking to the one block
You know the one spot peeps get the one shot
Got one thought on the task at hand
You can ask your man I'm part of master plan
Only be	-boys and be	-girls, they understand
Whatever you say now, ya wish is my command
Name it, I'll be the footwork to your head spin
Follow your lead, go anyplace that ya legs bend
At ya cipher session I'm ya best friend
I got a twin, we's a pair clocking size 10
Head's a shell, three stripes on side
Laces large, on your feets I reside
Keep me clean, keep me laced, and I'll be alright
I be the first element up in here tonight

Who am I?  See, I'm the one that you be gripping tight
The one that makes you sound real good when you be flipping right
And I'm the one causing fights up at the open mic
I'll make ya sound real stupid if you don't hold me right
I got emcees fiending for me all day and night
I could care less if ya on me if ya black or white
See all that matters when you rock me don't be coming wack and
Don't hold me to the speaker or I'ma feedback and
I'm used for rapping, every now and the used for passing
Back and forth in ya crew in a freestyle fashion
I get rocked, ripped, flipped on and blasted, 
I'm spoke on, choke on, hit on, spit on, and mastered
I've outlasted, been used to tell truth and lies
Used to kill the youth and used to open up they eyes
I come in all kinds of sizes, heard all kinds of voices
Sometimes I'm plugged in, you know sometimes I'm cordless
Keep me clear, keep me close, and I'll be alright
See I'm the second element up in here tonight

Who am I?  I got two heads and they always spinning
I got two arms that the deejays, they use for ripping
Plus a fader in my middle that they always gripping
I'm completed with the two records used for mixing
They pulling tricks and cutting up, ya know they scratching
Remixing beat, juggling just whie they mix and match and
All kinds of beats till it's the heat that I know ya catching
And I'm the one that started hip-hop in case ya asking
I got knobs and faders in a mad abundance
I come in many names, but most time it's 1200
When I get played now, you know that you truly love it
Now clean the needle on my arm or I'll be sounding busted
I'm disregarded, treated like I ain't legitimate
I'm making music, you don't see me as an instrument
And it takes true skills to get on me and be ripping it
Nobody sees my contribution, they ain't getting it
You know there's one thing that really now makes me mad
You used to blow me off but now I'm the latest fad
I'm the thing that every rock band they got's to have
Now people say my name and they be like ""Now what is that?""
Keep me running, keep me spinning, and I'll be allright
I'll be the third element up in here tonight

Who am I?  Se I'm hiding in your backpack
You tear my tip off, replace it with a fat cap
I'm 12 oz. of steel concealed in a knapsack
Ya pull me out, ya shake me up, and then attack that
Wall or train while ya steady throwing up your name
Leaving these end to end burners, ya getting ghetto fame
Now me and my brothers, ya know we come in many colors
Steady beautifying the walls of a ghetto culture
Toys and suckers now you know they getting dissed quick
I'm going all city all up in ya district
Ya hold me with control so I never drip thick
I'm tagging up ya spot, nobody misses it
See I'm the brush to a modern day type DiVinci
I'm the new urban renewal for ya block's committee
I've spoken words of the youth of an inner city
I'm vandalism but to others I'll be called graffiti
Keep me shaking, keep me spraying, and I'll be allright
I be the fourth element up in here tonight

Who am I?  See I'm the God that you don't know about
I gave you breath up in your lungs that you can't go without
See you know the facts of My story you been told about
I'm always reaching out for you but you just keep on holding out
I know your doubts, I know you're thinking that I ain't real
See I know you forgot about Me when you got ya last record deal
See I know the way you feel, I walked the earth just like you
And like a child up in his Father's arms, I long to hide you
Many times I invite you while standing here right besides you
But you walk right past, you ignore My hands here given to guide you
I gave you gifts, I gave you talents that you just used to gain your wealth
But you took my gifts and talents only for you, just to glorify yourself
I was beaten and bruised, crushed now for your iniquity
Stripped naked, I was spit upon just for you to live eternally
Yet you blaspheme Me, you make moves without asking Me
Then you blame Me for your troubles and calamities, you kidding me?
Keep Me first, keep Me in your life, and it's gonna be alright

It's the KJ-52 along with the John Reuben
And we steady cooling mic checking one two and
The choice is yours now cause this is what we
Doing
You can get with this cause this for us is life
But if you get with this understand this is
Christ otherwise you other guys get with that
Mr.John Reuben can you tell me where the parties
At?

Alright thanks my friend from the sons of ""In""
We move to the rhythm without wondering
Yahweh comes first all is under him
Take a dope emcee and then double him
And you got two, ok that's me and you
Mr.John are you with the KJ-52
Doing what it takes to light up the ear hole
A lot of energy absolutely no soul

You can get with that or you can get with this
You can get with that or you can get with this

Is that without Christ then the track be empty
So understand simply that we ain't just emcee's
We simply just state that ""Christ has changed me""
Look at us strangely yo it's all the same be	
We don't care now peep the message we send thee
So real swiftly when the enemy tempts me
I'm like ""do da dippity' c'mon

I'm going this and that I write that and this
But if that's not life well then it must be
Dismissed
No time for negative got to be positive
Clear and sincere I think we state the obvious or
Is it?
Cause I found this to be true
So many times I do what I hate to do
Brought back to the fact I'm in need of you
But then again what else is really new?

You can get with that or you can get with this
You can get with that or you can get with this
You can get with that or you can get with this
You can get with this cause this is what it is

Party peoples feeling fine
If your life goes off the track
Pick it up pick it up pick it up!
Ya back on the scene crispy and clean
You can get with that plus the gat and cream
Or you can get with this and let Christ reign
Supreme
But now the choice is still yours can you see
What I mean?
You see we seek like in abundance
All right Yahweh came through and then gave me
Substance
Overflowing we let it spill on the mic
Embrace the truth and then we keep it focused
Right
Despite obstacles can't let it sway me
Even though at times my vision get hazy
I say we stay on the path that leads to life
No matter how narrow we can't lose sight..

Dear Slim, I never wrote you or been calling
My name ain't Stan son nah we've never met and
My name's KJ let me begin by introducing now
Myself to you and these very reasons I'll be writing
Why I took my time the who what where and why and
The purpose of my verse and the reasons I'm reciting
What I hope your learning from the truth I pray your finding
And every word I'm writing down upon the dotted lines and
See I heard ya first album it was called infinite
I shook my head cause nowadays you sounding different
What drove ya to take your whole persona and be flipping it
Now what makes a man totally change see I ain't getting it
See was you sick of getting booed when you was ripping it
And sick of never having dough and you wanted to put an end to it
What good's all kinds of dough, plus all kinds of flow?
To gain a world of fans but suffer the loss of soul

[Chorus - 4X]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la (to whom it may concern)

[Verse II]
Dear Slim I never wrote you or been calling
This is my 2nd letter cause see son I gots a real problem
It's that to you that I'm always catching these comparisons
And after shows I got these people coming up to me saying
You sound like Slim Shady son you sound like Eminem
And I be like now really man do I gots to go through this again
See I used to get mad and sick of people saying that
Till at this one show this one day I met this one cat
He told me how he used to listen to you but now listens to me
Had your LP but threw it out and bought my CD
I'm like ""For real?"" he's like ""Yeah,"" said my music made a difference
It got him away from all your words and images
Gotta mention this now what about the effects you have on kids?
You ever stop to think about the millions you influence
Or is it just irrelevant is it a true life you telling it
Or just a way for some record companies selling it
The only thing we's got in common is our melanin
Or a lack of it but anyway now this is what I'm saying
Its for you that I'm on my knees now daily praying
Praying that God opens your eyes now to what I'm relaying
Now I'm praying that it's your heart that will soon be changing
Praying one day that you'll be calling upon his name and
But anyway I'm signing off now don't keep me waiting
This is KJ another cat just trying to make it

[Chorus]

[Verse III]
Dear Slim I heard about the stuff you's going through
See I could relate to you cause son I'm about as old as you
See we both know what it's like just to be growing up to be in a neighborhood
When you's the one and only kid that's white
Or to get booed when you on the mic just because your skin is light
It ain't right but sometimes you know that's life
But really tell me what you do?
You just push on with hopes on that someday you'll put on your crew
I hope you understand that I ain't even dissing you
And even though it's a song you'll probably never listen to
See what I send to you is this
Is that a life without Christ is just a life that is never fixed
I hope you remember this now a few sentences
About a living God who loves you and plus forgives
And I'll be praying for your ex-wife and plus your kid
It's hard to live in a world as crazy as this one is
And even though now it really might sound redundant
God's got mad love for you up in a mad abundance
You'll sell a couple mill I'll probably sell a couple hundred
There's more to life than selling records and just getting blunted
But anyway that's really all I gots to say
Just another word from an emcee now around the way
Maybe some day we meet each other in some way
Till then one love one God one way

Heard the sound pop and then I just thought

Ruler of the universe the name above every name

But what I think is that y'all heads is just too picky
So I don't care if ya crews with me
Cause I'll be first to try something that you be thinking is too risky
Go ahead and talk smack go ahead and diss me
I'm a keep going just where I feel God's lead me
And I'm a do that now even if you ain't with me

would you dance with me, 
my darling would you please take a chance with me, 
I see you over there with the jocks, 
I see you over there with the rich boys, 
I see you over there with all the pretty girls, 
and I'm asking one thing... 

I grew up in Inglewood a little brown boy 
had straight hair and I rocked corduroy 
walked down Venice way in my own way 
wasn't very popular with the girls in 5th grade 
they used to call me nerd 
that was even if they used to call me at all 
across the school hall I put my head and thought 
what could I do to pursue and fought 
in my own mind was a struggle of sorts 
school was a game and I was off court 
on the bench and the coach wouldn't let me off once 
I sat in the corner of the yard like a dunce 
and all I ever wanted was the girl to have lunch 
maybe in the cafeteria with some punch 
but it didn't happen I didn't have heart 
cause I knew how it would end from the start and then I asked... 

Would you please,
would you dance with me, 
my darling would you please take a chance with me, 
I see you over there with the jocks, 
I see you over there with the rich boys, 
I see you over there with all the pretty girls, 
and I'm asking one thing...  

when I was growing up it was hard to be happy 
kids knock the books out my hand and make fun of my acne (exactly) 
give me a wedgie while they throw spitballs at me 
and stuff me in my own locker and laugh at me 
(ahhhh ha..) oh you think that's real funny 
cause I'm 5 foot with huge feet and I dress crummy 
and all the school bullies want to just take my lunch money 
c'mon man I only got a dollar twenty 
ya know ya life is just really sad man 
when you play dodge ball your picked as the last man 
and ya run as fast as ya can just like a mad man 
cause the football team wants to throw you in the trash can 
so really will this madness ever end 
really will the nerd ever get revenge? 
will this girl call me back at around ten? 
will you go out w/ me? I just want to be friends 

Would you please,
would you dance with me, 
my darling would you please take a chance with me, 
I see you over there with the jocks, 
I see you over there with the rich boys, 
I see you over there with all the pretty girls, 
and I'm asking one thing...  

Now days I'm a little older plus a little bolder 
but it seems like I just can't get over 
you ever have a day where nothing goes right 
well that just seems to be the story of my whole entire life 
so anybody out there know what I mean? 
to feel like your third string on a football team? 
and ya never ever gonna reach any of your dreams? 
and your only hope is making onion rings at burger king 
but now a days a lot of things done changed 
since Christ came into my life now and just rearranged 
the way I look at myself son it ain't the same 
I drive in a whole ‘nother lane going against the grain 
I know it might just seem a little strange 
the fact remains I changed when I called on his name 
so call me a nerd call me lame it don't matter to me 
see all I need to know is that my wife will dance with me 

Would you please,
would you dance with me, 
my darling would you please take a chance with me, 
I see you over there with the jocks, 
I see you over there with the rich boys, 
I see you over there with all the pretty girls, 
and I'm asking one thing...",Revenge of the Nerds

Rise up lift ya eyes up 
get up stand up throw ya hands up and.. 

Verse 1:
sick of all the lies sick of the compromise 
sick of the way we live our lives and run and hide 
sick of the times we turn our head close our eyes 
can you hear the cries when you gonna rise? 
stand up! my people in the place where you at? 
stand up! God's people who ain't ashamed where you at? 
stand up! if you say you know his name where you at? 
stand up! cause you gotta proclaim what you have 
rise up! no more hiding no time for crying 
you can't be the light of the world when you ain't shining 
I'm straight rhyming so you'll be straight recognizing 
you ain't trying you just sitting there straight whining 
while the whole world around you just straight dying 
so keep in mind Jesus Lion of Zion 
gave his life so you and I wouldn't be frying 
so quit hiding it's time for you to start rising

Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know 

Verse 1:
Hey yo I'm gazing at the skyline watching sun shine 
let my mind unwind and rewinding to the time when my eyes was blind 
see the pride I hid behind it just killed my mind 
but left me thinking I was fine but really I couldn't see the signs 
when all that time your son is shining on me 
it's right above me it's bright and lovely but I just won't see 
I'm running from the son's beams scared of what I don't see 
just while the son be blazing on me because he knows me 
and I can feel the sun shining on my skin 
I run and hide inside close the blinds to keep the son from shining in 
so much time I spend running from the son light's that's peeking in 
I'm weakening and I probably will never see again 
but just then it's a ray of light just blazing bright 
the first time in my life just when my dark night just came to life 
see I'm just the type with all my might to pick a fight 
but for some reason I'm standing here soaking up this light

Chorus:
Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus everywhere that I go 
Your love is my sunshine Jesus this is all that I know 

Verse 2:
The thing about the light of the son is right when he comes 
even if you right in the slums you'll still see the light that he's brung 
ain't a thing existing on this earth without the son's light 
most might ignore the son whenever they live they life 
others want the son to shine but they don't want it bright 
they choose a darker light so they can live they life with darker nights 
but that's a harder life I'd rather just embrace the light 
and blaze the mic cause even the deadest person I seen come to life 
you see the son be shining on my skin and warms me from deep within 
I can't keep it in I got this peace within 
the son of man I made my peace with Him 
that's why you see me grin and every single day you gone see me seeking him 
I got's to speak again about the son who's freeing men 
I'm taking in the son just like the oxygen I'm breathing in 
and my deepest scars the son light be healing them 
I think it's just going to be a sonny day now once again

You said if we hit somebody we're suppose to say sorry
But you never say sorry daddy you yell now
Why did you tell that man that mommy just fell down
Mommy didn't fall down daddy's lying
Mommy why are you always sad and always crying?
Daddy why are you always mad you always fighting?
Why do you always say I'm bad even when I'm trying?
No I don't want to go to my room
I don't want to go to bed now I want to be with you
I don't want to daddy it's to early
I didn't mean it daddy I'm sorry I'm sorry
I promise I'll never say that again
I'm sorry daddy please don't hit me again

What up pops I ain't got to tell you my heart is as hard as a rock
Things have changed since I was the age six
Yet some situations stay the same
Like the way I conceal my pain
Growing up I'd swear my name was every profane thing a man could say
I used to make excuses like you weren't the one that hit her
It was just the liquor in ya
My dad the perfect example of hatred and why am I so bitter?
Ya told me real men don't cry that was a lie
You don't realize what goes on inside of my mind
As time passed my heart ran cold my emotions froze
Lost track of the bruises and the broken bones
Just once wanted to hear that you loved me
Wrap your arms around me and hug me yeah right
Remember the first time I couldnt feel the pain
It was when grandma came and took me to church
Where God relieved the hurt and he knows it took work
But I forgave you he could save you but the question is
Will you let him in it would be such a blessing
To see you as a changed man and holdin my mother's hand
CHORUS



",Where Were You
KJ-52,"HOOK:
Why is it more that things change the more they stay the same?
Why do old people drive slow in the fast lane?
Why is it when I grab the mic you stare at me strange?

Why's every time I eat I get my shirt stained? (dang!)
Wassup Tremaine, what, your name's Wayne?
Dang man, why can't I just remember people's names?
All the same there's a question in my mind
Why do I have to wait in line just to wait in another line
And when I think I'm done I gots to do it one more time?
Why oh why am I always stuck behind
The lady who has writes a check in the express check out line?
Excuse me miss, it's 10 items not 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
Why do most rappers they just spit the same rhymes?
Why do girls go to the bathroom at the same time?
Why when something's wrong I just say I'm fine?
But why ask why when I ask it all the time?

CHORUS:
Why is the grass green? Why's the sky blue?
Why oh why do I do what I do?
Can you please tell me why that is cause I don't have a clue?
Now why is that? I was about to ask you.
Why am I me? and why are you you?
Why do we run in circles chasing after nothing new?
Somebody won't you please tell me why because I haven't got a clue?
Yo why is it my man? I was about to ask you.

(Soulheir the manCHILD)
Why do the voices in my head get louder when I try to sleep?
Why can't I seem to count all the leaping sheep?
I'm knee deep in distribution, retail, paperwork, and e-mail.
Why can't I afford a secretary to handle office detail?
Why are prices high, water wet, people cruel?
Why does every single record exec try to play me for the fool?
Why don't bar stools have backs? Do they want the drunks to fall off?
And why do we have to fill up all the precious silence with small talk?
Why do we all walk with our heads down and walkmans up to ten?
Are we afraid to let a stranger in every now and then?
Why do sucker emcees spit loud and claim to be the hardest
And then sit down to write their rhymes with a dictionary plus a thesaurus?
Why does the commerce strangle art instead of the other way around?
I guess it's hard to work the angles when the cipher's always round.
Why do we drown our sorrow, reach both hands out for tomorrow
When just living today is hard enough to swallow? Why?

CHORUS

(Soulheir the manCHILD)
Why do conceptual song structures cramp my style and hand alike?
Why do organized emcee battles make wack rappers grab the mic?
Why am I here, cause the instruction manual wasn't clear?
Why does my transmission make that sound when I try to shift it's gears?
Why is my stereo so loud? Do I want all neighbors to hear?
Am I my own street team member try to catapult my career?
Why does a dog bark, bee sting, bird sing?
But first things first, why do you burn my album with left hands on your purse string?

(KJ)
Why do we disrespect each other instead of loving one another?
Why do we have to focus on the skin tone and color?
Why can't we see that we sisters and we brothers
And understand we all equal to God and plus He loves us?
Bust this. Ima say this just again and again.
Why oh why can't we all be friends?
But there's one things I just can't comprehend.
Why do they put Braille at a drive-up ATM?
I guess that's for all the car driving blind men.
Why do we just hate God but really love to sin?
Really, man, shouldn't that be just the other way around?
Why do I always have to laugh when somebody falls down?
Why do things get worse when they're already going wrong?
Why's customer service put me on hold for so long?
Why do you tell me to hold on when I'm already holding on?
Why can't we all just get along?

CHORUS

Why does fast food take so long to get it?
Why do people fart in public and say someone else did it?
Why do you ask my opinion but get mad when I give it?
And why ask for wisdom if you ignore the Holy Spirit?
Now check the lyrics cause this might apply to you.
Dude, why's brushing your teeth just like so hard for you?
Now if your breath stank, don't be be saying ""Hi, how are you?""
If I give you a breath mint, don't be like, ""No, thank you.""
Get a clue, now tell me why your clothes is fake, too.

Why do you say it's FUBU when ya know it's PUBU?
And why do you say yes when you really mean no?
Why do you tell me to stop when you really mean go?
Why's the bad choice the one choice I always chose?
But in spite of how I acted, why did God love me so
Much the He would just pay the price of my soul?
But I don't need to ask why. I already know.



",Why
KJ-52,"[KJ-52]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
Before I had status and a two way pager
You could find KJ listenin to hip hop
Blastin it so loud my parents were like ""turn it off""
I used to rock turtlenecks wit Mc Hammer pants
Watch Yo Mtv raps jus to check out the lastest dance
I did the runnin man, they said not bad for a white man
I siad I'm not really white, I jus really need a tan
I used to write the girlies numbers down upon my hand
And I didn't go nowhere wit out my tapes and walkman
Rollin up the bottom of my pants as tight as I can
And I'm up late at night talkin to my girlfriend and

[Chorus]
Back in the day I was so cool [I was so cool]
Back in the day I was so cool [The coolest one in school]
Back in the day I was so cool [Well I can't lie to you]
Back in the day I was so cool [I was a nerdy little dude]

[KJ-52]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I wanted lines in my eyebrows so I took a razor
But I messed up and accidentally I just shaved the
Whole eyebrow off I was like, ""I'm goin crazy""
See it was jus tough jus growin up in the 80's
But for me it was rough cause no girls would ever date me
All the ladies I asked out was like... ""well, maybe""
You're okay, but you're no Patrick Swayze
Unfortunately I think that all my teachers hated me
Cause I sit in the back makin noises like I'm crazy
Ahhh... but its all gravvy
In third period today I asked out this lady
Got the paper out got the pencil now whoops here I go
Will you go out wit me, check yes or no
I'm feelin all slick when I handed her the note
I told you 10 times already no, now leave me alone

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I was only fifteen when I jus met my Savior
And he came in straight in my heart and jus changed the
Way the used to live in all my ill behavior
See its amazin to see my life that I jus gave ya
So amazin to me Jeus Christ you became the
Savior to me and I ain't never been the same the
Way I would be back in the day it would amaze ya
But the change  that I see it was done in a major
Way that would be so that all I can do is thank ya
And everydat jus for me is a new day to praise ya
Cause you came jus to be all I need and you jus made a way for
Me too see so I broke it down for you
Now Ima take ya back in the day kind of like this dude..

Now I was jus walkin through cartoon land
When all of a sudden I ran into Sponge Bob Square Pants
He was chillin wit the Power Puff Girls and Spiderman
Drivin down Sesame Street wit Scooby Doo in a mini van
He was rockin to the beat drivin as fast as he can
They almost ran over Ren and Stimpy and HeMan
I yelled at them SLOW DOWN!, but they didn't understand
They said they were headin over to a free hip hop jam
Over in the park, let me catch a ride then
I got in, picked up Bart Simpson and kept drivin
Got to the spot and the part was live and
At the open mic contest Beavis and Butthead were rhymin
I was like, them kids is wack give me jus a try and
Waited patiently til it was just my time and
I told the crowd to make noise get ya hands high and
This is what I said when I grabbed on the mic, I told em..

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
I told the crowd my name is KJ-52
And I came to get down I got something to say to you
Understand what I mean even if you're a cartoon
Jesus reigns supreme that's how my teams comes through
And then all of a sudden these wannabe hard dudes
From South Park walked up just talkin smack too
And the Smurfs backed em up I guess they was just a crew
And said lets battle fool, I said check it out dude
Your five inches tall plus ya'll crew is blue
I'd probably step on all of y'all if I jus battled you
They said La la la la la
that's all you ever say dude
Jus right then, the crowd jus started to boo
Them right of the stage, but I knew jus what to do
I told DJ Voltron, jus on the ones and twos
Man kick the beat check it out this is how I'm rockin you

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
Well the crowd started cheerin the party was slammin
The Thundercats and Pokemon they was breakin dancin
The Transformers hopped in and they were pop lockin
Wit G.I. Joe and Johnny Bravo chillin and jus watchin
I jus stayed on the mic, and kept the speakers knockin
Lettin them know that Christ was the reason that I'm droppin
All these words of life and He's the reason Why I'm rockin
I could go on all night and jus kept talkin
But just right then the Power Rangers started walkin
Up on the stage and said I won the open the mic and
As I reached to get my trophy and jus claim my prize and
Well out of nowhere well this is what happened

Nobody except God should ever tell you how to act

Stop runnin around always missionary datin
You think that the one you're lovin you gonna be savin
But end up wit problems from the choice that ya makin
Now some y'all girls y'all need to start carin
And think twice about the clothes that you're wearin
I know it might be nice to have all the guy starin
But take advice, respect yourself as a women
We all want love and we all want attention
But that ain't the way to get it you understand what I'm sayin
Wit the baby gap outfit on that ya wearin
Sneakin out the house tryin to hide from ya parents

Stop fightin, that's what I scream from my bedroom
it seems like lately this is all they ever do
Sayin things to each other like shut up and I hate you
Now every word cuts me deep like knives that stab you
I bury my head under the covers cause I have to
Drown out jus hearin my mother now tellin my dad to
Get out the house, I wonder when I'll get the bad news
I hate it when they scream loud plus when they shout too
I can't stand it when I see, and I really hate the sound too
As these tears run down my eyes until I can't do
Nothin but hope and pray and to try to understand to
I guess I'm gonna have to wait do whatever I can do
I lie in bed and shake cause this ain't what I planned to
Go through, plus I'm only six years old too
And I miss you so much and I jus want to hold you
But on the day you walked out, this is what I told you

[Chorus]
Oh I miss you so much, Mommy please don't go

Well you're gone but I see you on the weekends
But you and Dad right now really ain't speakin
And when he drops me off, I can jus feel the tension
Between you and him, but it something I didn't mention
Sometimes I close my eyes and jus start pretendin
That you're back together and I start to imagine
You both pick me up, and you hold me tight and I'm laughin
But when I opened them up I realized it never happened
And deep down inside my own mind I jus feels so sad and
Most of the time in the night I jus wake up cryin
Something ain't right cause now at school I'm fightin
I wish I was someone else and livin some other life and
I'll never forget the day I think I was just nine when
Ya told me the news that you two was divorcin
And I'ma live wit you now cause its the courts orders and
I said this to my dad jus wit tears in my eyes that

It all changed that year in that one summer
A new family, a stepfather, and a little brother
New neighborhood, new school and a new mother
But how I'm a gonna make it through, now I got to wonder
But out of nowhere you appeared right there
Placed your hands on my face and jus brushed away the tears
Watched it all fade away you just chased away my fears
Showed me for always for all days that your're always here
You told me no matter what my love will never disappear
And there's more then enough you
Demonstrated that you cared
Ya shed the blood of your son, you didn't ever spare
Gave Him up for me, even though it wasn't fair
Ya hung up on a tree where everybody could stare
He died so violently naked and jus bloody there
It was all jus for me nothing even could jus compare
I think back in the day that I used to jus declare that..

KJ-52,"INTRO:
All rise. Case number seven-seven-seven-five-two.
Defendant KJ-52 verses the Son of God in murder one.
How do you plead?
Guilty as charged.
Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Then go ahead.

VERSE 1:
I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth now, so help me God.
What I testify and what I'm speaking of is an eye witness account of an experience of a kindof love,
I confess now to what it was.
I was guilty of making the very Son of God now shed His blood, and
I was guilty of the reason now why He was hung, and
I'm guilty for every evil thing not that I have done.
I'm guilty for it all, I can't blame no one.
I'm filthy with what caused the death of the Son.
It kills me to think I was the one who shed His blood.
I still think of the way He died now and how it was.
It feels me with pain inside, I feel like throwing up.
I can't escape, I can't lie, I didn't make it up.
I was the one who took the life of the Holy One.
This is the first time I've confessed now to what I've done.

CHORUS 1:
I'm guilty, guilty.
That's right, I'm guilty.
God forgive me, I'm guilty.
You know what? I'm guilty!

VERSE 2:
Yeah that's right, I did it.
Right out in the open for all to see it, and
I never hid it, I got to admit it.
They took the whip, ripped His back wide open and split it.
I heard Him cry every time they pulled it back and hit it.
I wondered why He was silent now, I didn't get it.
I watched Him die while He cried out ""It is finished"".
Thought nobody would find out about the the crime I've committed.
I tried to hide out, it's too late, that's right I did this.
It's my time now, my own eyes have been a witness to my crime.
Now I'm speechless and I'm defenseless.
Can anybody find out it's obvious that this is my final time.
Now I've finally come to my senses.
I'm a climb down and take whatever I'm sentenced.
I know why there's no way now that I could miss this.
I opened my eyes, now I see Him just for who He is.
This my guilt is mine now, it's so obvious that...

CHORUS 2:
I'm guilty.
God forgive me, I'm guilty!
I'm guilty.
That's right, I'm guilty.
So help me.

VERSE 3:
I'm just another person, I'm just another man.
I was the one that hurt Him, I finally understand.
Now I know that for certain I caused the nails to land,
That left Him dead and murdered, pierced in feet and hands.
So now you've heard it, I testified and took the stand.
No other way I could word it, this is my confession and,
I never lied or purgured, I told just the best I can but,
I was the one that cursed Him, I was the trigger man.
The page is turning and I've now just confessed to this.
I didn't kill Christ, but it was just my sin that did.
Now I've confessed to the crime, I don't deserve to live, 
I'm ready to do my time. All that I can say is...

CHORUS 3:
I'm guilty.
God forgive me, I'm guilty!
I don't deserve to live, I'm guilty!
Take me away, I'm guilty.
I'm guilty!

OUTRO:
Case number seven-seven-seven-five-two,
KJ-52 verses the Son of God in murder one.
The court has found you guilty as charged.
However, after further review of the case,
The prosecution has dropped the charges.
You're free to go.",I'm Guilty
KJ-52,"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know

They wanna shut me up until I can't speak at all
They won't let me up they wanna see me fall
But it ain't nothing 'cause I done seen it all
Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe at all
I lie awake at night I can't sleep at all
I got no strength to fight I can't shake it off
But that's the time in my life when I hear you call
You say hold tight you say hold on
You say it's alright you say stand strong
'cause my whole life I got a plan and all
So I don't worry about a single thing that happens y'all
Say what you want you can talk on
I'm a get on up and I'm a walk on

Keep ya hip-hop and keep ya lip locked
I ain't gonna listen now to them talk
I ain't switching up and I ain't gonna stop
I ain't giving up and I ain't gonna drop
Even when I just get stuck up in ruff spot
I ain't got much but what I just got
You see it's more than I need when I just drop
To my knees and I can see that he shows up
You can't break me down that's some real talk

You ain't never gonna take me down

Your never gonna take me down

So what you gonna do when it falls apart
Who is the one man that you call upon
When everything that you know keeps going wrong
Plus you feel like you can't keep going on
See I know dukes your barely holding on
They wanna break you down but keep rolling on
They wanna take you down but don't let em y'all
They can't hold you now God's in control
Don't slow it down just walk it off
It ain't easy I know sometimes its really hard
Please believe me I know you see I'm battle scarred
With my knees to the floor that how I battle on
Say what you want you can babble on
This I know what I got so I travel on
Don't ever stop that's why I wrote the song
So ready or not now bring the chorus on

You hold your head up high living it w/out no shame
And every day it gets a little harder just try to pray
If I could sit you down here's what I would say

Your wings are broken yet you keep on flying
Every time I talk to you you never recognize it
Holding on to your past yet you kept denying
Try to mask your hurt in all the junk that your trying
Yet I’ll be lying if I said its all ok

Klaatu,"Back in 1870 just beneath the Great White Way
Alfred Beach worked secretly
Risking all to ride a dream
His wind-machine

New York City and the morning sun
Were awoken by the strangest sound
Reportedly as far as Washington
The tremors shook the earth as Alfie
Blew underground
Blew underground
He blew underground, yeah

Ahh
All aboard sub-rosa subway
Had you wondered who's been digging under Broadway?
It's Alfred
It's Alfred

As for America's first subway
The public scoffed, ""It's far too rude""
One station filled with Victoria's age
From frescoed walls and goldfish fountains....

Klaatu,"The last time I went swimming
I started to drown
And my head it went down
And then the lifeguard he jumped in
Grabbed hold of my hair
And he pulled me to ground
He was a true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild

I wonder what it would be like
To be the ultra maroon
Who was first on the moon
'Cause who could help but dislike
A man it is known
Has the guts of a prune
Wanna be a true life hero
Friend of every man and child
A true life hero
I really do think it'd be wild

I could never be like him
I could never be strong
'Cause I'm always wrong
So I'll just sit here thinking
How nice it would be
If it only was me
Who was a true life hero
Friend of every man and child

Some new equipment to take us where we're going 
A subspace machine, a hole in the fabric

It took man a million years 
To make it only this far 
And we'll leave the solar system very soon...

There's nothing left to stop us now 
We're sure to win the race 

(Sure to win the race...) 

In our warp where time and space are one 
We can no longer see the sun 
In fact there's nothing there for us to see 
For light is nowhere near as fast as we 

Our computer says we've exceeded expectations 
When we reach our departure point there will be celebrations 
What this means is our existence no longer has a limit 
The universe will be our new home 

Now the earth is just beginning to learn of our existence 
All life in space must learn to live as one 
Maybe now is the time for friendship with out neighbors 
For our planet is the second from the sun

Klaatu,"As facts are few and far between hypothesis denies all logic as to what precisely, er, led to her demise. For what appears sheer grandiosity, no legacy remains except her crumbling ruins on which these words were found engraved:

Politzania

Long live Politzania
Politzania
Politzania
God save Politzania

Now these ancient Politzanians as far as archeologists have traced had most thoroughly convinced themselves they were a superior race. Quite a ridiculous notion, granted, however if we assume her sister rivals rose to quell such monstrous claims, I most humbly submit her unpleasant end is satisfactorily explained.

Now you find it harder still
You seem quite catatonic of late
Say your last rites for the world that created you madman

Time passed and you ceased your evolution
Where is your solution now
It's over
You missed your last chance to find the answer
Before the last man becomes a madman

Klaatu,"""I am the very loneliest of all creatures in the universe
Indeed I am an epitaph to man
For having witnessed mass destruction like you've never dreamed and worse
I fear I shall bear witness once again.""

So said the lighthouse keeper
As he struggled up the spiral stairs
Which led him to the laser flare which spanned the cosmic void
Where keeping constant vigil
He'd forewarn this gallant guard of guards
Beware all ships the space graveyard and its stones of asteroids

""For though my race was thought immune
Themselves they did consume
So be warned or be mourned tomorrow
And from your deafness do desist
And pray take heed of this
For your present course can only end in sorrow...""

So said the lighthouse keeper
As he wiped a teardrop from his nose
Upon which his spectacles rose and gazed out to the stars
And like a portrait still he stared
And sighing to himself declared
""I must invent the perfect prayer
Not yours, not mine, but ours

Which in the name of charity
Might lead us to eternal peace
The ultimate philosophy
Some simple, single phrase."" The old and much encumbered man
Then came to rest with head in hand

When people worked overtime overtime 
In fact I think in 1985 
Life was busy in the big city 
And the union was sitting pretty 
It wasn't easy to stay alive 
And they'd run from the city to the sun and the country 
And never quite get away 
When the weekend came 
Everybody took a holiday 
Everybody took a holiday 

On a Sunday in July 
Everybody made up their minds 
And when Monday rolled around no one came home 
All the cities and streets were bare 
Everybody was having fun elsewhere 
As the weeks went by no one came home 

And they'd run from the city to the sun and the country 
And never quite get away 
When the weekend came 
Everybody took a holiday 
Everybody took a holiday 

But the world has changed today 
Everyone works in the usual way 
But at least we had one month away 
Things are much much slower now 
People get away anyhow anyhow 
When the weekend comes they take a holiday 

And they run from the city to the sun and the country 
And never quite get away

Directed to a fool 
Then he'll ignore his own unending speeches

I got through the morning in the usual way 
I caught the bus on time 
Good morning, Mr. Driver, drive 
As I sat inside my overcoat I clutched my cane 
And pressed my nose against the foggy window pane 
Ho hum 
The life I lead would even make a dead man yawn 
Midday comes 
I break for lunch 
With my sandwich and a beer I go on a hunch 
To the park where I hope to find 
A little bit of peace of mind 

As I sat there on a bench amidst the rodent race 
I felt a strange sensation that without a trace appeared 
But then as quickly disappeared again 

So tell me what's the bloody point of playing the game 
With so much to lose yet so little to gain

And while we danced she swayed like a cobra you could almost hear her hiss
As her green eyes hypnotized it was useless to resist
Well she drove me home in her Jaguar and she took me to her room
Though it all seems like a dream it was there I met my doom

Klaatu,"They used to tell me that I was just a fool
Dreaming away my time
But they soon found the more they put me down
The more I blocked them from my mind
I used to get my teacher so uptight
He'd always have to ask his questions twice

I'd be a million miles away
Drifting through time and space
I was a million miles away from any place
I was a million miles away
In a world of my own
A million miles away to parts unknown
I'd be gone

My end-of-term reports would always show
I did pretty well at school
But I kept them hid from all the other kids
I didn't want to seem uncool
My homeroom teacher didn't understand
The reason why I never raised my hand

I was a million miles away
In a world of my own
A million miles away in parts unknown
I'd be gone

I've flown across the galaxies
And been to Berkeley Square
I've passed the time with Sophocles
But never left my chair

But I'm a million miles away
Drifting through time and space
A million miles away from any place
A million miles away
I've built a world all my own
A million miles away to parts unknown
I'd be gone

I never had such good times as the ones we used to have together 
You're the one I told my problems to 
Throughout the years remained true blue 
No I never had a closer friend than you

No use trying to pretend it isn't so

Klaatu,"Back in 1870
Just beneath the Great White Way
Alfred Beach worked secretly
Risking all to ride a dream
His wind machine
His wind machine
New York City and the morning sun
Were awoken by the strangest sound
Reportedly as far as Washington
The tremors shook the earth
As Alfie blew underground
Blew underground, he blew underground

Ah, all aboard Sub Rosa Subway
Had you wondered
Who's been digging under Broadway
It's Alfred
Poor Al, oh no, Al
As for America's first subway
The public scoffed
""It's far too crude""
One station filled with Victoria's Age
From frescoed walls
And goldfish fountains
To Brahmsian tunes",Sub Rosa Subway

You're the theme of my every whim 
You're the highlight of my invention 
Tell me whether I sink or swim 
Cherie be my cherie 
Marry me my Cherie 

In the twilight come to my right 
Chase the dark away when it comes 
Cherie won't you stand to my right 
Have our memories just begun 

Cherie be my cherie 
Marry me my Cherie 

Everything's ours if we want it together 
Everything's here if we want it to be

Klaatu,"See the rainbow by that grove of trees 
Has it not appeared quite suddenly 
Look there, up in the sky 
Can you still pretend to deny 
It's a little bit strange 
How the stars rearrange 
Every time we wander here 
It's always the same 
Now isn't it strange? 
A lilting song floats upon the air 
Whenever the wind whispers through your hair 
And with one great big beautiful smile 
You bring out the sun for awhile 
Wouldn't you consider it odd 
When the whole world starts to throb 
Every time I hold you here 
Near to my heart 

Now isn't that odd? 

Around and around and around ring-a-rose 
Let's make believe it's a merry-go-round 
We go like so 
I'm as dizzy as a top, I'm a-tumbling down 
And what's more fun than a fumbling clown 
Dancing through the green grass 
With your hands in the air 
Touching the sky up there 

Ooh why does 
Everything you touch feel so fresh and new 
How is it spring seems to follow you? 
'Cause where your feet have touched the ground 
The meadows with flowers abound 
Nothing could be quite so wild 
As skipping through them like a child 
Every time I'm here with you 
Every time I'm here with you 
Every time you bring me to Tokeymor Field

Klaus Badelt,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine

Klaus Doldinger,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Klaus Doldinger,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch

Klaus Doldinger,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You don't realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes.""",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes
Klaus Flouride,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air.

Klaus Weiss,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

With a silver arrow lying at its side

Oceans of tears,

And death without reason

Valleys of love,

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you

That brings this sensation, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

And now I get it
Hey Look!
There's a lot of history here let me tell you
I hope you're sitting down, baby,
Sorry, it took so long
But you were far away,
And I just found your phone number today
So I'll spit it out now baby

Are you feeling me?
I don't believe your stories
You're no more brave than you used to be
Take me seriously
I'll pretend that I'm not he
But it's still hurts and I still breathe
But while I'm quick to admit that the outlook's bleak
I'm pulling in five hundred bucks a week
I'm fine with the way things are
And I'm in love

There's nothing I would rather do
Than anything involving you
You're still the one I can't stop thinking of

Got lost on the Penna Turnpike

How soon we forget how much it hurt the first time
And I smiled at the stroke of midnight
Cause I knew the trap I'm in is skin tight
Somehow I know we'll get by

Because I'm much smarter now
I know all your secrets and even they don't get me down
Your hard to figure out and even harder to please
But that's what I need
I know it's hard to believe but just trust me

I know how it feels to be seventeen
To be young and in love
And feel so unclean
To just lie in your bed and you pray that your eyes won't close
Cause heaven only knows how much I dream about you
I know what I'd be without you
And the saddest image I have seen
You run right through my scar queer ass
And shatter my heart of glass
And how hard I'll laugh
As I cash in the insurance policy
You say it's obvious
Then prefer honesty
Well, I'm in no mood to defend my immodesty
So let's just pretend that I've ended my odyssey

Where else can I go?
You're the sweetest girl I know
I'm pregnant
And I'm coming home to you

Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing
KLIMT 1918,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

When it all comes true, man
Wow! That's somethin' else

Look-ah here
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am ah-knockin' on her door

My Gianni Versace blue leather suit
My nails were done and my hair was fierce
And I was riding in a Cooper's limousine, don't you want to ride?

I was at home feelin' sleazy
So I went down to the speak easy
As soon as my feet hit the door
I had all attention from the dance floor

Don't you know the men all pause?
When I walked into the room the men all pause
The men all pause when I walked into the room
The men all pause and the brides held their grooms

And they all sang the same old tune

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Starin' faces startin' to get tired
I wanted to get out and go for a ride
Maybe this boredom created my hunger
So I said, ""Pull over at the local fat burger""

I tried to walk in shy, very unnoticed
But the men turned away from their burgers and sodas
The focus was on me, I guess admirin' good taste
I tried to play it off but assurance was all over my face

The men all pause
When I walked into the room
The men all pause the men all pause
And the brides held their grooms the men all pause

And they all sang the same old tune

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa check me out

I had my claim on any man

Slap me, no, somebody slap me

I'm givin' attitude all over the room

And I just look too good for these people

Check it out
First of all I would like to dedicate this song
To a very special and beautiful young lady
A lady whom in which I am in very love with
So from the bottom of my heart I speak
Only what I feel hoping that you will
Understand that there will never be another man
That'll love you the way that I do
You are my world and without life is not worth living
So please baby give me one more chance and I
The man that loves you will never let you down

[Knightowl]
Since nobody's weak like you
Baby though you know that I love you
You be the girl that I'm thinking about
Every muthafuckin day
I can't get you out of my mind
I remember the day that I met you
The day that I saw you the very first time
I knew that I had to make you mine
So I started to walk where you was at
I asked for your name
You gave me your name and number
Now you're stuck inside my brain
Cause all that I think about
Is how much I want to be your man
And spend my life with you my girl
Because I love you
We talk on the phone at night on a regular basis
But sill I haven't popped the question
Baby will you be my girl
I know that I'm the one for you
And you're the one for me just take my hand
I'll be your man together us two for eternity

[Chorus]
I want to love you until the end of time
I want to make you mine baby don't go
You are the only one I think about everyday
I want to make you mine baby don't go
Say that you'll be my girl (say that you'll be my girl)
Say that you'll be my girl.

[Knightowl]
Nobodys ever been able to make me feel
The way you make me feel
This love is real I'll never put nobody else above you
Never did I think that a man like me
Would have a chance
But now that it's me and you I'm trapped
Inside of this romance
My world was lonely until the day
That you came along but now I am living life
With you, you are what keeps me strong
Without you life wouldn't be worth living
So don't leave my side
I hope someday you'll be able to say
That yes you'll be my bride
I've been in love with you for quite some time
And I feel so good that I got a woman like you
To love me when I need you hug me kiss me
Don't you stop
And tell me that I'm the one that you need
You are my world
So tell me baby that you want to be my girl

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
I know that I've done things in the past
but how long will this last
I said that I was sorry
please forgive me just give me one more chance
My life without you ain't the same
I'm learning from my mistakes
And though these heart aches
You're putting me through I need you
Baby don't go I've always been true
I've never cheated
I've always been that man you wanted
Girl you're what I needed so give me your love
Come back I'm waiting for you the girl of my dreams
Oh how unreal it seems
When you're not here standing next to me
Remember the day you kissed me
The very first time I held you tight
When we made love that night
We both knew what we did was right
Cause we was both in love
And you're the only one I'm thinking about
I have no doubt it's you the one I love
Mireya, would you be my girl?

I wish they all could be California

California bitches
(Tim dog)
Some bad hoes
Bitch you digging in the wrong dirt bitch
Ain't no gold in here
Fucking with the wrong niggas
Knoc-Turn'al, Slip Capone, Short Dog

I knew a tight white bitch named Marianna
She lived right around the corner from Temecula
See I was bored, I fucked both of them whores before
So I called my other bitch Elsinore

She wasn't cracking
So I called up Hesperia and Monrovia and Valencia
I got some pussy from Pomona and her sister Corona
It ain't nothing like them hoes in southern California

I knew a bitch named Irvine
She had a cousin with the name Santa Ana
It was short for Anaheim
I got high in Riverside with Receda and Rosarito
And Santa Clarita and [unverified]

I'm pleased to meet you
I've been all around the world
And with over a thousand girls
And homeboy I don't know what you have been told
But Eskimo pussy is mighty cold
(Brrr)

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

You might be gold
But lately I been doing the platinum pose
Knoc-Turn'al's on 128 girl
What? I'll be right over

Magazines choreograph me in photos
I put out with three dime pieces slamming four doors
And if I can use cities in relation to hoes
I probably fucked San Fernando's daughter, Santa Barbera

And her best friend Alameda and Sierra
And Ramona's little sister Covina
And I don't know what you thought
Whether you turned the cat in the night bitch

Still the only manipulation weapon you got
Knoc-Turn'al ain't the one to fall victim to your plots
Before I save a hoe from the block
Her great grandchildren's corpses will rot
Fuck a hoe

I'd rather have money and a multiple round spitting glock
Four mansions with multiple cars investing my chips in stock
Even if I can't spell dow jones I still pull out fat knocks
It don't stop

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

They say this is a man's world
Can't understand it girl
All you ever wanted was a man like Chante Moore
You know us ballers never have one woman

And when you need us we never come running
That's why now you think about your ex again
You want to page him just to have sex with him
But instead you better call your next of kin

And complain these ballers won't let you in
She don't love you she loves money and sex
Bitches shoot you in the head for a Rolex
I know the bitch is a dick fiend

I fucked her one night when she was sixteen
I know it seems like a long time ago
But I fucked her again when she was twenty four
Bitch, I'm an old school vet, they call me Too $hort

Look your woman in the eyes
What she do it for? Biyatch
You know these hoes man
They'd do anything if they think it's for the money, that's why

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us

damn! And the bitches like -

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
I'm just lookin' to have a good time and find some ass to grab
A nice bush to stab and hit, minus the bullshit, minus the two bit
Up her knowin' I'm ruthless and need of a good bitch
So independent, more than my mistress, more than to fuck
She comes, reopen the guest list
My bunny rabbit, most men want but can't have it
I'ma tap it, and get pornographic, it's automatic
She turns heads, everywhere she goes
Men that's young and old
And bisexuals, would like to go low
And deliver low blows and high off sex and no do's

[Chorus]
I just need me a little good lovin'
Sex she wants but she wasn't my cousin
Sexually, she can be, so misleadin'
Secretly, between the sheets, and she's leadin'

Love slave (love slave)
Pretty skin, high yellow, dressed in all black leather

Up in the place, doin' the thing, amazing grace
Amazingly shakes ass and cakes
Dressed in drape and all lace, breakin' me off
Breakin' it down, breakin' a sweat, touchin' the ground
Up at the lounge, up at the club, and up at the spot
Up in the bathroom, living room, or out on the block
I won't stop, I won't quit, drinkin' a 5th
Bangin' some new shit from Dre & DJ Quik
Shakin' the miss fist & miss hit, call up the smile and fake tits
Hollywood and fakeness, good and greatness
Everything, a difference is, the difference is
In this bitch is, she ridin' dick
Up this place to be, playin' the game
Makin' the dame, ignorin' the fame, ignorin' the things
That make a dream and stressed out, simply plain
I maintain a main gain of material things

[Chorus]

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
Thinkin' bout goin' home, freakin' the ho
Bringin' the drink, bringin' some dank and get on the floor
I'ma, rock it right and separate the men from mice
Live yo' life, fuck the limelight rap hype
Lookin' to have a good time by midnight
And get mines off and chill with a few dykes
Ready and willin', sorority pledgin'
Lessen them and breast be puttin' work in
Her man won't know when she craves what she do
When she ain't up in the club and she up in my room
I seen some guy for less, die for nothin'
Then seen some rest in peace over fuckin'
Stay in the place to be, doin' the same thing
Maintain my good game and things won't change
Niggaz is some timey, salty as one grain

Knoc-Turn'al,"[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Yeah
It's how we do
This a little story about uh..
A nigga you know well, Knoc-Turn'al

[Hook]
I can see you watching
Waitin in my garden
In my bushes plottin
Peepin' Tom's in my home
Lookin in my window

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
There lived a nigga named Knoc-Turn'al
America's most wanted, for sho'
In a black Lo-Lo, with tinted windows
Just cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Checking all my traps and all my hoes
Life is, too short, I stay on my toes
G'd up, I spill gin and juice on brand new clothes
I pulled up, hit a switch and dropped the back
On the prowl in a black hat lookin for cats
I got a chrome plaque that reads, ""Who's the Mac?!""
Black pussy, always talk about it 'cause I love it
This California love got a nigga drunk in public
Express yo' self, keep doin' it good
Got white on the block, keep the heat in the bush
Keep risin' to the top, keep smokin' the kush
The boys in the hood are always hard
Come talkin that trash, we'll pull your guard
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Can't trust my homies, can't trust no bitch
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't say shit
It's hotter on the block than it is in the kitchen
And I'm hard in the paint, listen, I'm steady dippin
I get down, while your bullshittin'
And these are the tales, the freaky tales
Of a nigga on the grind that you know so well
Got a system in your trunk then I'm jacking for beats
Black superman, I put it down for L.A.C
I grip the pump in my lap at all times
Fools be jackin' other fools but they don't be jackin mine
Summer time in the L.B.C. (Fuck the police)
Fuck being bound by law and the peace treaty
We be clubbin, everybody likes when the girls shake somethin
System overload, stay bumpin
It's thug life, y'all know the rules, gotta do what ya gotta do, and stay true
Propose a toast to the West Coast
Easily I approach the microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your mama to get off of my dip
I have no time to give her my dick, I'm gonna hold it
And walk around the stage
And if you fuck up, I'm gonna get my gauge and shrivel you up
Like California raisins, then unload the barrell and laugh
'Cause I'm puttin lead in your motherfuckin' ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm on the radio, and ain't a damn thing funny
It's just like Compton, bitch better have my money
I messed up and I don't know why
Tryin' to get a piece of that American Pie
Do my thing, blow off the roof on 187-Proof
It's gettin funk-ay, it's gettin funk-ay
It's the formula, murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
Dear Mama, Brenda had a baby
Hard times got a nigga goin' crazy
The hood can't take me under, it's a G-thang
We backyard bullyin' in the land where we bang
Gangsta's make the world go 'round
What's my motherfuckin' name?
Knoc-Turn'al, didn't even have to use my AK
Today was a good day",Peepin' Tom
Knoc-Turn'al,"Yes
Knoc-Turn'al
Yup
Let's go..

It's amazing
How outta my life I made short a long story
I came a long way outta bullshit but I asked for no glory
I came a long way from the pavement on the block stackin' dough
And on a long day there would be a raid and business was slow
How many times must I see a victim losing a life?
How many days must I hustle 'fore my hustle get right?
How many days must the children duck when bullets take flight?
How would a gang act when one of they own is dying tonight?

Until the day
I want to be right where you are
want to hold you in my arms
want to be your shining star

Until the day
I want to be right where you are
want to hold you in my arms
want to be your shining star

It's amazing
How hard times, they come and they go
In the ghetto, these ghetto days we go with the flow
I spent my whole life hustlin', grindin' the streets
And when hard times came I regrouped and stood on my feet
When will it be safe for kids to go outside again?
When will the day come for us to love and embrace a friend?
I travel all around the world, working, gettin' it right
Because the world is a ghetto and the ghetto's my life

Until the day
I want to be right where you are
want to hold you in my arms
want to be your shining star

Until the day
I want to be right where you are
want to hold you in my arms
want to be your shining star

It's amazing
How mothers in ghetto's hold they heads high
And when times get too hard they just look to the sky
Pull out some drink 'cause the homie would'a been 30 today
But tragedy struck at 14 and took him away
I want a new life where family's don't have to cry no more
I know kids in the ghetto listen to Knoc-Turn'al
Until the day I get all my people off of the streets
I'm'a be here puttin' it down for L.A.C

Until the day
I want to be right where you are
want to hold you in my arms
want to be your shining star

Until the day
I want to be right where you are
want to hold you in my arms
want to be your shining star",Until the Day (A Souljah Story)

What's the difference?
Both of you exploit women for cash
Exactly, but a poor pimp would sell his own ass
I never learnt to sip, man I dropped out that class
You better smoke your hemp through an oxygen mask

When she woke up late in the morning
Light and the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
O' what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching sun
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy

You'll never meet a girl like Equeena I bet
But if you ever shall than consider you blessed
She's rich beyond the natural so my spirit's impressed

Had an encounter with this gal at Grammatical show
She was looking unfamiliar but someone I'd like to know
So I thought possibly could she be of the same mind
Taken by her beauty but was anxious to find..
Out. See what this woman was all about
But I doubt I'll get the time of day so I'm out
I thought to myself, you'll never know until you ask her
Well, I tend to dig the chicks that do agree with my pastor
So I inquired 'bout her name she threw it out but I missed it
At first I had the jitters to nervous to even listen
Shook her hand said, ""Hi, I'm Knowda or Verbs is what's preferred.""
She cracked a smile like a baby and I'm glad that part occurred
With that she broke the ice the conversation was nice
Should I ask her for her number? Don't think twice
I tried to stay on my toes and kick the lines that were witty
And avoid saying things like, ""Gee, Equeena you're so pretty!""
Kept my cool and maintained never thought she saw me sweat
But I never will forget the day that we met
She had an ill type of radiance you felt when her presence
With a certain type of glow like lamps that be fluorescent
Her own type of flav that stretched from head to toe
I think when she was made they went and dipped the mold in gold
The way she moved was angelic she my eyes dance
At first I was a skeptic at this love at first glance

Lemme tell you 'bout this girl named Equeena I met
You'll never meet a girl like Equeena I bet
But if you ever shall than consider you blessed
She's rich beyond the natural so my spirit's impressed

A couple of hours have passed we've shared some things an we've laughed
In my book from one to ten she rates eleven and a half
You can tell she opened up as the time flew by
She was no plain Jane looking for the average Joe
Equeena had plans she's not the type to live trife
She wants to graduate from college wants to live a Godly life
She wants to go wherever she feel God leads her
Wants to hook up with a man that honestly feels he needs her
So the fact that we actually crossed paths it all seems odd
She let me know first off she wants a man who seeks God
So I thought BINGO! Can I please be a contestant?
Thanking God for early Christmas an unwrapped present
He must've reached into the heavens took the fixing's and the makens
And made the girl of my dreams that I could see when I'm awakened
The time drew near for us to part for the momento
Got her little backpack took some paper and passed a pencil
Needless to say by that I was deeply flattered
Taking note of her fragrance and the way her eyes have battered
I explained her the blessing just to meet her acquaintance
She gave a hug and I was like a king
It's like I can't just say goodbye somebody call the F.B.I
I've caught a case of the love bug and can't deny
But wonder why? We came so close at an escalated rate
I think she's in the Syllabus, man God is great!

Strong, bold and demanding that makes the girl outstanding
Often imitated and simulated but never is she replicated or emulated

Knowdaverbs,"[Verse 1: Knowdaverbs]
Looking at the world through tortoise shelled Gazelles
Two styles once separate have locked from parallel
'Cause the less without the greater just couldn't suffice
so with cans, tiles, and mics we serve Christ
I can't conceive why those in disbelief
Stand back in awe that should be sighs of relief
I'm thinking like this it all seems correct
Use the gifts he gave to glorify, never neglect that
Review the word it stays in tact should have known that
From the day they rolled the stone back
Entrusted with ableness of the extraordinary
to challenge your physical and make your spirit double daring
While we Brooklyn Rock and rhyme people take it for granted
We move the gospel global universal across the planet
But since the birth of this you seen the bestest and the worstestes
Some claim original but they just pros at being perpetrist
Biters! Counterfeiting God's designs
like there were 1200 Techniques then 2000 by Gemini
He aims to fade the cross and try to scratch the win
Be continuous in your mix then transform you back to sin
But it ain't with it Christ is more than just a figment
Apply God tips live it vivid, like Krylon pigment
Idle minds try to pervert it, kill it, and dement it
The Factors remain to rhyme Christ centered and oriented
Though waves get rough trying to follow the example
The power to tread and trample clear the battle like a sample
Yes! Yes! y'all it don't stop
Christ reigns supreme he be the best sure shot!

[Chorus: Knowdaverbs]
Take a break from rhyming and record and playin'
The real master piece is in the inners activation
Some have doubt about the true Fifth Element
The same yesterday as today and that settles it!

[Verse 2: Knowdaverbs]
I remember the days I was a Hip Hop tot
Shuffled on box tops dubbed tapes from cousin Scott
Then it seemed different once Christ was implemented
with the Fifth Element in it the skills are fermented
There's no rule breakin' that's the art of emceeing
Masters commissioners professin' his living being
Contact the cross recognized the blood lost
and talents you've received all expense no cost
Emmanuel! The greatest emcee the world has ever known
Every time that he bust thousands came to the show!
Emmanuel! The greatest be	-Boy the Earth has ever seen
When it was time for him to break he wiped the slate clean!
Freshly white, brite, glimmerin' like neon
Buffed over what stood before like legal walls to peace on
So like Phanatik says, don't wrap the mystery revealed
Why we sport Adidas? By his stripes we were healed!
Without the rhythm of the word verse ain't complete
While my KJV vibrateth the concrete!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Knowdaverbs]
Take some time read between the sinewaves
excel in excellence plus divine is what the rhymes states
Eight tracks, CD's, back around the vin plates
Form, pause the track... see how your mind waits
We confronted people that doubted what we do
I migrate with Factors a herd of a chosen few
The reason I state that is many receive callin'
But some wade in the water while few are down for all in
Total submission submerged in a pursuit
in a trek for holiness 'stead of cars ladies and loot
Down like a bubble jackets for refining test again
Keep the walk tight left then right like a pedestrian
Many times I've read the word, many times I've been astounded
Integrity and diligence make an emcee well rounded
'Cause what is a deejay if he can't scratch?
What is a emcee if he can't rap?
What's a disciple if his walks wack?
El Shaddai renews it all baby just like that!

In a darker realm I slept for days I wept
For my Lord to open my gates and my soul he kept
'Cause I was null and void in the pathway of righteous

That what God wanted to do that an enemy despised
And as long as he could keep me from a true experience and never ready
He could either steal, kill, or behead me
Tried to hit me with his best shot but not
Somehow avoided being stopped so begun like a Gloc

I-I had to double check, minimize me so he could max-
Imize the plan, like a lamp take a stand
As I study God's hand as it combs through the sand
And recognize his voice when he speaks in the wilderness
Trekking through the dunes not to deviate off the Syllabus
With my ears open widely slow to speak swift to listen
Had to rid me of myself and not to messy up the mission

To disintegrate the trash that wasn't in its purest form

I was on my laptop checking on flights to Cancun Chatting over the net like Agassi and Chang do
Then a message on screen from the Action Headquarters
From the office of the Chief upstairs relaying me some orders
I printed out the agenda and instructed process 
It read: Your mission should you choose to accomplish... 
Another job during vacation I'm not hype on going It's halfway around the world and chances are that it's snowing
Can't concentrate...decisions unwise...if I could stay here and think and just re-energize
I'm very hesitant trying to resist compliance And recalled I'm required off duty and on assignment
An op from the Chief who insist to aid folks I need to get to going before my Action title's revoked
Off to lost cities who drown in no hope Feeling the choke but we go to sever the rope
Action! Getting Ready for some Action Figure. Put the Word into motion, not only hear that we do that!
With my leather bond in hand and game plan on DVD 
Under the assumed identity of a black emcee 
No disguise needed 'cause that can cause less stress 

'Cause action Figures dressed up as bats get a whole lot of press
Met my contact at customs, ""How do I know its you?"" 
Of course the secret password, ""Schlavaboghoul"" 
The backdrop was set as night hit the foreign nation 
Ready for the intake of sensitive information
If the barrier was language we'll break the code of silence
And amputate what may trigger off their motive for violence
Alluded the bad guys in black hats and cheated danger
'Cause the weaponry I use is holding truth in the chamber
Since I received word in the form of the prophetic
That's my safety latch 'til it's matured cause God said it
The Word is like a bullet that must penetrate the heart
Just to end the present life to let the new one start

Knowdaverbs,"I drive not on my own understanding getting
Getting gassed up for advancing
I deflate myself for expanding
Vehicles, we won, be we ride, full on empty

A lot of times I feel not y'all, the mood to write a song
'Cause everything I've kicked around in my head
It feels wrong
I grab a chair, a quiet spot a pen
And empty beat and play it in dire straights
To inscribe this loose leaf

I flip back in my notes to parts I've wrote but never finished
And sew those together in desperate need
For compositions and for known reasons

They never feel too tasty
My word usage is all off and my rhyme pattern is all janky
What ever merry idea started with then I'll divorce it
Then a light bulb pops on, is it God or Verbs trying to force it?

I wanna tune into a song and know it's God without a doubt
And keep my tank full on Christ when my self is emptied out
My job is not to think a million just to figure out a verse
Even in the Bible Belt you hear pants when souls thirst

If we're more commercial than a break in a UPN sitcom
I'd still be held accountable for every line that you hear my voice on
For a car to run at all it must stay gassed up
For me to write at all I need to take the daily task up

Of doing what I need while staying robed
In what I read ain't no harvest to collect
If no farmers will throw no seed although my soul may still say yes
It's a daily thing to wake and knock the mess out the flesh

I drive not on my own understanding, getting
Getting gassed up for advancing
I deflate myself for expanding
Vehicles, we won, be we ride, full on empty

I plans to ride shot gun with my Lord in one accord
There's transportation in his name like Chevy Chase or Harry Ford
'Cause I'd be plain out of luck baking just on what I know
By mind can draw some blanks like karate champs of TaeBo

I exercise his ways I'm fonda' how things work out
His foolishness has been wiser than our strongest of routes
So I surrender all and use the cross as leverage
Trying to scratch the surface of service being poured out beverage

To change my will it cost my life, period, end of story
Do great things in His name so only He receives the glory
To a pessimist an empty glass is just good
For no use an optimist will leave it there
Prepared for full on juice

Obedience keeps you from tickets in zones of speed traps
So His word close and snug tight like wave caps
His sovereignty is like a baby during terms that you're pregnant
'Cause you learn to wait on Him, then you feel it and expect it

Hearing words that I have never heard

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Kobukuro,"2人ここではじめて会ったのが 2月前の今日だね
キスの仕方さえまだ知らなかった 僕の最初の sweet girl friend
たわいもないささやかな記念日 暦にそっと記してた
「今日何の日だっけ?」ってたずねると 少し戸惑って答えた

「前の彼氏の誕生日だ」と笑って答える 笑顔はがゆい
そんな話は耳をふさぎたくなるんだよ 確かに
君が彼といた3年の 想い出にはまだかなわない
それでもこんなに好きなのに すれ違いの数が多すぎて

心の通わぬ やりとりばかり これ以上くり返すよりも
あなたの心が 答え出すまで このまま2人会わない方が
それが明日でも 5年先でも いつでもここで待ってるから
約束しようよ そして2人 心に赤い糸をしっかり結んで

あの頃つぼみだった花はもう あでやかな色をつけた
秋が過ぎ冬を超え枯れ果てた 今の僕を映している

時間ばかりが無情にも過ぎ 途方に暮れる まぶたの裏に
他の誰かと歩く君の姿が浮かんで
もう2度と会えないような気がしてた
いっそ会わずにいようかとも
はりさける胸押さえながら 信じてきたその答えが今

「会ってくれますか?」とあなたの手紙 いつわりのない言葉たちが
あふれた涙でにじんでゆくよ あの場所へむかえに行くから
泣かないでおくれ 今日は2人の1年目の記念日だから
お祝いしようよ 強く結んだ 糸がほどけずにいた事も

You shootin' with your eyes closed, you ain't Sniper Gang

I'm sittin' back plottin', I'm just sittin' back vibin'
A nigga can't complain, I had to use my time wisely
I'm sleepin' in a dorm, but they ain't send me off to college
I still got money buried from that lick I hit in Raleigh
I'm book smart but the streets gave me all my knowledge
So there ain't nun' for you when you comin' out the projects
So there ain't nun' for you when you comin' out the slum
A mouth full of gold teeth, they think a nigga dumb
I got a headful of dreads, think a nigga illiterate
But I know when I go to talk, a nigga'll reconsider it
I know you niggas just tryna benefit
I ain't fuckin' with you a little bit
I ain't fuckin' with you at all
I ain't fuckin' with you at all
I was sellin' weed in middle school, just meet me in the halls
Right now I'm goin' in, but I was just behind the wall
This jail got me thinkin', I feel like everybody flawed
I got too much to lose, but I'll still go at a nigga jaw
I'm down for the count, I'm never down for the cause
I made a million dollars off of shows and goin' hard

Right now I done got too far to give a motherfucker a feature
I'm the freshest man in high-school, but I'm a motherfuckin' senior
Lil' shawty want to kick it, I told her I don't play FIFA
I jumped up out the Beamer, now I'm slidin' in the Regal
That pussy so tight but I be tryna go deeper
If she can make moolah, she a motherfuckin' keeper
Reminiscin' about my niggas, reminiscin' about my homies
I'm thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I'm thinkin' 'bout my whoadies
I don't fuck with Fooly no more but I still fuck with Cody
Got a booger in my nose, A Boogie on the chorus
A young nigga, I jumped off the porch, run Forrest
I'll lose it about that money, I'll go dumb for it
I'm workin' like a Mexican, fuck around and get deported
I bought my mama a crib, thirty clip in my forty
She said that my baby, I told that bih let's go to Maury

Kodaline,"Tell me, tell me that you want me
And I’ll be yours completely, for better or for worse
I know, we'll have our disagreements
Be fighting for no reason, I wouldn't change it for the world
'Cause I knew, the first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you, let you slip away
And I still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to get you here today

You make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong
That’s how I know that you are the one
That’s why I know you are the one

Life is easy to be scared of
With you I am prepared for what is yet to come
'Cause our two hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces, together making one

You make my heart feel like its summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong
That’s how I know you are the one
That’s why I know you are the one

When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free
And my dreams are reachable
You know I never ever believed in love or believed one day
That you would come along

Free me
You make my heart feel like its summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when its wrong
That’s how I know you are the one
That’s why I know you are the one
That’s why I know you are the one
That’s how I know you are the one",The One

Let's go somewhere and finish
What we started
Cause right from the beginning

You know I felt you rise

Up off the dance floor

Cause I want to know
Just how deep
Does your lovin' go
So tell your boys ""good night""

Koffee Brown,"One two I remember when we first met 
I fell in love with the sex hickeys on my tities
Bite marks on my neck wifey like next 
But now you get vexed and in the last six months
Seems you lost respect you don't call when you hang out
Ball with the range out act all wild in the mall want to bang out
Shit nigga you don't know who I be
Instead of flippin on me get a J.O.B.

Loud talkin pickin my clothes like a orphan 
And when ever I'm out you be stalkin
911 paging you be callin what so important
Use the bathroom then you come back and say you want to talk
With your hands not washed and the seat up
Get a job and get your ass up and make the bed up yeah

What do you do when your man is a bum
can't keep a job for more than a month
Your friends don't like him and his game is dead
You blew it off with him cause he's good in bed
Take your keys and throw them out
Or just get mad and run your mouth
You work all day he's on the couch
Don't that make you want to blackout

[Chorus]
Think I'm about to blackout blackout 
Grabin out wildin out 
Flippin on me I'm flippin on you
Don't want to make me act a fool
Think I'm about to blackout blackout
Grabin out wildin out
don't want to lose my cool
I'm about to blackout on you

Talkin like you got room 
Don't even clean the house
Never seen a broom
Movin my shit don't know where its at
I told you more than once I wasn't havin that
I'm about to blackout got to let it out
Doin crazy things make me want to shout
Blowin up my cell what's that all about
Sayin you was home when I seen you out
I'm havin doubts

Now what do you do when your girls a bird
Pack her shit kick to the curb
Lose your cool catch your case
Sleep wit her friends throw it back in her face
Do ya take her back try again
can't leave home don't trust your friends
Turn your back she'll play you out
Don't that make you want to blackout

[Chorus]

Clothes smellin like perfume or makeup 
Call me somebody else when we make love
You trickin my dough at the strip club
You think its a game but I'm gettin fed up
You talkin in codes on your cell phone 
You do it on the low like I ain't gon know
You movin too fast better slow down
You playin me close gonna make me blackout

Yo pluck an independent woman like beyonce
And I could give a damn what you and your boyz say
No need to kick me out I don't want to stay
Pack the coach bags and be on my way I don't need you 
You need a broad that wake up in the morn clean cook and feed you
And that ain't luck nigga that's what's up
Key up the truck and clear the bank account when I blackout

You said you lived alone

See money ain't the thing, it ain't about the rings
And those artificial things 'cause all it really brings, is a lot of pain.

All up in the club, blowing up the spot, all up in the Marriott What?

Anyone could tell, she took me through some hell
Wouldn't even post bail, having you around, I think I finally found
A lover I can feel, someone to keep it real, so baby let's chill

Koffee Brown,"Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run
Galveston, oh, Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying
In the sun, at Galveston, at Galveston",Mars/Venus (Interlude)
Koffee Brown,"Checking my one shorty
Checking my view
Half past two tell me what we gonna do
You staling me now I wanna blaze it out
I wanna see what its like let me take it down
I wanna dive in your tight thighs, got the right size
Wanna do things till you frame hit the light
Slow flow, no clothes, anything goes
Head to your toes, you know I gotta go

Gotta let me know,
Tell is it four

And we can hit the floor
Take it to the back

On the spot, its hot let me hit it
In the back of the club in my SUV
Anywhere you want ain't nobody gonna see

Don't worry cause I know you're gonna feel me
It all will be over in a minute

First thing in the day on my lunch break
We gotta slip away gotta meet some place
Half on the room, gotta get back soon
Gotta half an hour but u know what to do
Take me, make me scream your name
I can take a lil' pain while you do your thing
Overtime, anytime it really don't matter
Feeling for your hit boy give it to me!

Gotta let me know,

Seated in the barber shop, press playin' with it tapered in
Paper thin mustache trimmed and my weekend begin
Gimme plenty of Remy with a double shot of Henney

And I found my baby out there
I said please come back to me darlin'
What in the world are you doin' here?
Then the little girl raised up her head
Tears was streamin' down from her eyes
And these are the things
That the little girl said

When your love has ceased to be (Lord, have mercy)
There's no other place for me 
If you don't hold me in your arms (Oh child oh child)
I'd rather be here from now on

Without your love I ain't nowhere
Oh I can't eat and I can't sleep (oh child oh child)
Lord I can't even live in peace 
Please take me baby for your slave (Oh)
And save me from that early grave

Without your love I ain't nowhere

And then sorrow struck my heart
Tears began to stream down from my eyes
The only woman that I ever loved in whole my life
Out here in a place in a condition like this
And I began to thinkin' about what my mama told me when I was a little boy
She told me when I couldn't help myself, to get down on my knees and pray
Then I fell down on my knees

If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Alle Fans einfach Wegskippen nicht hinhören man
Okay uh

Du hast mich damals unter Schmerzen zur Welt gebracht
Mich und meine Schwester ernährt und das Geld war knapp
Allein mit uns zwei ohne Papa
Und egal was er anstellte, du warst immer auf der Seite von deinem Sohn, Mama
Und ich glaub hätt' ich das als Vater gesehen
Wie mein Sohn für die Schule seit Jahren schon überhaupt nichts mehr macht
Und hätt ich ihn dann auch noch mit Ladungen an Rauschgift ertappt
Dann hätt ich ihm lange schon den gnadenlosen Rausschmiss verpasst
Aber du nicht und es tut mir wahnsinnig Leid
Dass dich wegen mir seit Jahren stets gleich die Panik ergreift
Wenn du beim Kochen aus dem Küchenfensterscheibenglas schaust
Und Polizeiwagen da draußen, vorbeifahren am Haus
Es schmerzt wie Stiche mit nem Messer, das alles nie wieder gutmachen zu können
Doch ich werd immer da sein für dich und meine Schwester
Und ich wünsch' mir im Leben nur dich glücklich zu sehn
Und dass ich irgendwann mal in der Lage bin, dir was zurückzugeben
meine Mama
Uh yeah

Und die Zeiten waren schwierig
Meistens nur Krisen, doch egal, uns kann keiner besiegen
Wenn euch je einer schaden will, werd' ich ihn eiskalt erschießen
Denn ihr seid alles was ich hab, meine kleine Familie

Und ich acker wie eine Maschine
Denn ich will einfach nur irgendwann mal euch Dreien was bieten
Ich bin am Ende, sollt' ich jemals von euch einen verlieren
Denn ihr seid alles was ich hab, meine kleine Familie

Und ich weiß noch, als du uns damals das erste Mal besuchen kamst
Im Sommer vor zehn Jahren, als wir fast ärmer waren als du es warst
In 'nem Loch lebten, das mehr Baracke war als Wohnung
Statt 'nem Sofa und Betten bloß 3 Matratzen auf dem Boden
Du warst Mamas neuer Freund mit etwas dunkler Hautfarbe
Weshalb die Verwandtschaft meiner Schwester und mir laufend sagte
„Passt auf vor dem Algerier da""
Und erst waren wir zwar harte Feinde, aber du wurdest mehr als ein Vater
Und deiner Heimat fern, bekamst du bald Ärger mit der Staatsgewalt
Wurdest dann eingesperrt in eine Strafanstalt
Wo Wärter dich schon schlagen, falls du kein Schweinefleisch isst
Aber mein Stiefvater ist ein Mann, den so schnell keiner klein kriegt
Und es ist heut' im Grunde wie damals, das Geld ist übelst knapp
Doch du bist selbstgenügsam, hustelst hart und hälst dich über Wasser
So wie Eisschollen in Polarmeeren
Und du hast Recht, ich muss weiß Gott mehr Moral lernen
Deshalb hör' ich im iPod stets Koranverse
Eure Ehe waren paar ziemlich harte Jahre
Doch ich bete, dass ihr euch im Paradies wieder vertragt
Du redest kein perfektes Deutsch
Aber wir würden uns auch taub und stumm verstehen
Du bleibst für alle Ewigkeit mein bester Freund, Sidali

Und die Zeiten waren schwierig
Meistens nur Krisen, doch egal, uns kann keiner besiegen
Wenn euch je einer schaden will, werd' ich ihn eiskalt erschießen

Denn er ist der Einzelkämpfer
Und er weiß nicht was kommt, und was das Leben ihm noch bringt
Doch er weiß er kämpft bis Gott seine Seele zu sich nimmt

Doch er bleibt stehen und ist der der die Faust ballt wie Fighter
Und auch falls nicht einer an ihn glaubt macht er weiter
Auch wenn tausend Neider ihn klein kriegen wollen
Ihm sein Erfolg nicht gönnen, ihn bloß scheitern sehen wollen
Er verteidigt sein Stolz, mit aller Kraft bis zum Ende
Keiner schafft's ihn zu bremsen, weil er gemacht ist zum Kämpfen

""Dieser Neid und die Morddrohung, wozu brauch ich diesen Stress?""
Man kann eh kaum verdienen mit Rap
Ich geb dem Volk nur eben diesen Klassiker mit auf den Weg
Und dann bin ich auch schon wieder weg

Als es nur Schlägerein jeden Tag gab zu Haus und er verklagt wurde auf
Riesige Geldsummen, wegen gefälschter Markenkleidung

Denn er ist der Einzelkämpfer
Gibt bei Stress niemals auf, ballt fest seine Faust
Sein Schicksal ist vorbestimmt und er macht das Beste daraus

Und auch in den härtesten Zeiten, kennt er keine Verzweiflung
Denn er ist der Einzelkämpfer
Und er weiß nicht was kommt, und was das Leben ihm noch bringt
Doch er weiß er kämpft bis Gott seine Seele zu sich nimmt",Der Einzelkaempfer
Kollegah,"Hier kommen deineltan Hals über Kopf
Heltah Skeltah und spitz die Lauscher Kumpel
Boss, Boss, BozBlind
Schallt aus deinen Boxen direkt aus dem Hauptstadtdschungel
Blutbad Berlin stürmt an die Front
Jeder Affe wird ausgefummelt
Und wir hinterlassen Trümmer im Rapgame
Fickern geht die Puste aus wie Raucherlungen
Wir heben ab geben Gas
Und deine ganze Crew chillt in der Urne
Deineltan auf der Überholspur
Und alle Ficker haben Bremsstreifen in der Hose
Mach keine Faxen mit uns
Oder geh im Blut baden du Hund
Ich lass' es nach einem natürlichen Unfall aussehn'
Wie Missgeburten

Von Nord dann nach Süd und von Ost dann nach West
Kommt der Sound den du brauchst aus der Hauptstadt, du keck
Blutbad Berlin
Deineltan aus dem Wedding drängen dich Punkarsch aus dem Geschäft
Mit der Faust auf der Fresse stoppe ich dein Kauderwelsch-Rap
Du Hund kannst Niki-Lauda-Style im Auto verbrennen
Ein trauriges Ende du Hund
J.o.D kommt, J.o.D geht seinen weg straight
überleg wo du stehst
Wenn ein Mob aus dem Berliner Norden
Kommt ohne Gnade alles niederräumt
Und jedem der im Weg ist, seinen Kopf abschlägt
Opfer, Neider sehen´s nich ein
Sie kommen zu kurz Rappen is' Neid
Wenn die Untergrundkings mit dem Waffenlogo-Shirt
Und mit der Sonnenbrille auf die Szene zeigen

Ey sieh Bitch, die Gangster kommen zwielichtig wie Dämmerungen
Fahren wir wie Kiezlegenden im tiefgelegten Benz herum und lenken herum
Rollen dann über deine weedkiffenden Hängerkumpels
übrig bleiben zermatschte Körper in widerlichen Pennerlumpen
Ey ich häng dich Bitch an die Wand ran wie’n Wandschrank
Doubletimeflow wie ne Pumpgun
Ey der Typ der den Bizeps anspannt wie Van Damme
Kollegah der Boss kommt mit Deineltan also alle mal jetzt Ruhe
Denn das ist unsere Ära eine glorreiche Zeit wie Hallenbadbesuche
Ey ich komm in deine Town du gehst deine Bodyguards holen aber das sind nur Fliegenfänger
Glaub mir bitte Mutterficker diese Penner
Sind gerade mal 20Kilo-stämmer
Also Penner renn davon, denn wir kommen in deinen Ort und zerbomben deine Stadt sowie Al-Qaida
Sieh mal deine ganzen Leute wollen Autogramme und kommen dann mit Hundeblick an so wie Dalmatiner
Du siehst mich mit Serben ich lass' Kiezstricher sterben
Werde vom Volk zitiert wie die Biblischen Verse
Es ist der allen überlegene Mac der im Rotlicht Koks tickt

Ein Schuss und du bist totschick

Scheiß auf Kompromiss meine Gruppierung ist radikaler als Bin-Laden
Monate später sieht man auf einem gefundenen Tape die Stellungsnahme
Kontrovers diskutiert
Für eingefleischte Fans der helle Wahnsinn
Ich bin bereit bis zum Ende zu rennen
Für den üblichen Fan den Rahmen zu sprengen
Deine Toleranz passte nich' ins Konzept
Wirst du aus der Bahn gedrängt
Punchen hart wie ne Faust aus Stein
Nenn uns d l t wenn wir detonieren wie TNT
Siehst du aus der ferne Rauch aufsteigen

Jetzt kommen die Typen die deinen Ort zerballern
Mit einem Wort hat der Typ einen Mord begangen
Er hat Hörner auf dem Kopf und nen Vorschlaghammer in seiner Faust
Deshalb nennt man ihn Vorschlagtamas
Du bist ein wortkarger Bastard mit viel dahinter wie taubstumme Schwuchteln
Und fortan will Tama$ wieder töten weil sie zu Haufen geduckt gehen
Als gebe es einen Ententanz denn sie wissen in Wedding wird scharf geschossen
Deineltan kommen mit Ellenbogen raus gegen Pimkieträger und ihre Artgenossen
Wenn sie zu Pimkie gehen den ganzen Laden kaufen
Werd ich anlegen und zielen
Nicht nur die Kasse auch den Atem rauben

Kollegah,"Ey ey

Ey es ist Kollegah, Lichtgestalt wie Malaika
Und Du bist lediglich ein Großmaul wie ein Pelikan
Ich trage Kleider von ganz großen Stardesignern
Bin kein Astronaut, aber mein Anzug ist maßgeschneidert
Wenn ich dreist durch die Hood stolzier'
Du schreist kurz und guckst schockiert drein
Und ergreifst nun die Flucht vor mir
Rennst panisch weg um die nächste Straßenecke
Und zwar in 'nem Affenzahn, wie Bananenreste
Ich trag Armaniweste, aufwändig bestickt
Bin in Faustkämpfe verwickelt wie ausländische Kids
Während Opfer sich verneigen
Denn ich durchschreite den Block auf bossartige Weise
Wie osmanische Kaiser
Ey ich brauch' langsam mal 'ne Villa plus Pool
Silberne Uhren, Kid ey, ich bin zwar gebildet und klug
Besuche Kunstgalerien
Aber mit mir ist trotz dessen nicht gut Kirschen essen wie mit Obstallergien

Ey das ist Alphagenetik und Du siehst die Knarre am Halfter
Ich steh' nämlich auf Knarren, so wie das Walter Emblem, Bitch!
Baller' gelegentlich mit einem Colt in Richtung
Von Streifenpolizisten und Kugeln streifen Polizisten
Und jetzt hör' auf mich anzubeten
Und laufend anzuflehen, Dir ein Autogramm zu geben
Oder der Boss betritt Dein Treppenhaus und boxt Dich in die Fresse
Und Du liegst am Ende des Ganges wie ostindische Städte
Mein Herz gleicht einem Block aus Granit
Der Feind kommt, ich thaibox seinen Kopf auf Granit
Ne halbe Line allerfeinster Stoff aus Paris
Und ich schlender dann elegant über den Bossaura-Beat
Wie Magie, und wie wollt Ihr mich hier aufhalten?
Ihr dürft Euer Maul halten, mir die Tür aufhalten
Denn ich betrete den Deutschrap-Drecksladen und räum' auf
Akzeptable Rapper sind hier wie Stecknadeln im Heuhaufen
Und ich übernehme nun im Alleingang die Rapszene
Keiner kriegt mich jemals klein als wär ich Tschetschene
Bleibe der legendäre unerreichte Punchlinekönig
Angsteinflößend färbt sich nach 'nem Punch gleich schön der Randstein rötlich
Ey das ist Kokainmusik
Höre die CD samstagabends und Du kannst Dir sparen Kokain zu ziehen
Denn die Gehirne schütten das Dopamin zum Beat aus
Sieh Kollegah der Boss schuf einen Klassiker wie Mozartsymphonien, Kid",Intro
Kollegah,"Die Sonne scheint hier nicht
Ein Junge weint hier nicht
Jeden morgen zieren Sorgenfalten mein Gesicht
Es kann nicht sein Wo ist mein Heim
Ich schließe die Augen alles zieht an mir vorbei

Die Sonne scheint hier nicht
Ein Junge weint hier nicht
Jeden morgen zieren Sorgenfalten mein Gesicht
Es kann nicht sein Wo ist mein Heim
Ich schließe die Augen alles zieht an mir vorbei

Ich steh' auf geh' in die Küche, Teller und Vasen sind zerbrochen
Scherben liegen rum, weil sie sich gestern Abend wieder kloppten
Also scheiß auf Frühstück, ich nehme ne Dusche
Wecke meine Schwester, mach mich auf den Weg in die Schule
Sitze da darum, aber aufpassen geht nicht
Ich will ausrasten, seit ein paar Wochen hauen sie sich täglich
Wegen irgendeiner behinderten scheiße
Immer nur streit
Meine Schwester schließt sich ein in ihrem Zimmer und weint
Im Inneren weiß ich, die Ehe ist leider kaum zu retten
Doch will schlichten und erreich nichts außer ein paar blauen Flecken
Deshalb zieh ich’s vor mich nach der Schule in den Straßen rumzutreiben
Komm erst in den späten Abendstunden Heim und tröste meine Schwester
Dieser Junge sah noch nie Harmonie seit der ersten Scheidung als er 6 war
Und er weiß schon wieder reisst´s seine Familie in Teile
Er schließt die Augen und alles zieht an ihm vorbei

Die Sonne scheint hier nicht
Ein Junge weint hier nicht

So ging von Anfang an alles schief auf meinem Weg
Jeden Morgen in der Schule ärger ich kam immer spät
Nachts rumgehangen, Goldketten umgehangen
Blut rein, Blut raus
Alles kommt zurück zu dir
Ich steck die Prügel ein, in vielen Prügeleien
Das härtet ab, und danach schlägst du halt irgendein'
Ich kenn alle Tricks, Tricks um nur zu gewinnen
Lauf auf einem schmalen Grad, weil ich kein guter Junge bin

Wo ich herkomm' ist alles grau
Und die Nachbarn laut
Vom Ehekrach nebenan nachts wacht man auf
Und jeden morgen wisch' ich Mum ihre tränen ab
Paps ist nicht da schläft wo anderes wie jede Nacht
Das Geld ist knapp
Die Welt fuck, fuckt mich ab
Ich wollte nur noch weg, genau so wie mein Dad
Ich war gerade 8, Schläge hab ich viel kassiert
Jeden hab ich mir gemerkt, jeden hab ich registriert
Ich wurde älter und meine Eltern arbeitslos
Mutter hatte keine Hoffnung, Vater gab mir keinen Trost
Ich reiß mich los, das Leben macht mich aggressiv
Ich bin wie ein Tier in einer Ecke das keinen Ausweg sieht
Wie mit 13 als sich Mutter scheiden lies
Und ich aus Frust keine scheiße bleiben ließ
Ich konnt´s nicht glauben, wo ist mein Heim?
Ich schließ die Augen, alles zieht an mir vorbei

Die Sonne scheint hier nicht
Ein Junge weint hier nicht
Jeden morgen zieren Sorgenfalten mein Gesicht

Das ist alles Frust den du in dich rein frisst
Weil die Welt kalt ist und dich vergewaltigt
Weil du keinen Halt kriegst, wenn dich alles kalt lässt
Und die Wut in deinem Bauch stärker ist als alles
Überall ist Dreck hier, überall sehn alle schwarz
Jeder ist sich selbst der nächste, das macht unser Leben hart
Ich konnt´s nicht glauben, wo is' mein Heim?
Ich schließ die Augen und alles zieht an mir vorbei

{Yeah, denn wir sehn' daheim tagtäglich nur Streit
Lassen Frust raus, Druck raus in Straßenschlägereien
Hängen bist abends spät rum, weil
Wir die depressiven Launen durch exzessiven Rauschgift-
Konsum wegzukriegen glauben
Ich lieg' im Bett und schließ' die Augen
Denk' an glückliche Ehen, von andern Eltern, unterdrücke die Tränen
Weil nunmal ein Junge hier nicht weint
Ich starre an die Zimmerdecke, alles zieht an mir vorbei}

Ihr labert von Kriminaltaten, aber tickt auf Minimalbasis
Der meine Initialen tragende, glänzende Siegelring
Sorgt in der Regel beim Betrachter für eine Gänsehaut wie Stephen King
Jetzt kommt der Hustler an, Platz da Punk
Deine Gang läuft wie ein Wasserhahn
Penner besser renn davon, wenn der Rapperboss kommt
Meine Kette zeigt dem Betrachter an
Ey, ich bin ein gemachter Mann wie Adam
Und schmucktechnisch der Allerbeste
Sieh der Rest ist wie das Z
Buchstäblich das Allerletzte
Früher war ich der Typ, der nachts zerstückelte Platten in Füchsen abpackt
War lange Zeit stets mit einem Bein im Bau wie ein verkrüppelter Dachs
Wurde leider Gottes irgendwann dann von den Bullen erwischt und danach vor Gericht geladen
Und hatte dann nicht mehr nur 'ne goldene Kette am Hals sondern auch ein Gerichtsverfahren
Yeah doch egal ich bin back, du siehst mich im Club mit mehreren Ketten
Ich hab' in der Hood währenddessen, krumme Dinger laufen wie verschnupfte Märchenhexen
Und deine Frau kehrt heute nicht Heim wie das Rotkäppchen
Weil meine große Kette am Scheinen ist wie Koksreste

Motherfucker, guck auf die goldene Kette
Sie ist stets frisch geputzt und sauber
Sieh ich betrete den Club und tauch' 
Damit Perlen auf wie ein Muscheltaucher
Guck, wie ich die Rapper schlage, guck was ich für 'ne Kette trage
Deshalb jetzt mal ein Hoch auf mich als wär' ich eine Wetterkarte
Ich habe schon damals als kleiner Racker
Den meisten Teil meiner Zeit verbracht 
Mit Scheine machen, aber das meiste davon wurde verspielt so wie kleine Katzen
Ich lenk' den Benz Richtung Selfmade-Studio
Komme, chille, berappe die Beats
Trage Sonnenbrille und scheffel den Kies
Bin von Bonzenviertel bis Ghetto beliebt
Ey, die Hustlerikone vom Selfmade-Label
Deine Leute sagen ich sei abgehoben so wie Geldbeträge
Denn ich führe statt mit Fachidioten nur noch Selbstgespräche
Und sogar die arrogantesten von allen Bitches
Werden in der Nähe vom Überboss zur Groupienutte
Denn Kollegah ist nunmal ein Bild von einem Mann wie ein Van Gogh Selbstporträt
Yeah, und egal ob auf Volksfesten, im Kindergarten oder auf Bolzplätzen
Schon damals in den Kindesjahren konnte man Kollegah nie rumlaufen sehen ohne die Goldkette
Deine Freunde sahen noch keinen Rapper so eine Kette tragen
Und sind deshalb auf einmal so klein mit Hut wie der Sohn eines Mexikaners

Ey der König im Rap, wegen der Größe und Technik, lieben Schlampen diesen Sexgott
Ja auf dem Gebiet bin ich ganz schön bewandert, wie ein Catwalk
Und nun weg da Du Hure, Du nennst Dich einen Vollblutrapper
Ein Stich und Du bist nur noch ein Rapper voll Blut

Während sie spastische Bewegungen macht, wie Justin Timberlake

Dabei mach ich meine Arbeit mal eben so mit links, wie Webdesigner
Jetzt wird gefeiert wie in Apres-Skihütten und ich geb ein' aus

Ich locke eure Mütter zu mir, mit ner Tupperparty

Gebe die Kommandos in deiner Hood und jage die Bullen fort

Blase dir die Lichter aus, komm blasen wenn du Wichse brauchst
Wenn dir dann Wiche in die Augen fließt
Ficke ich dich von hinten und du platzt von innen wie O.D.B
Das ist kein Gruppenkuscheln das hier wird zu Autopsie
Manchmal träume ich das ich auf die Menschen in nem Kaufhaus schieß
Und auch manchmal werden Träume wahr, du bist ein Nuttensohn
Mit deinem Rocawear und deim Zigeunerbart
Jetzt wird tief gefickt, bis dein Kiefer bricht

Gang voller Kalkweißer mit Skateboardern in Halfpipes
Abhängen mit Trainbombern wie al-kaida
Und deine Mutter besucht den muskelbepackten Macho
Mit Putzmittelflaschen in den Schutzkitteltaschen
Und schrubbt mit nem Lappen, sein Badezimmer dann schön sauber
Bis es duftet und die schmutzigen Kacheln, rutschig und nass sind

Oder du zeigst Frauen power bitte nur noch im Umgang mit dem Staubsauger und Wischmop

Falls du weinst, sei dir versichert, ich kehr bald schon wieder heim
Eindrucksvoll wie Meteoriteneinschlag
Ey der selten telefonisch erreichbare Zeremonienmeister
Sah wie das Volk nach diesem Rapklassiker
Verlangte wie Menschen nach Nahrung in Westafrika
Und wenn der absolute Straßenchef back ist
Steht ihr Spastis nur stumm da und lächelt nett wie im Wachsfigurenkabinett
Spast ich mach es kurz
Ich hatte in meinen Hustlerzeiten meistens in den Jackentaschen Haschischplattenspuren
Trotzdem hab ich Abitur
Denn egal was ich mach, ich mach dabei ne fantastische Figur, wie'n plastischer Chirurg
Der Pimp im Mercedes, Ey ich bin ähnlich wie dieser Stephen King
Denn ich drehte Dinger mit E's
Hing in der Regel täglich im Kaffee mit Türken und ließ Straßendeals
über die Bühne gehen als würden sie Theater spielen
Ich durchschreite wie Volkshelden die Hood
Mit goldgelbem Schmuck auf der stolzgeschwellten Brust
Und deine Freunde, die sich abends in den Straßen der Innenstand treffen
Sind am Betteln und hängen an der Nadel wie Pinnwandzettel
Ich fahr im bildschönen Ferrari rum
Du chillst gewöhnlich abends vor deinem Schildkrötenterrarium
Und giltst als armer Junge, der mit dem Euphemismus etwas beleibt
Sein Drecksdasein als Fettsack umschreibt
Ey der Boss streckt reichlich Speed mit Kopfschmerztabletten
Geht es dann an Kids verteilen wie Bibi Blocksberg Kassetten
Während laufend die Frauen diesen pelzetragenden
Aufstrebenden Selfmadestar Honig ums maul schmieren wie in Wellness-Farm
Kaum zu glauben, aber selbst K zum O
Zum Doppel, L wurde damals mal abgezogen wie Robbenfell
Während seiner Anfangstage
Später zog er gerne mal so mancher Dame den Ring ab als wäre sie eine Handgranate
Du sitzt Samstagsabends mit unerfreutem blick rum
Und kriegste Rumgekeuche mit, denn ich bumse heut die Bitch
Die du deine kleine Schwester nennst
Und erzeuge mit meinem ungeheuren dick bei ihr den Jungfernhäutchenriss
Ich hab Groupiehoes und lege fast jede nacht
Dubios im Studio die Ladys flach, wie Julio- Iqlesias
Sehe nachts die Straßenkinder hustlen
In den Nebengassen die von Regen nass sind sowie Badezimmerkacheln
Kid, schluss mit lustig, Pussy renn weg
Oder du kriegst n Schuss in den Head wie bei russisch Roulette
Ich trage ne schussichere Weste unter dem kuschelweichen Pelz
Und sie ist Bulletproof wie diese Schwuchtel bei D12
Guck ich mach mein Geld nicht mehr durch Rauschgifthandel denn
Ich verkauf die Platten endlich 10000-fach an die Fans
Du hast ne feminine Ader wie ein Frauenhandgelenk
Während man die Clowns in deiner jämmerlichen kaum bekannten gang
Allesamt bloß mit Tretern mit Adidaslogo sehen kann
Kommt Kollegah elegant mit Stiefeln aus Alligatorenleder
Geh die Bodyguards holen, ich geh ab wie inner Gladiatorenarena
Und Gegner krabbeln herrum, wie ein Laminatbodenverleger
Ich seh Amilandklone an jeder Raplandschaftsecke
Erschreckende Anzahlen lächerlicher Drecksstandardrapper
Die jetzt langsam checken, dass sie gegen den bosspullovertragenden pimp
In hoffnungsloser Lage sind wie Kosovo Albanien
Und lieber wegrennen, denn der speedvercheckende, knochenharte, kieferbrechende
Boss ist da, viel versprechend wie Stotterer
Sieh, auch wenn du Opfer zwar nicht auf Schornsteinen hockst
Hast du Vorzeigetrottel trotz dessen Storchbeine wie Scott
Ey die in second hand umherrennenden Member deiner Ghettogang
Werden bespuckt wie Method Man - Konzertgänger
Wenn ich back bin werden leuchtende Feuerwerke explodieren
Und deutscher Rap wird dann erneut gänzlich neu definiert

Von mir, Kollegah dem Boss, yeah, das wars

Seele aus Stein, vor dem Labeldeal Speedhändlertätigkeit
Dank Kollegah schmeißen Teenager E-Pillen ein, 
Legen jedes zweite Weekend auf CD-Hüllen Lines
Geh und verneige dein Antlitz nun vor dem weltbesten Doubletimerapper
Der selbst wenn fantastisches Wetter ist Pelz trägt wie Chewbaccadarsteller
Ey ich schreib „Selfmade"" über dein' Rocawearsweater, denn du bist ein Fan von uns
Kennst von uns alle Tracks und rapst sie jedes Mal Wort für Wort mit auf Jams von uns
Ey ich sitz im Benz und wenn du mir um Autogramme bettelnd den Notizblock zuschiebst
Dann macht das leider nur wenig Sinn, denn Kollegah nimmt in der Regel keinerlei Notiz von Groupies
Schon wieder isses Dopetickerbusiness, Rapsound ich streck auf dem Wohnzimmertisch
Komm mit dem Blaue-Augen-Chromsilberblick in den Club
Aufsehnerregend wie ne Mondfinsternis
Stillschweigend stehen deine Leute da, denn ich steig aus dem silbernen Mercedes
Filmreife Szenen, herausragend wie bei Wildschweinen die Zähne
Kollegah ist autoritär, und du wärst gerne auch so wie er
Genau so wie er, auch so ein Player, doch bist Southpolejeansträger
Und spielst leider nur eine untergeordnete Rolle wie in Hauptschulen die Lehrer
Breite Schultern, weißes Pulver, tütchenweise abgepackt, bitch
Der Typ, der keinen motherfuck gibt
Steht für Cadillacs, Ice, Heavyweight, Style
Starker Tobak, da wird sogar Mary J bleich

Der Pokerfaceking hat sich mit diesem Meisterstück persönlich
Selbst feierlich gekrönt als bester größter Rapper
Und sitzt jetzt mit Reichsapfel und Königszepter
Kaiserlich wie Römerchefs da auf seinem Ahornblattthron herum
Von Ratten umgeben wie'n Laboratorium
K zum O, Hardcoreflow, Penner kuck ich geh Punkt 2
In den Club und ab halb 3 wird deine Frau nie wieder an ihrem G-Punkt zweifeln
Dein Portemonnaie voll Scheine gehört jetzt mir und Fav
Und wir machen Fifty Fifty so wie Curtis Jackson Fans auf Curtis Jackson Jams
Ey der Pokerfaceking ist im glänzenden Sportwagen
Mit Gangstern am Vorfahren wie Gefängnistransportwagen
Und lenkt dann den Sportwagen
Routiniert durch die Straßen von deiner Hood und ist von Fans umgeben wie'n
Englischer Vorgarten Kid, ey ihr lasst gerne mal öfters den gangster raushängen
Ey ich lass gerne mal öfters aus geöffnetem Fenster Möchtegerngangster raushängen
Also mach bitte nicht auf Ganove und Halunke, denn du hängst in deiner Wohnung
Ab mit Kumpels und ziehst dir die Prinzen rein so wie das Rapunzel

Du dummer Bengel glaubst ich verticke dir Crackrocks
aber das sind nur Kalksteine, Clown
Ihr bettelt bei dem Mack um Rapfeatures
macht in den Texten und Raps auf Crackdealer, doch seid
Im Endeffekt bloß ein recht biederer kleiner
jämmerlich weinender Messdienerverein
Renn besser davon oder verstecke dich in Katakomben
guck ey deine Freundin ist ne fettleibige Bitch
Die mitten im Dreck des Redlight Districts jeden Tag an der Crackpipe sitzt
Ich habe das Speed, versorg an Bahnhöfen Dealer
Mache Straßenmusik so wie Panflötenspieler, bei mir wurde schon im Kindesalter
Pimpverhalten großgeschrieben und das nicht nur im Rechtschreibtest
Ich komme mit glänzender Armbanduhr und einigen Bangern mit Kahlrasur
Fahre den Mercedes, gebe Gas 
und alle andern Autofahrer lenken sofort auf die rechte Fahrbahnspur
Ich komme dann an in deiner Stadt
betätige die quietschende Bremse und steig aus dem Benz
Du zögerst keinen Moment, nimmst reißaus und rennst
Denn wenn ich in deine Villa komme 
und deine Verwandten, diese relativ harmlosen Opfer
Routiniert mit einem Schlagstock geboxt hab
sind sie allesamt zahnlose Opfer
Kid, ich gebe dir den Befehl
geh die CD von Kollegah Minimum 5 mal holen, du Opfer
Denn ich will endlich Gold gehen wie dieser Star Wars-Roboter

Ey mir geht es trotz aufgesetzter Ray Ban-Brille blendend
Showtime, Bitch, wenn dein mädchenhafter, 
schwacher Body nach nem eleganten Uppercut
Auf ähnliche Art wie nasser Sack, 
platschend auf den regennassen Asphalt klatscht
Geb' ich keinen motherfuck auf Rippenbrüche, 
sieh wie ich auf deiner Stirn Kippen zerdrücke
Kid ich bin der Mack und ich verbringe mindestens 80 Tage im Jahr an der Mittelmeerküste
Bleib bis in alle Zeit ein herzensloser
sehr viel Dope tickender Erdbewohner
Eure Ghettostories wirken in etwa so überzeugend wie das dumme Geschwafel einer Märchenoma
Wer will kokaartige Adrenalinschübe, warte ich habe die Garantie
Baller dir wahnsinnige Passagen in rasendem Speed an den Kopf auf erhabenen Hammerbeats
Ich bin im Club und du muckst auf, fängst an herumzuzappeln wie in nem Kung Fu-Film
Aber Nutte was bringen dir deine Kung Fu-Skills
Wenn du nur wild in der Luft rumfuchtelst
Verbeug dich mal lieber, sonst kann es sein, dass heut' Nacht dein Kiefer zerbricht

Nutten die ständig Teile schmeißen wie frustrierte Puzzlefans
Ich tauch' auf in der Stretchlimo, das Pep und Coke-streckende Sexsymbol
Etliche Hoes sind mit auf mich setzen beschäftigt wie im Wettbüro
Kid ich komme zu dir sage 
„Gib mir sofort alle deine Kohle"" und solltest du widersprechen
Werd ich dir mit einem Ellenbogenschlag 
in weniger als einer Millisekunde den Kiefer brechen
Und hinterlasse danach deinen Körper mitten auf der Straße von deinem Viertel vollkommen
Misshandelt übersät, mit unzähligen 
Brandwunden von tausenden auf deiner Haut ausgedrückten Zigaretten
Der King aller Doubletimer
keiner dieser Wannabes im Game ist in der Lage das zu überbieten
Nutte, wenn ich komme klettern deine Leute 
sofort ohne Zögern in die Wipfel der Bäume so wie Orang Utans
Denn sie wissen Kollegah der Mack ist unberechenbar 
und macht in aller Regel immer kurzen Prozess
Mit allen Neidern, die nur hinter seinem Rücken labern 
können und befördert sie mit einem Punch in den Komazustand
Ich lege meinen Anorak ab
zeige dadurch meinen stählernen Body und deine Kifferfreunde
Geraten in Panik, nehmen sofort die Flucht auf 
und sind über alle Berge so wie Gipfelkreuze

Rapper wollen Features kommt und lasst uns über Bares reden
Ich bin Gangster und ich ficke auf die Steuer
Denn ich komm im CLS AMG wie Zigeuner
Der Ex-Kokaticker und nicht 2Pac Mann
Ich hatte mehr mit Weißen zu tun als der Ku-Klux Klan
Ich bin Ausländer und ich suche sofort Palaver
Was Massiv? ich stehe hinter allen Nordafrikanern

Die die Sandsäcke boxen und sich samstags als Tagteam
Gegen 20 fette Ochsen auf der Tanzfläche boxen
Und Hater kenn'n mich nich' doch stell'n in Frage das ich Gangster bin
Da meine Haare etwas heller sind
Und mein Name nicht nach Gangster klingt
Zwar habe ich weit mehr vertickt als sie alle zusammen
Doch darum geht's nicht, damit geb ich nicht an, es ist eh haram
Es geht im Leben nur darum hast du Eier oder nicht
Also laber nicht hinter'm Rücken, sag's mir einfach ins Gesicht
Ich bin kein Riese, doch box mich mit euch allen, wenn ihr wollt
Egal ob ich gewinn oder verlier, ich verteidige mein Stolz

Ich steh ein für Kolle, weil er sowas wie mein Bruder is

Oder wir lassen dir Clown per Faust mal eben

Alter ich hab' dich ja ewig nicht gesehen.“

Sorry, ich will nicht stören. Ich will auch gar nichts haben oder so. Ich hab eh
Neue Connections und so weiter, aber ey
dass man dich mal wieder trifft. Ich hab'
Gesehen ey du bist ja voll der Star, Alter! 
Ich hab gesehen, ey dein Video und so weiter
Du bist im Fernsehen
Ja, ich bin Star jetzt.
Hast du, hast du gut erkannt. Hast du richtig
Erkannt, man. Zahlen bitte
Ähm, Mister Kollegah. Geht auf die Haus. 
Ist immer schön wenn Freunde kommen
Beehren sie uns bald wieder, Mister Kollegah.

Ey voll die Ehre. Ohne Scheiß man! Ey, ich hab gesehen
Du bist voll am Start, man, 
so mit Ferrari im Video, geht voll ab, Alter, ich wollte, ich
Konnte es gar nicht glauben
Brauchst dich nicht anschnallen
Ist okay, lehn dich zurück, mach's dir bequem
Pass auf, wir fahren ein bisschen rum

Ey guck mal, manche werden reich geboren, 
schlafen in Ritz-Hotels
Andere in nem zerrissenen Zelt in der dritten Welt
Und was ich mit selbstverliebten Raps jetzt für Geld verdiene
Geht auf keine Kuhhaut mehr wie ne defekte Melkmaschine
Denn ich wollte schon immer ein Star sein
Und bin's jetzt, doch tickte bevor soweit war Ladungen ungestreckter
Ware an Kunden in den naheliegenden Bundesländern
""Wie viel eigentlich genau?
Schwer zu sagen wie Zungenbrecher

Keine Ahnung, man!
Jaja, ich weiß noch. Sie nannten dich 
ja immer den Mr. Nice von Rheinland-Pfalz und
So ey. Aber ich hab gesehen, 
du hast Video draußen, hast Album da, Alter
Ey das geht richtig
Ab oder was mit dem Album jetzt
Wie läuft das? Geht das voll ab oder was?""

Ja gut ich werd zwar nicht Gold gehen dieses Mal
Aber hören Rapper das Album in Dolby Digital an
Dann sind sie still wie Volvic-Mineralwasser
Und sitzen sprachlos da ohne Worte
Diese Dipset-nachmachenden Horden an
Trittbrettfahrern wie Tony Hawk
Nach seinem Tod ersteigern Kollegah-Fans seine Silberketten
Und bilden aus seinen Silberketten Pilgerstätten
Du wirst in die Geschichte eingehen!
Ja schon, doch wenn ich tot bin hab ich nichts mehr von dem Fame, den Bitches und Moneten
Und den ähnlichen Dingen, die dir im Jenseits nichts bringen
Und die der Teufel dazu nutzt dich von deinem Weg abzubringen
Indem du dein Leben blind verschwendest im Streben nach Dingen
Die lediglich aus Atomen aufgebaute Materie sind
Ja ist was dran!""
Also bete ich denn ich bin nicht bloß hier um ein paar Jahre im Leben

Kommen nicht klar und bleiben auf der CD hängen wie Pepp Reste
Werde zum Mann und lebe nach was ich auf Tracks rappe
Oder bunker weiter Sex-Hefte unter deiner Bettdecke

Ne Dreckswohnung, heruntergekommen wie Ex-Drogenjunks
Schon lange vor Rap begann K zu dem O mit dem Verkauf von Aufputschmitteln
Und immer mehr Leute begannen dann bald jeden Tag an unserem Haus zu klingeln
Und irgendwann fing meine Mum an rauszufinden, weshalb und wieso
War entsetzt denn sie fand irgendwo versteckt in der Bettschublade Dope
Zu der Zeit interessierte ich mich für deutschen Rap nen feuchten Dreck
Andere gingen auf Jams, Kollegah dagegen verteilte an die Leute Pep
Aber entdeckte dann irgendwann sein Talent und wurde vom Hobbyreimer
Binnen 2 Jahren zum Star - Yeah, Bilderbuchkarriere wie Comiczeichner
Ey, jetzt ist mein Album da und die Erwartungen sind hoch

Und ey, ich hatte zwar meistens Glück
Doch es ist wie Bumerangwerfen, die krummen Dinger
Die man dreht, kommen irgendwann auf einen zurück
Sieben Jahre war nie was, ich setzte das Dope an meine Kunden ab
Während die Polizei im Dunkeln tappte so wie bei nem Tunnelschacht
Mit 17 Jahren habe ich auf Kilobasis Gras getickt
Geriet schon relativ früh auf die schiefe Bahn wie Martin Schmitt
Und brachte lange bevor ich mit den äußerst harten Punchlines glänzte
Ladungen Ware von den Niederlanden nach Deutschland über die Frankreichgrenze
Und begann dann irgendwann nebenbei mit Rap und der Hype wurde groß
Aber Kollegah sagte nur „scheiß drauf"" und verteilte weiter das Dope
Und hat sich dann mit Yayo und Speed busten lassen auf dem Weg zum Deal
Bekam Bewährung und ne Geldstrafe, die sich gewaschen hat wie Hygienefreaks
Yeah, anfang '07 und Kollegah beschloss an diesem Tag dieses Kapitel ein für alle Mal zu schließen

Geh durch die Hausflure ins Freie, in der Einfahrt die Karre waschen
Sonnenstrahlen spiegeln sich im silberfarbnen Schmuck
Die milde Abendluft ist voller Grillpartyduft

In den Ortschaftsstraßen cruisen Sportwagen-Cabrios

Die brütende Hitze wird im kühlen Wind verwirbelt
Überall Grillenzirpen, die Lichter der Stadt schimmern
Im Pool im Garten sind die Bitches am Nacktschwimmen
Ich zieh an der Zigarre, den Blick in den Nachthimmel
Denk an alte Kollegen, die inzwischen im Knast sitzen
Sehe zu, wie sich der Havannarauch verflüchtigt
Hol schließlich noch nen weiteren Champagner aus der Küche
Gehe zum Kühlschrank, greif mir paar Flaschen, prüf
Das Eis im Champagnerkühler, eil zur Terrassentür
Und plansch dann mit paar Groupies im dampfenden Jacuzzi
Und ich kümmer' mich nicht drum, ob eins der Nachbarskinder zusieht","30,3"
Kollegah,"Normaler Samstag im Club
Bis auf paar Angsthasen weit 
und breit kein weibliches Wesen, das mich nicht antanzt im Club
Kann jeden Anmachspruch von den Chicks mittlerweile schon
Auswendig und beweg meine Lippen dabei synchron
Diese Bichtes ham kein Niveau, wenn sie ständig die sekundären
Geschlechtsmerkmale an mich pressen, als wenn's aus Versehn wär
Und dann kichern, ey Fräulein, mich intressier'n keine
Groupiehoes, doch zum Trost darfst du mir´n Drink spendier'n, Kleines
Jetzt kuck auf diesen Pimp, Fraun spendier'n ihm Drinks
Taucht er auf in der Diskothek

Es ist der Typ mit dem Big-Boss-Gen
Und das ist, das ist Bad-Boy-Style, das ist Bad-Boy-Style
Der Gee ist am Flow'n, ich liefer das Dope, werde geliebt von den Hoes
Immer wenn sie meine Wenigkeit erblicken wollen die Bitches
Die Nummer meines vergoldeten Mobiletelefons aber

Tu was du willst, doch fick nicht mit dem Bad Boy
Tritt er in den Club, räumen Gs den Weg
Sag was du willst, doch sprich nicht mit dem Bad Boy

Ey, ich lehne an der Bar
Und werde da sowohl von eleganten Damen als auch Mädchen angelabert
Die sich jeden Samstagabend von etwa Sieben bis Elf
Vor den Spiegel stellen, wo sie sich dann meist ziemlich entstellen
Denn die Make-up-Schicht
Auf ihr'm Antlitz ist mehrere Zentimeter dick wie ein Tennisschlägergriff
Ich bin kein Eminem-Verschnitt, doch stets in Bedrängnis wegen Chicks
Die mit ihrer Handycam paar Pics machen
Von dem Gangsterrapper und sich
Jetzt kuck auf diesen Pimp, Fraun spendiern ihm Drinks

Ey der Boss flaniert durch den Club, deine Schlampe kreischt und hat
Bei meinem Anblick 'ne aktivirte Libido wie Kelly Trump
Ich zeig der Slut den Maybach, nachts die Seitengassen meiner Stadt
Ein heißes Pflaster wie im „Hot In Herre“-Video auf Nellys Wange
Ey nachdem ich Samstagabends die kurzfrisierten Haare style
Greif ich zum Öl und reibe dan schön die durchtrainirten Arme ein
Ich bin ein Weiberheld wie'n Geheimagent
Komm ich mit Daimler-Benz, ist Schluss mit heiler Welt
Ich-machte-schon-zu-Grundschulzeiten-als-kleiner-Mensch
Große Coups und das nicht nur im Schreiblernheft

Es ist der Big Boss, Big Boss, Big Boss, Big Boss

Gangsterrap, Big Boss
Er ballert dir vor die Füße bis du cripwalkst
Gib deiner Bitch Stoff, schreitet weltmännisch wie 'n Geograph
Über den Fellteppich aus Leopard
Hochnäsig wie Yayo-Lines, playboyhaftes Life
Hier bist du fehl am Platz wie Kate Moss bei dem Weight-Watchers-Verein
Ich komm im Range Rover vorbei
Gerollt auf Goldfelgen, die Taschen voller Geld

Ich kille dich, bin Revolverheld wie Billy the Kid
Und pumpe Zentner auf der Benchpress, danach gibts große Beefsteaks
Proteinshakes sowie Entenbrust mit French-Dress (Yeah)

Warum ist dann ihre Konsistenz puddingähnlich?

Nutte halt die Fresse und schweig
Ey der Boss hustlet die halbe Nacht
Doch es ist wie Ventilatoren,
Wenn du Wind davon bekommst, wirst du kaltgemacht

Yeah, Ey du kommst aus der Metzgerei, siehst den mattschwarzen
Benz anhalten, die Panzerfensterscheibe gibt langsam
Den Blick ins Innere frei, Bitches springen herbei,
Bitten um ein Autogramm, vom Boss, der den Stoff zentnerweise im Schrank lagert
Ey, guck ich tauche mit Barvermögen
Auf bei der staatsbehördlich laufenden Strafanhörung
Sitze dort im winterlichen Trenchcoat von La Martina
Ey, La Martina wie Frau Hingis bei den French Open
Der Boss auf Rizbo-Beats mit mehr Goldketten als Mister T
Vertickte an ner Bande voller Junkies
in der Regel an nem Ende von ner Woche in der Disco Speed
Tickte Cannabis und andres Zeug an deine Boys, Mois,
Zügel deine Zunge, wenn der Boss am flowen ist
Oder der Kanada-Deutsche ballert auf euch
Und ihr liegt am Boden wie Obdachlose
Der Big Boss, ey meinen ausgeprägten Stiernacken

Kollegah,"Ey, in der Backspin, der Juice, in jedem Heft Interviews mit
Mir und letztlich hast DU mich erst zu dem Rapding ermutigt
Und ich denke zurück, an ein' besonderen Aben
Zu zweit, den folgenden Tag, die weitren Wochen danach:
Du warst ein gutes Mädchen, nie mit dem Gesetz in Konflikt
Alle sagten, du verdientest etwas bessres als mich
dann hat mich dein Vater mit diesem Päckchen erwischt
Doch du bist bei mir geblieben, und der Rest ist Geschichte:
Aus dem lebenden Beweis für das schwache Geschlecht, der aus
Nem Mangel an Selbstvertrauen und Abwehrreflex heraus
Vor allem davonlief, wurde ein anderer Mensch im Lauf
Der Zeit, mein Mädchen, eine waschechte Gangsterbraut
Ich wusste, es gibt keinen, der uns jetzt noch hält
Bonnie und Clyde, es war wir zwei gegen den Rest der Welt
Du warst meine große Liebe, ich war deine große Liebe
Yeah, was konnte uns beiden schon passieren?

(Somebody loves you baby)
yeah die alte Zeit ist vorbei, aber Baby du weißt
(Somebody loves you baby)
bis zum Tag, an dem die Sonne nicht mehr scheint
(Somebody loves you baby
yeah, also hör auf zu wein' denn Baby du weißt
(Somebody loves you baby
bis zum Tag, an dem die Sonne nicht mehr scheint

Wir wollten stets
Mit dem Kopf durch die Wand wie ne Schlagbohrmaschine
Heut hab ich Bravo-Artikel, wie das Aggro Berlin-Camp
Lass dich stundenlang mit Badeölen und Gurkenmasken in Spa verwöhnen
Denn ich weiß, du hast mit mir mehr durchgemacht als Partylöwen
Und ja, ich weiß, es bedrückt dich
Wenn du auf die vergangenen harten Zeiten zurückblickst
Wir war'n nicht reich, aber glücklich
Uns blieb nicht so viel am Monatsende
Doch wir war'n Improvisationstalente
Und machten hin und wieder Dope-Geschäfte
Und machten hin und wieder Dope-Geschäfte
Dann kam Zuhältertape 1, ich wurd bei Selfmade gesignt
Auf Tour, mit Groupies im Backstagebereich
Du liegst im Bett, schläfst nich ein, ich bin auf Aftershowpartys
Komm Tage später nach Haus, mit nem Paar Manolo Blahniks
Und inzwischen begegne
Ich dir häufiger in irgendnem Bericht in den Medien als im richtigen Leben
Du weißt, es ist nicht mein Style, über Gefühle zu schreiben
Doch du sollst wissen, ich vermisse diese früheren Zeiten, Baby

Gebe dann im weiteren Verlaufe des Tages jeder einzelnen der Ladies meinen Schwanz der ziemlich Dick ist
Und ziemlich hart, schrei nicht rum Bitch, love is hard
Der Boss ist da, meine Läufer gehn und verteilen den Stoff im Park
Bringen das Geld am Abend
Motherfucker sieh dir meine Muckies an ich pumpe Kilos, werde von den Kids in deiner Bande gefürchtet wie n Elternabend
Also muck nicht auf, Pussy lauf
Auf und davon oder der Boss verpasst dir mit der Desert Eagle dann nen gezielten Schuss in den Bauch
Und du liegst am Boden in 'ner dunkelroten Pfütze und jetzt sag mal bitte ehrlich das wollen wir doch nicht
Ich erwider deine Frage nach 'ner Zigarette mit einem einfachen 
„Guck auf die Goldkette bitch“
Yeah es ist der, es ist der sportwagenfahrende G
Er kommt mit vorstrafenhabenden, mordwaffenladenden, nordafrikanischen Gees
In deine Ortschaft gefahren, du fliehst, 
ich gebe gas und lenke den Benz durch Nebelschwaden
Roll an deiner Bande voller Rapper vorbei und halte dann den Wagen an in einer Nebenstraße
Befinde mich nie in Depriphasen solche Dinge sind mir nicht bekannt
Ich bin der Mac in diesem Buisness und in der Regel allerhöchstens vor der Freibadsaison mal einige Wochen in der Defiphase

Denn Deutschlands einziger Zuhälterrapper ist mit Pauken und Trompeten BACK
Takeover.. Zeit das meine Pläne Früchte tragen
Ne Menge Wirbel um mich, als wär ich Rückenmark
Ey Bitch, ich bin zurück mit einem unmenschlichen Mörderalbum
Mcees die's hörn verfallen in ängstliche Körperhaltung
Rennen verstört im Wald rum, denn ich bin back und Mc's sehen
Ihre Karrieren auf dem Spiel stehen wie das Nintendo-Emblem
Denn ich nehm glänzende MG's, erledige Fake-Gees
Und sie fressen Blei wie chinesiche Babys
Yeah, ich hab den Schlagstock mit, verprügel die Bahnhofsstricher
Deiner Gang und sie sind hinüber wie Stabhochspringer
Denn diese Rapper und ihre ständigen Moraltexte
Treiben mich bis zum äußersten wie Zentrifugalkräfte

Erfolgene Nachheilen der Molekularteilchen

Auftaucht Kid ich baller durch die Gegend, Nutte alle deine Leute rennen zum Apotheker

Und schicken Küßchensmilies an ihre Onlinefreunde

Straßengröße auf im Benz mit schwarzgetönten Autofenstern

Bilder vom schönsten Vertreter der Homo-Sapiens-Rasse

Von Sonnenstrahlen, an den Stränden von Monte Carlo

Die Sitze bezogen mit Leder aus argentinischer Rinderhaut
Fahre ziellos rum in der Town, lenke die Karre mit Pokerface
Tick Koka H, an deine Mutter, leg keinerlei Wert auf ihr Wohlergehen
Es ist Toni, der rappende Dopehändler
Er demoliert die Gebisse von deinen im Vorgarten chillenden Familymembern
Die Penner benötigen Trostspender
Aber ich baller wie Panzermin trag den Mantel in anthrazit
Steppe dann in die Kabine rein, flow mit der Schnelligkeit eines Transrapids

der Glanz der Welt, doch nichts auf der Erde hält für ewig
Alles was uns bleibt, wenn wir sterben, ist die Seele

Um uns süchtig zu machen nach dem diesseitigen Leben

lassen uns nicht blenden vom vergänglichen Glanz dieser Welt

Koksnasen an Snobs verteil´n auf hochadligen Hochzeitsfeiern
er macht dort Hoes klar, mit bordeauxfarbenen Cocktailkleidern
Danach Widmet er sich dem K.O.-Schlagen von Boxweltmeistern

Ich verlass das Gelände, jetzt ist Sense
Es ist Kollegah, der King in der Hood
Ey ich bin stilvoll gekleidet, ihr hässlich
Blauer Zigarrendunst liegt in der Luft
Und vom Frühling bis zum Winter ist er in der Hood
Der King in der Hood, Kollegah, ich bin die Hood
ey und die Hater kucken, denn
Ich durchkämm im Playerlock der Neighbourhood im Benz

Und er ist in der Hood, Kollegah der King der Hood
Egal ob bei tropischen Temparaturen oder bei Winterluft
Halt dich im Hintergrund
Wenn er die Hood im Mercedes durchkämmt oder er zieht die Gun und macht kurz mal den Abzugsfinger krumm
Ey komm ich in dein Dorf, im mattschwarzen Porsche, hüpfen
Deine im Garten grillenden Nachbarn in Dornenbüsche
Denn die Anlage macht mehr Krach als 'ne Horde Büffel
(Denn) die Boxen haben mehr Watt als die Nordseeküste",In Der Hood
Kollegah,"Ey, Playerhater guck, der Überpimp ist back
Lässt die Bitches laufen im Japaner-Schülerinnen-Dress
Und bitte rede nicht, die Uhr und der Ferrari seien Luxusgüter
Ich zeig dir den Wert in Bar wie ein Luftdruckprüfer
Betätige den elektrischen Fensterheber des Cadillac Escalade,
Fahr shoppen mit 'ner pechschwarzen American-Express-Magnetcard
Und schaue nicht auf Preis- und Sonderausstattungspakete
Sondern auf Handschuhfachgröße und Kofferraumfassungsvermögen
Yeah, während vor meinem Haus mit Kameras in Rosenbüschen
Schlampen abends Fotos knipsend spannen so wie Bogenschützen
Ticke ich gelbe Paste aus Amphetamin-Drogenküchen
An Junkies auf dem Schorestrich und manchmal auch an Modepüppchen
Große blonde Mädels, in der Modebranche tätig
Und grad frisch vom Catwalk kommend so wie Pfotenspuren im Schnee
Ich lass den Pit Bull Terrier los
Und du liegst wie Diskuswerfer fix und fertig
Halbtot mit Meniskuszerrung am Boden!

Ey ich komme in deine Gegend, Leute weinen Tränen
Es ist Kollegah der Boss, mit beutelweise Schnee
Ich komm mit 'ner Bande Gees, die nach Meutereien Schrägstrich
Räubereien täglich Euroscheine zählen
Das ist Kokamusik, der totale Krieg
Du sitzt lieber bei dein' Eltern auf dem Sofa und liest
Denn dir ist sowas zu viel
Ey das ist kein Battlerap,
Das ist Messerstecher-Stresserrap, Kokamusik (Kokamusik)

Yeah, ey ich stemme Kilos auf Hantelbänken
Überquer mit Kilos die Landesgrenzen
Höre wie mein Rufton klingelt
Es ist deine Mum, ich drücke sie weg, als wär es Sumo-Ringen

Und schaff' mein Geld in die Schweiz, vorbei an der Steuer
Amsterdam ist meine zweite Heimat nach Deutschland
Und ich bring wieder weiße Weihnacht nach Deutschland
Was Hustler, Mois, du bist Fleischereifachverkäufer
Playerhater renn, das ist Selfmade
Ich erniedrige Wannabe-Gangsterrapper aus L.A
Ey und wenn sie sehen, wie ich den Gebrauch der Gun übe
Machen sich deine Bodyguards aus dem Staub, wie Sandstürme
Ey während Frauen sich bei deim' Anblick biegen vor lachen
Überstehen sie meinen nicht ohne multiple Orgasmen
Meine Jeanshosentaschen sind prallgefüllt mit Scheinen
Statt Ersatzreifen im Kofferraum ein halbes Kilo Weißes
Nebenbei bemerkt haben die diamantenbesetzten Watches
Die das Handgelenk des Bosses zieren, 'ne Stange Geld gekostet
Ey das ist Kokamusik, das ist der totale Krieg
Bitch dir ist sowas zu viel

Ey ich komme in deine Gegend, Leute weinen Tränen
Es ist Kollegah der Boss, mit beutelweise Schnee
Ich komm mit 'ner Bande Gees, die nach Meutereien Schrägstrich

Du sitzt lieber bei dein' Eltern auf dem Sofa und liest
Denn dir ist sowas zu viel
Ey das ist kein Battlerap
Das ist Messerstecher-Stresserrap, Kokamusik (Kokamusik)

Kollegah ? Das war krass auf jeden Fall
Aber ich hab ein Bitte an dich
Kannst du vielleicht nochmal
So so krass aufnehemn weißt du wie früher

Ja klar, für meine Fans doch gerne, pass auf

(Mutterficker)

Mutterficker das ist Kokamusik
Ich komme, zieh die Gun und sorg für den totalen Krieg,
So wie Omaha-Beach
Stepp in den Club und baller mir Nasen in dem Wert von deinem Monatsverdienst
Komm und hole dich bei Nacht aus deiner spießigen Doppelhaushälfte
Du siehst nur noch den sich schließenden Kofferraumdeckel
Nie mehr Tageslicht, nie wieder Sonnenaufgänge
Nur noch kurz ein auf dich zielendes Shotgunlauf-Ende
Ich komm mit Gewaltanwendern aus den Balkanländern
Bitches fächern mir Luft zu mit Palmenblättern
Hab im Ledermantel Weißes, leg auf elegante Weise
Meterlange Lines, bin high wie Alpengletscher
High wie Falkennester, durchkreuze deine Gegend
Es ist der Big Boss, mit beutelweise Schnee
Er kommt mit 'ner Bande Gees, die nach Meutereien Schrägstrich
Räubereien täglich Euroscheine zählen
Ich trag unter beiden Armen dicke Geldsäcke
Parke den SL, checke ein in dem Loft
Einer renommierten Hotelkette,
Stepp über den hellgelben Fellteppich
Baller mir ne Line in den Kopf bleibe Boss
Und man munkelt, Bitch dass ich unterm Strich
Circa alle 14 Tage deine Mutter fick
Und das immer erst nachdem ich ihren Ausweis gecheckt hab
Um zu sehn, ob das auch wirklich deine Mutter ist
Der Boss steppt in die Hood, schwere Wolken am Himmel
Doch er ist sonnenbebrillt als wär's ein Sommeridyll
Und er macht selten Angaben darüber, wie viel er vertickt hat
Aber wenn, dann sind die stets in Tonne, wie Müll
Yeah, ich komme mit der Gun in deine Bude rein
Und demütige deine Mum auf ganz üble Weise
Geb ihr Schellen und schon lässt sie das Dampfbügeleisen
Elegant über meine Anzüge gleiten!

Auf einen wie ihn haben sie schon viel zu lange gewartet
All die Leute träumten von 'nem deutschen Act
Der keine abgefuckte Hoe war wie 99,9 Prozent 
Doch er war damals in der Hood und hatte eigene Sorgen
Das erste Tape hab ich damals noch ganz alleine recordet
Nur für paar Internetkids und mit Billig-Equipment
Paar Wochen später dann im Studio dann die X-Mas-Edition
Und viele meinten damals „Ey, das lässt sich nicht nochmal toppen!“
Doch ich drängte mit Boss der Bosse den Rest in die Opferrolle
Legte wiederum nach, mein Debutalbum chartete
Heut hab ich's geschafft yeah vom Dealer zum Star
Und bin der Beste hier, werde mit King of Rap betitelt
Dabei mach ich meine Arbeit mal eben so mit links wie Zeldaspieler

Auf dem Weg nach oben, der amerikanische Traum
Nie mehr über die Grenze, zum Materialienkauf
Vor nicht mal zwei Jahren, da tickte ich noch Pep in der Hood
Heute hat ganz Deutschland auf die Goldkette geguckt
Ich hab Verkaufszahlen erreicht und geriet dabei dank raptechnisch
Herausragender Leistung zu 'ner Ausnahmeerscheinung
Einem Aushängeschild, das seitdem hauptsächlich mit
Preise abstauben zu tun hat wie meine Haushälterin
Und nach dem nächsten Kollegah-Album ergänzt die Trophäensammlung
Das ein oder andere Mitbringsel von der letzten Comet-Verleihung

Muskulatur, guck auf die Uhr, hundertste Kur, wer will was
Beleidige die Penner so wie Tony Montana 
Und die vielen Patienten, weil der Lowkick zu hart war
Benötige die Kohle, gucke Nutten hinterher, guck, 
Der Banger, ficke deine Ma, die Nutte, hinter'm Herd
Okay der Vato Loco, denn der Köter ist back, 
Der Banger, Verbrecher, der König des Raps

Die Härtesten im Land (Bitch, wir ticken Koks
An deinen Anwalt, das ist Rap für Schwerverbrecher, lan)
Jung, Brutal, Gutausseh'nd knallt deine Crackbitch

Und zu der Zeit, als er noch Arschfickmann hieß

Tickte ich bis drei Uhr nachts Piece

Ich bin Mafiosi, Assi Toni, schieß auf die Gs
Wer ist Logarithm, ich komme mit nie mehr for free
Die Polizei meint, der Verbrecher soll sitzen
Doch haben nichts in der Hand wie Samy beim Wichsen
Und mit mir fickt auf der Straße keiner
Denn ich schlage Weiber wie ein Sklaventreiber
Die Sekte macht Welle, doch ich fick die Rapper
Schutzgeld und ihr seid am Blechen wie Pizzabäcker
Deine Ma macht sich fürs Anschaffen schick
Sie ist eine kleine Hure, die ich anschaffen schick
Die Straße kuckt zu wie der Tausendste Welle schiebt
Farid Bang, ich geh jetzt auf Frauen los wie Emily

Ins Gesicht, ich hab 'nen Koffer voll Stoff und Machinegunclips
Ey, der Betäubungsmittelticker, was ich in meiner Freizeit mache
Was ich soll ich da erzähl'n, ich trage Gold und ficke Mütter
Und zwar desinteressiert, du sagst Deutschland hat kein Ghetto
Dann hab ich auf dem Weg zu Farid wohl die Grenze passiert
Ich komm mit Gangstern zu dir, die ausseh'n wie Shaquille O'Neal
In meinem Wortschatz gibt es kein Begriff wie Selbstironie
Ich habe Stretchlimousin' und off'ne Geländewagen
Und du kannst dich nicht mehr ins off'ne Gelände wagen
Ich brech Verkaufsrekorde, doch hab längst ausgesorgt
Mein Kontostand setzt sich aus mehr Stellen zusammen als dein Bauerndorf
Muskeln wie Arnold Schwarzennegger, schusssich're Panoramafenster
Wir füll'n deine Bitch mit dem russischen Nationalgetränk ab
Bangen sie zu siebt und hängen dann im Casino
Denn Geld spielt keine große Rolle wie Danny DeVito

Ein Uppercut, du hebst ab, deine Freundin glotzt verwundert
Auf die Uhr und fragt genervt „Ey, kommt der heut auch noch mal runter?“
Kollegah, der Boss, ey yo, ich komm an in Pelzmänteln
Bitches sagen „Toni, kannst du auch noch mal so schnell rappen?“
Siktir, lan, es macht Klick, Klick, Bam, Kid, 
ich ficke deine Mutter mit dem dicksten Schwanz
Den die Welt je geseh'n hat, ey, 
der Pelzmantelträger gibt dir Penner nur den Uppercut und bricht dir dann
Deine Rippen, du Nuttensohn, ich zerfick deine Mutter, 
komm und verticke das Pulver dann an die Kids im Block
Komm und fick dein Kopf, ey, du machst auf Ghettorapper,

Ich vertick den Stoff in dem Viertel, wo du wohnst, 
an deine Kinder, Mutterficker, du wirst weggefickt
Bis dein Becken bricht, ich komm mit Farid 
in dein Haus, sage zu deiner Mutter „Mach uns was zu essen, Bitch“
Ihr seid lächerlich, meine Kette blitzt, 
denn die Anti-Cordon-Rapper geben Dick an deine Mutter
Ficken deine Mutter, sie verticken Crack an Kids, 
das ist Gangstershit, ey, wir zieh'n dir dein Schmuck ab
Und vergewaltigen dann deine Schwester daheim in ihr'm Kinderbett
Ich bin der Mac, K zu dem O, der Typ, der deine Freunde behindert schlägt

Sammelt Kiefernholzmobiliar aus dem 17. Jahrhundert

Bring' den Trizeps in Form, den Bizeps in Form
Und definier' den Körper wie'n Anatomielexikon

Siehst du auf meine haushohen Plasmascreens
Kuck auf dein' Body, du bist im Fitnessverein

Kuck auf die Bitches, wie sie kreischen, der Boss tritt in die Eisen
Bis die Bridgestone-Reifen durchdrehen wie Jack Nicholson in „Shining“
Kuck aufs Ziffernblatt der Breitling, kuck auf die Hater
Wie sie im Netz haten, doch im Real Life Blickkontakt vermeiden
Kuck auf mein Business, für die Liste der zehn Reichsten
Fehlt nur'n klitzekleiner Tick, wie wenn Trick und Track zu zweit sind
Es ist Kollegah, Muskelberg, ich laufe mit Luftgewehr
Und Schuhen aus Krokodil in der Hood umher
Paar Shots durchsieben dein Nuttenherz
Du Tucke nervst, hör auf den Boss, hol mir deine Mutter her
Und wir verbringen die Zeit mit Doktorspielen wie Guttenberg

Ey, ich lass' wenn sie die Regel haben, Mädels blasen jeden Abend
Gebe Gas im Range Rover, fahre zu deiner Bitch
Ey, ihr Sexlife spielt sich ab, wenn du nicht da bist wie Mailboxansagen
Vor Jahren tickte ich Stoff an Kids auf Skateboardanlagen
Heut sehen sie staunend zu wie der Boss ein bisschen melodramatisch
Im Licht der Neonreklamen cool vorm Maybach steht
Du stehst höchstens vorm VW, wie U im Alphabet
Ich bin multitaskingfähig, halt die Uzi an dein' Schädel
Drücke ab und geb's dabei grad zwanzig Groupies parallel
Kid, und ich hoff', dass du mich da verstehst
Ein Uppercut und du fliegst in die Umlaufbahn vom Jupiterplanet
See u later, du Bitch, erzähl nich', was für'n Player du bist
Denn der Boss rollt durch die Neighborhood, sitzt
Hinter mokkabraun getönten Fenstern mit Chicks im fetten Beamer
Kofferraumvermögen sechshundertsiebzig Hektoliter
Voll gestrecktem Pep, ich vercheck' die Packets an Ghetto Dealer
Der Chauffeur manövriert den King so wie Tekkenspieler
Du Crackbitch bettelst mich nett an, dich auf deim Track zu featuren
Weg mit dir, man, deine Raptexte sind whack, versteck dich lieber
Oder der Mac hält Magnums und Tecs an dein' Head und streckt dich nieder
Fetzt dich weg und du liegst da verletzt im Dreck mit zerfetzten Gliedern
Kid, ich gleite über die Meeresoberfläche
Auf 'nem Segelboot, bespreche dort am Telefon Geschäfte
Mach' nachts in Edelclubs mit Szenedrogen Cash
Tick Coke und Es an Prominente aus der Regenbogenpresse
Geh' mit AK-47 auf dich los, denn du machst auf Pimp
Aber daheim sieht man deine Bitch dann im Befehlston mit dir sprechen
Du musst zuhören, nicken und die Fußböden wischen
Denn du stehst unterm Pantoffel so wie Schuhgrößen, Bitch
Meine Crew tötet dich, man sieht Blut strömen bis
Es Richtung Himmel in die Flughöhe von Zugvögeln spritzt
Und du hast Angst um deine Sister, hab' ich Gigs in deiner Stadt
Denn letztes Jahr hatte ich ja bereits den Dick in deiner Slut
Und du sprichst von Heirat, doch ich treff' deine Chick im Nightclub
Ein, zwei Whiskey und sie sitzt im Maybach
Es braucht nich' viel Einsatz, bis die Bitch sich freimacht
Der Aufwand is' ein minimaler wie Disney-Zeichner
Und ich seh ihren Stringtanga
Denn ihr Minirock is' knapper als Trinkwasser in Kinshasa
Ich mach' ihr Hoffnungen, den Pimp zu heiraten
Und sie freut sich wie ein Kind zu Weihnachten
Und sie reagiert auf mein bestes Teil mit Schreckensschreien
Auf deins auch, aber nur wegen deinen Geschlechtskrankheiten
Es wär besser für dich, jetzt zu schweigen
Oder von der Brücke zu springen und wegzutreiben mit Rettungsreifen
Denn siehst du den Mac aus dem Lexus steigen
Steht dein Leben auf Messers Schneide wie das Nesmuk-Zeichen
Zwischen dein' Homes und meinen gibt's nen Größenunterschied
Denn meine Homies sind Schränke wie bei „Die Schöne und das Biest“
Und du willst dein' Kadett parken, doch siehst den pechschwarzen
Aston und erstarrst, denn sowas kennst du nur von Quartettkarten
Ich lass' deine Geliebte blowen, diese Ho
Hat dann zwar nur einen Schwanz zu blasen
Dennoch ist die Auswahl riesengroß
Kid, und du schreibst paar Punchlines auf das Blatt
Doch ich komm' und box' dich um und du willst Anzeige erstatten
Ey, kein Ding, mach nur! Denn guck, deine Crackbitch
Behandelt mich vor Gericht wie ihren Esstisch und deckt mich
Renn zu den Bullen, aber du stirbst
Nachdem du gesungen hast als seist du Nate Dogg

Kollegah,"Ich sitz' im Studio, starr' auf die grauen Tapeten
Draußen Dauerregen, drinnen blauer Nebel
Atme den Weed-Smoke aus, in den Augen Tränen
In der Hand die Knarre, ich denk dran aufzugeben
Denn sie ist nicht mehr da, im Haus herrscht Leere
Und ich such jeden Morgen nach 'nem Grund aufzustehen
Homies rufen an, doch ich will kaum noch reden
Sie war die Eine, die Frau für's Leben
Jetzt ist sie weg, gezwungen zur Heirat mit
Irgendeinem Großcousin aus ihrer Heimat, shit
Irgendein Bastard, den sie davor vielleicht einmal trifft
Er weiß sie nicht zu schätzen, doch besitzt sie, life's a bitch
Und ich red' mir verzweifelt ein, eines Tages nehm'
Ich sie wieder in die Arme im Garten Eden
Über den Wolken im Himmel
Kokain ist der Teufel, doch er betäubt meine Sinne
Ich baller Lines mit den Homies und lenke mich ab vor der Playsi
Werd' nie wieder schlafen und halte mich tagelang wach
Denn ich träum' jede Nacht von meinem Baby
Sie hielt mich von Sünden ab, meine Lady
Jetzt sitz ich hier wieder und zieh' Coke
Ich wurde zum besseren Menschen durch sie
Jetzt kille ich wieder die Zeit in der Spielo
Doch ich gebe keinen Fick, sie ist weg und ich zieh' los
Verspiele das Geld für die Villa für unsere Familie im Casino
Geh' Richtung Sonnenuntergang auf den Bahngleisen
Entweder sie oder gar keine

Du, du, weißt du denn nicht
Du warst alles für mich
Du, du, sag mir, siehst du denn nicht
Wie sehr es mich trifft, dass du nicht hier bist
Du, du, reicht es dir nicht
Ich gab alles für dich
Du, du, jetzt liebst du mich nicht
Mein Herz, das zerbricht, mein Ende in Sicht

Seit Wochen nich' rasiert, exe die Jack Daniels-Reste
Jalousien zu, starr' mit nem leeren Blick
Aufs Fernsehtestbild, nehm' 'ne Antidepressiva
Raus aus der Tablettenpackung
Seh' uns're Ringen zwischen leeren Zigarretenschachteln
Und ich seh an der Wand die leere weiße Fläche
Wo damals die Bilder hingen
In einer Hand zerrissene Fotos von uns
Und in der anderen Hand die beiden Silberringe
Spüre den Schmerz tief in der Brust
Renn' dann in's Bad, hau dann den Spiegel kaputt
Wisch die Tränen mit den blutigen Händen
Aus dem Gesicht, atme schwer und kriege kaum Luft
Ich hasse die Welt, hasse mich selbst
Denk' an die Zeit, geh' mit der Erinnerung ins Bett
Schlaf' zwei Tage lang, werde nich' wach
Handy seit paar Wochen aus, ich glaub ich schmeiß es weg
Denn sie ruft sowieso nich' an
Es rufen allerhöchstens meine Homies an
Doch ich will kein' seh'n
Riesige Wohnung, Isolation und Selbstmitleid, ich ertränke in Trän'
Momente, die wir hatten, sie verschwinden im Nebel
Zünde mir 'ne Zigarette an, blas' den Rauch raus aus dem Fenster
Ich glaub', ich spring' raus aus dem Fenster
Seh' von oben herab auf die Stadt und ich trau' mich nich'
Zöger noch ein' kurzen Augenblick
Steige von der Fensterbank, zieh mir 'ne Jacket an
Ich laufe raus in die Hood, kauf' mir Shit
Boxe dem Dealer die Nase rot
Komme nich' klar, ich suche mir 'ne Bank
Drehe mir 'nen Blunt, mach ihn an
Sitz allein in der Nacht in dem Park
Ich bin völlig nass, kalter Regen fällt und erlöscht den Blunt
Aber leider nich' den Schmerz
Und die höllische Qual, fühle mich wie paralysiert
Wie konnte ich sie damals verlier'n?
Warum immer ich? Immer ich, innerlich alles erfriert
Mir war nie bewusst, was für 'ne Schönheit sie is'
Ich meinte es ernst, als ich sagte: ""Schatz, ich würde töten für dich""
Doch ich hoffe, jetzt tötet es mich
Warte jeden Tag auf die Erlösung im Licht
Nehme 'ne Pille, nehme noch 'ne Pille, mache weiter
Lehne mich zurück auf der Bank
Schau' zum Himmel hoch, ich gebe keinen Fick auf mein Leben
Schlafe ein mit dem Gedanken

Nie wirklich arm, doch konnte nachts trotzdem nie ruhig schlafen
Wegen Kilogramm-Packungen Speed, Crack und Gras

Es war Drogen verchecken, um Kautionen zu blechen
Und überzogene Rechnungen der Wohnung zu decken
Da-da damals war es Bolzplatz, heute is' es Golfplatz
Heute is' es Geldsäcke schleppen in die Volksbank

Sie zögert und meint, sie sei keine Schlampe wie der Rest
Keine Groupie-Bitch, die man bangt und dann wieder verlässt
Sie hat Angst, dass sie sich verliebt und Angst, dass sie verletzt wird
Ich lächel', reich' ihr kurz den Blunt und sie relaxt, sagt:
""Eigentlich bist du gar nich' so arrogant wie in dein' Tracks""
Und um zwanzig vor 6 liegt sie schlafend in mei'm Arm
Und ich tipp' in mein Handy mit der linken Hand diesen Text
Momentaufnahme aus dem Leben eines Players
Frauenherzen schlagen für Kollegah
Als wär'n sie seine Bodyguards, doch es is' schwer
Ein gutes Mädchen zu finden, wenn du fame bist und Money hast
Irgend'ne Bitch schickt 'ne SMS
Ihr Freund sei zwar nett, aber langweilig und schlecht im Bett
Ich antworte nicht, leg' das Handy weg
Schließ' die Augen, denk' an mein Baby, hoff', sie is' happy jetz'

Du warst so gut für mich und ich hab' es jetz' gemerkt
Ich hasse dich, Player
Ich hasse dich, Player

Ich wach' auf, hör' in der Dusche das Wasser laufen
Die Tür geht auf, sie kommt raus mit nasser Haut
Kommt ans Bett, beugt sich über mich, küsst mich sanft
Und dabei fällt ihr nasses Haar in mein Gesicht, es riecht nach Shampoo
Sie wickelt sich ein Handtuch um die Hüften, zieht sich an
Und schaut mir traurig in die Augen: ""Sag, versprichst du, dass du anrufst?""
Klar, Shawty, und jetz' lass die Fragen
Und geh, dein Taxi wartet, es wird still
Und ich muss wieder an sie denken, versuch', mich abzulenken
Bin nur im Studio wie die Truman Show
Doch es hilft nichts
Ich bin allein in einer Welt voller Sex, Drugs und Groupie-Hoes
Und ich bin in dieser Welt gefang', sie war ein Engel
Rein, doch ich bin ihr mit 'ner Menge Schlampen fremdgegang'

Sie zu vergessen, im Sommer geht's
Doch es geht schwerer, wenn die Temperaturen
Immer seltener ins Plus gehen
Die Zeit, in der die Blätter durch die Luft wehen
Und Kids in dicken Sweatern durch die Hood gehen
Dieses Leben is' seltsam, Bro
Ich geh' durch den Park, zieh' den Fellkragen hoch
Zünd' 'ne Kippe an, auf dem Handy ein Anruf
Irgendeine Jenny aus Frankfurt
Ich zwing' mich, ranzugehen, sag: ""Hey Baby, was geht?""

Kollegah,"Kid, ich bin der Mac in diesem Business 
Und ticke dicke Packets an die Kids
Step mit der glitzernden Kette in den Club
Zerre deine Bitch auf Toilette
Und ficke der den arroganten Blick aus der Fresse
Du holst dir mein Album und sagst, ich bin der Beste
Doch ich dreh' mit deiner Mutter Porn-Tapes
Komm in deine Villa mit der Basy, gebe deinem Body Punches
Alle deine Rippen zerbersten wie Cornflakes
Keiner dieser Rapper kann so viele Bitches
Zu der selben Zeit in zehn Städten haben
Ohne, dass die Weiber irgendwann checken, was abgeht
Kid, ich hab' allein in deiner City circa sieben oder acht Babes, was geht?
Und ich mache Business und tick' an all die Sluts H
Roll' in deine City rein im silbernen Lex
Mache deine Lady, die du liebst, zu deiner Ex
Sie vergöttert meinen Body, Kid, ich baller mir das Flex
Habe dann noch mit der Nutte circa sieben Stunden Sex
Alle Gs in deiner Town wissen, mein Wort is' hier Gesetz
Kid, ich komme mit der goldenen Kette
Baller dir Wannabe da voll in deine Fresse, besser renn in dein Versteck
Rapper wollen gern eine Kollabo
Kommen an und callen dann den Mac am Handy, leider ist immer besetzt
Denn ich hab keine Zeit für diese Penner
Kid, ich mache lieber Business in Holland
Habe kiloweise Pep in dem Kofferraum und roll über den Zoll
Ich mache Money mit der Ware, Motherfucker, komm mir nich' mit deinem Rap
Ich habe leider keinen Nerv für deine „supertollen“ Tracks
Deutscher Rap is' eine Bitch und ich versorge sie mit Crack
Mache mit der Nutte Cash, und es wird immer mehr wie von allein
Kid, ich habe 'nen Lauf wie meine Tec
Gebe keinen Fick auf deine Gang, komm an und zücke meine Gun
Baller dir Kugeln in dein Head und du verreckst

Uzi-Läufe schwarz wie die Mondfinsternis
Ziele mit der Gun, kille deine Gang, rolle weg im Jeep
Baller Luden tot und das Rotlicht erlischt
Kugeln in der Luft, renne durch die Hood, volles Magazin
Gucci-jacket weiß, das is' Koksticker-Biz
Lege mir 'ne Line, rolle mir 'nen Blunt, holländisches Weed
Lass die Lady tanzen auf dem Wohnzimmertisch
Ich zerfetze Rapper mit 'nem Messer, besser gib mir deine Kette
Penner renn, ich bin der King in dem Block

Koksticker-biz
Ich spanne meine Muskeln an und erzeuge damit eine Mondfinsternis
Rapper ballern Steroide, machen dann auf harten Bodybuilder
Doch blicken zu Boden, wenn sie Kollegah trifft
Und ich gebe keinen Fick auf deine Doubletime-Flows
Ich vertick' an deine Mama das Coke
Sie kann nicht bezahlen, denn die Bitch hat keine Kohle
Gar kein Ding, ich lass die Nutte vor der Kamera blown, uh
Und du siehst im Internet
Wie deine Rap-Idole gerne auf Über-G mit Taschen voller Money machen
Aber kleine Insider-Info
Die meisten dieser Penner sind in ihrem wahren Leben geradezu broke
All' die dicken Karren in den Clips sind nur geliehen
Die Bitches haben nich' mal 'nen Führerschein, das ist alles nur Show
Der einzige, der real geblieben ist, in diesem Game voller Versager
Bitch, ist Kollegah, der Rest sind alles Hoes
Und du weißt, ich könnte wenn ich will
Alle diese sogenannten Rapper-Karrieren
In diesem Land ohne Probleme zerficken
Mit einem einzigen Track
Aber dafür bin ich leider viel zu busy mit anderen Sachen
Wie zum Beispiel ihre Mütter ficken
Nachdem diese Bitches meine Villa sauber machen
Mir dann liebevoll den Nacken massieren und dann auf allen Vieren gehen
Mit Augen, die vor Freude glänzen wie der Mond
Oder die Felgen an dem Benz voller Chrom
Komm mir dumm und ich halte dir die Tec an den Head
Zieh dann den Trigger, Mutterficker du bist tot
Und alle deine Möbel in der Wohnung werden rot
Wie die Augen deiner Mutter, wenn sie weint um ihren Sohn
Es ist der Boss, ich durchstreife im Maybach das Viertel
Die meisten MCs haben keinerlei Würde
Sie ficken nur Crack-Schlampen
Ich stoße Chicks von der Bettkante, die sie heiraten würden

Uzi-Läufe schwarz wie die Mondfinsternis
Ziele mit der Gun, kille deine Gang, rolle weg im Jeep
Baller Luden tot und das Rotlicht erlischt

Bis die ersten Vögel zwitschern, Sonnenaufgang, 10 nach sechs
Ich check' im Handschuhfach, wie viel noch da is' alles weg
Ab zum Drive-In, bestell' sechs Cheeseburger

Doch ich sitz' in meinem Penthouse-Loft
Sage, fickt euch alle!, zieh' 
'ne Line und fühl' mich wie'n Gangster-Boss
Vor mir auf dem Tisch 50k plus ein Zentner Stoff
Ich ruf' nach meinem Baby, sie kommt an mit gesenktem Kopf
Ich winke sie zu mir, heb' ihr Kinn, sie hat probiert
Ihr blaues Auge mit Schminke zu kaschier'n
Sie schaut mich an mit leerem Blick
Ich hör' in Zeitlupe, wie sie sagt
„Ich kann nich' mehr, du bist nicht der gleiche, 
Der du mal warst, es is' aus""
WAS? Ich tick' aus und so schnell sie kann
Rennt sie zur Tür, ich schmeiß' 'ne Vase, sie zerschellt an der Wand
Ich renn' ihr nach in den Flur, du ehrenlose Bitch!
Wer hat dich damals aus dem Dreck geholt? Was wärst du ohne mich?
Egal, ich brauch' sie nicht, ich brauch' niemand', ich hab' Money
Mache Money, stecke Money in die Jeans von Armani
Steck' mein' Kopf in den Koka-Berg, sniffe es pur
Hebe den Kopf, höre Schritte im Flur
Sie treten meine Tür ein, ich öffne die Schublade
Und steck' das Magazin in die Schusswaffe

Du siehst, die Kleine schnappt nach Luft wie ein geisteskranker Hund
Und sein Herz (pumpt, pumpt) Adrenalin, Bitch
Doubletime in Topspeed, Hustler-Rap auf Boss-Beats
(Was bringt dir 'ne Kutte, wenn ich dir in deinen Kopf schieß'
Ihr hattet 'ne friedliche Zeit)
Doch Boss und Banger sind back, der Adrenalinspiegel steigt",Adrenalin
Kollegah,"Ey yo, der kanadadeutsche Hustler, jeder deiner Ballermann-Freunde macht Platz
Ich seh aus, als ob meine Mama mich damals mit Anabol säugte statt
Mit Muttermilch, guck, ich chill' in der Hood, wo du billige Nutte so oft vor mir wegliefst
Dass du mittlerweile schon die Kondition eines Marathonläufers hast
Ich starte den Krieg, jage mit Farid MCs wie die Taliban Amerikaner
Wir laden AK-Magazine nach, ziehen dann scharf und dein Team kriegt Panik und flieht
Ich flow hart mit dem Beat, ein Schlag, du liegst, JBG 2 wird nach dem Release von
Straßen-Gs und hunderten Girls rauf und runtergehört wie Fahrstuhlmusik
Meine Anatomie ist stahlhart so wie diese Stadt aus Beton
Wo ich grad diesen Song schreib und dabei Blowjobs von 'ner Mulattin bekomm, im Bugatti Veyron
Und es ist Fakt, ich bin Don, lege wie James Bond Sluts flach, was, du willst fronten
Du hast so viel Chancen wie 'n unbewaffneter Bonze nachts in der Bronx, Bastard, ich komm
In dein Haus mit Farid, du siehst die Muskelprotze
Du plünderst dein Sparschwein, denn es ist wieder mal Zeit für (Schutzgeld, Fotze)
Du bist immer noch ein Nichts, ich immer noch der Typ
Der Gs beim Händeschütteln aus versehen die Fingerknochen bricht

Wir verhauen dich mit 'ner Hantel, echte Frauen stehen auf Kanten

Lass das Tape laufen wie wir draußen nachts deine Schlampe, Kid
Ich glaub, du hast verstanden, wir sind unterwegs im Boss-Modus

Ey, ich bin Godfather, Block-Hustler, Gangbanger, Rapper
Golf 3 ist cool, doch der Benz steht mir besser
Ich mach Mucke für Gangs und Verbrecher
Das letzte, das du hörst, ist das Bang der Beretta

Kriminelle Bodybuilder wollen Welle machen, ich baller mir 'ne Pille, denn wir nehmen Anabol
Alle Weiber kommen elegant in den Benz, ich ficke deine billige Bitch jetzt
Wie viele Kokaticker machen Politik und ficken deiner Mutter die Clit weg
Ficke Pädophile mit der Pumpgun, komm mit einem Butterfly, ich fick Rap
Das Cash nehme ich dir vor deiner ganzen Bande ab
Du bist ein Hundesohn, gebe dir 'nen Uppercut
Jetzt ist Massaker, ich bleibe ein echter G
Und sehe rot wie Zidane bei seinem letzten Spiel
Ich verteil Ohrfeigen
Und fühle nichts wie Bitches, die in deine Short greifen
Und der Anschlag auf diese verfeindete Crowd
Wird von 'nem Taliban ausgeführt wie verschleierte Frauen

Ich, denn ihr trefft mich im Club mit übler Miene

2 Proll-Rapper mit der Hand an der Glock, wir gehen ab wie Cagefights
Machen dann aus deinem Spastiface Brei, Tape 2, MCs fall'n auf die Knie
Ey, es ist kalt in den Streets, ich halte den Chief, vergewaltige Gs
Und egal ob ich Rapper mit der Pumpgun erschieß' oder alternativ mit der Walther zersieb'
Es geht bam bam bam, jeder Ballermann knallt eine Hand Punks auf den Asphalt in den Streets
Und ich ticke wieder Cannabis an deine Mama, mache dann 'ne Mille bar bei illegalen Pokerduellen
Öffne dann damit einige Nobelbordelle, geh das Koka bestellen bei Drogenkartellen
Fliege dann im Nebel über Ozeanwellen nach Polen, bange dort einige Fotomodelle
Komm im Anzug nachts, allein mein Handschuhfach ist doppelt so groß wie deine Wohnungstoilette
Und du willst ein Battle mit dem Überboss und bitte mach mal langsam, lass es lieber
K zu dem O mit der Magnumpistole, neben mir wirkt Van Damme wie Justin Bieber
Ich fliege nach Afrika, mache Safari-Jagd mit Pumpguns vom Waffendealer
Komme in mein Haus und ich zeige dir mehr Tierköpfe an der Wand als ein Schattenspieler

Komm in den Club an Mitternacht, Hoes suchen Blickkontakt
Der Big Boss macht dich Hip-Hop-Spast platt per Kicks en masse
Und zwar locker aus der Hüfte wie'n Frisbee-Wurf
Ey, neben mir sieht The Rock aus wie 'ne Missgeburt
Du kippst den Whisky pur, doch gleich wirst du Spastiker hart geboxt
Bis deine Rattenvisage Schrott ist wie das Staffelfinale von Lost
Ich hab das Testo da, Bitch, I'm the best so far wie Escobar

Und wegen mir kriegst du bald eine Patrone ab
Ohne Quatsch, ich habe die Gun in der Hand

Meine Feinde sind out und nicht kriminell

Der Fakt ist, dass ich wegen Hustle mit Es und Haschisch-Paketen
Die Cops im Nacken hab, du deine Krawatte, nachdem
Sich nach dem Box dein Kopf um locker 180 Grad dreht
Ey, was wir machen, nachdem wir dein Gebiet betreten
Ist Gewalt anwenden wie Kriegsgemälde
Verpassen dir mit paar gezielten Schlägen schiefe Zähne

Außer umzukippen, nachdem ich dir meinen Kontostand zeige.

Die beste Gangster-Rap-Crew, Boss und Banger Part Two
Yeah, die Jungs geh'n wieder ab wie ein Henna-Tattoo
Sieh uns in Backstagehallen platzen, ratatatata
Und dann mit Westside-Zeichen Fotos zwischen Rapperleichen machen
Teste meine Waffe, indem ich auf Feinde feuer
Rapper dissen mich, doch leben von meinen Steuern
Ohne Freude am Leben
Und sind ständig vor'm Mac, wie Menschen, die mir häufig begegnen
JBG, hart wie Stein, wir schlagen dich zu Brei
Du Schutzgeld zahlender Feigling schickst mir deinen Bodyguard vorbei
Ich werf 'nen Blick auf die schillernde funkelnde Breitling
Und kill in 'ner ungefähr Dreißigstel Millisekunde die billige Tunte per Highkick
Und vor 10 Jahr'n gab es eine Spasten-Crew (Ja?)
Von denen einer eine Maske trug
Und seine Bitch, die wollte im Bett zwar Action
Doch wurd jeden Tag vom Kiffer geleckt wie Blättchen

JBG heißt zuschlagen, bis du kapierst
Reich sein, doch Leben als hätte man nix zu verlier'n
Friss oder stirb, ich brenn alles nieder
Denn Geld, Fame und Benz, das war alles nie da
Banger Musik, Selfmade, Al-Qaida

Was für Feature, heute gibt es riesige Blunts
Gangbang, Schlägerei'n, Cocaina und Schwanz

Eine Woche nach Boateng fickte ich
Whisky, Tequila, Jacky bis Cocaina
Weißt du, ich traf diese Bitch auf 'ner Gala
Keine 2 Stunden, bis mein Dick in ihr'm Arsch war
Guck, ich besuch dich Hippie-Spast und dein WG-Mitbewohner
Eine Bewegung, ihr seid weg wie PC-Bildschirmschoner
Die Punks sind hässlich und paffen Blätter
Ich schieß mit der Tec auf die Pflanzenfresser
Und sorge für Verletzte wie Krankenschwestern
Freitag nachts, du tanzt unter Disko-Kugeln
Doch dann komm ich rein und verteil in der Disko Kugeln
Ich schlag dir deine große Schnauze ein
Ich hab gehört du drehst ein Film, Brokeback Mountain 2
Yeah, ich bin heut der beste hier
Doch ich war schon damals krass Mann
Nur was ich daraus mach, stand
In den Sternen wie'n Star-Wars-Abspann
Heut sagen Leute von damals zu mir
Bruder, guck mal, du hast dich verändert
Ich sage kann sein, aber guckt alle lieber mal an meiner Panzerkette
Das goldene Ahornblatt an

Kölnmusik Big Band,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

No stopping me from getting on top

Somehow she stayed strong I never saw her cry
I was the oldest and responsibility
was so immense, the tension, we'd disagree
So I left cos at the time I felt she hated me
U told me to be strong
Told me 2 hang on hugged me tight

U never stopped holdin' me up never stopped
tryin' 2 open me up
The days n nights I spent stressin'
The years I spent in depression this is my confession
thought bout endin' it sometime
But the second that u crossed my mind
I knew I could never leave u
Made me believe
U set me free

All alone this special day

You took my love for granted
Then you mean to think that
Everything was fine between me and you
Everytime this day comes around
I wanna feel your touch
I can't believe what you did to me
I hate cha, did me wrong
But still I must move on

I gotta move on, ooh oh

But don't know how

We cannot reach that far

Oh, we've tried
At times we've lied

Is something that I was shown
What I'm trying to tell you
Is something that I was told
But it's so hard to see
And it's so hard to feel

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Now where do we begin
It's said we must look within
'Cause love is to be and to be is to love
So reach up, reach high and someday we'll find out what love is

Confuse what I feel with something that's real

We'll do what it takes, we'll find a way

No sign anywhere of a dove
There'll be no reason left to stay
We'll try and live another day
In a place where there's still love

So why don't you come away

Dreh mich um und gehe in den Keller und zähl die Kohle

Ich zähl mein Geld allein im Keller (Keller, Keller, Keller)
Ich bring es nicht einmal zur Bank, ich hab noch nie etwas verliehen
Zähl mein Geld allein im Keller (Keller, Keller, Keller)
Und das Teilen fehlt mir schwer, deshalb sitz ich in mei'm Keller yeah yeah

Kontra K,"Die Decke sinkt, meine Wände werden enger
Wieder mal Zeit was zu verändern
Viel zu lang keine Resultate, aber die Tage werden länger
Und länger schon nichts gemacht worauf man stolz sein kann
Nie angekommen, aber trotzdem immer wieder neu anfangen
Das Handy klingelt, aber scheiß drauf, lass die Mailbox ran
Kapuze tief in meinen Gesicht, kein Bock auf Blickkontakt
Und der Wind ist kühl, die Augen tränen, es läuft mehr schleppend als zu gehen
Druck auf meinen Schultern, die Vergangenheit ist ein schweres Paket
Drückt mich tief in den Morast, warum fuckt mich alles ab?
Und keiner meiner Schritte bringt mich voran, 
Denn ohne den Willen auch keine Kraft
Mit dem Rücken zu Wand, mein Kopf zerplatzt
Das Blut will kochen voller Hass
Der Himmel grau, die Straße nass
Aber der Regen kühlt mich ab

Der Himmel in grau, dunkle Wolken ziehen auf
Ich atme den Regen, ertrage das Leben
Der Himmel in grau, wäscht den Dreck von meiner Haut
Nur an Tagen wie diesen brechen meine Wurzel den Beton wieder auf

Warum tut es heute noch viel mehr weh als sonst
Mir war doch klar aus welcher Richtung der Dolch in meinen Rücken kommt
Rennen fällt schwerer, meine Beine stecken fest im Beton
Jedes einzelne Wort in meinem Kopf klingt nur noch nach traurigen Songs
Die Mauer wächst, der Panzer schließt sich weil zu viel einfach zu viel ist
Dunkelgrau meine Gefühle wie der Himmel an Tagen wie diesen
Der Kragen ist zu eng und jeder Atemzug schwer
Das Stechen in meiner Brust wird von mal zu mal mehr
Ich will nur weg, vergiss den Rest, wieso halbvoll, denn das Glas ist leer
Alle Träume irren nur tot geträumt in diesem Niemandsland umher
Also was will ich hier wo alles verdirbt was man noch hat
Ich könnte explodieren vor Hass, aber der Regen kühlt mich ab

Der Himmel in grau, dunkle Wolken ziehen auf
Ich atme den Regen, ertrage das Leben
Der Himmel in grau, wäscht den Dreck von meiner Haut
Nur an Tagen wie diesen brechen meine Wurzel den Beton wieder auf

Der Himmel in grau
Ich atme den Regen, ertrage das Leben
Der Himmel in grau, wäscht den Dreck von meiner Haut
Nur an Tagen wie diesen brechen meine Wurzel den Beton wieder auf

Zu viele Krisen
Man sieht sich selbst am Boden liegen
Keine Liebe an Tagen wie diesen
Die Wolken brechen auf
Wie die Pflanzen aus dem Boden heraus
Also gib nicht auf auf an Tagen wie diesen

Bevor du handelst, lass dein Blut lieber abkühlen
Lenk dich ab, beiß' deine Zähne fest zusammen
Denk lieber fünf Minuten nach, 
Als wegen nur einer in den Knast gehen

Ich balle meine Faust zusammen, meine Adern wollen explodieren
Kopf voll Widerstand, behalt die Distanz, bleib weg von mir
Denn nur noch ein Wort von dir, alles hier eskaliert
Alleine deine Art und die Weise wie du redest Dicker
Lässt einen seine Kontrolle verlieren
Purer Hass, Dämonen von früher werden wieder wach
Ich gönne jedem seine Sache, aber deine macht mich krank
Ich bin immer ruhig, viel zu lang' hab' ich gefressen
Hab nie gehört, auf dumme Schleimer und die Neider, die mich testen
Einer der Letzten der Bock hat sich zu fetzen
A-a-a-a-aber deine Sorte ist ein Grund, für meinen Hass auf die Menschen
Nackenhaare stellen sich auf, ein Zittern meiner Faust
Und wenn ich dir schon sage dass ich hasse wie du redest, warum hälst du nicht das Maul?
Ich versteh nicht wie du denkst und will nicht hören was du mir sagen willst
Meistens sind dumme Quatscher laut und tiefe Wasser still
Also rede nicht, rede nicht
Bleib einfach still

Und gehst du Knock Out durch 'ne Kombi, brauchst du dich nicht wundern
Wa-Was denkst du wer du bist und auch deinen Rücken kenn ich nicht
Doch geh den allerletzten Schritt und ich breche dein Streichholzgenick
Das Fass ist voll und wenn es überläuft dann auch auf dich
Großer Macker, nur zu dritt, beim 1 on 1 dann blass wie Milch
Also geh deinen Weg still und leise in einem Bogen an mir vorbei
Kein Streit, gebe jedem meine Hand, aber manche gehen einfach zu weit
Grenzen sind da um sie zu wahren und um zu spielen, hab ich keine Zeit
Pack wieder ein, für den Schwanzvergleich sind wir langsam zu alt
Willst du's wissen, kein Problem, kurz in den Ring und boxen lassen
Aber schmiede keine Intrigen wie Fotzen bei 'nem Modelcasting, Dicker

Ich mach deinen butterweichen Charakter zu einer Mauer aus Granit
Zieh den Stock aus deinem Arsch, mach einen Soldat auch noch aus dir

Nur ein Ergebnis motiviert, nicht immer nur der Weg ist schon das Ziel

Stillstand bedeutet Rückschritt, also bleib in Bewegung
Was du gibst, ist was du zurück kriegst und Gott gab dir nur ein Leben

Alles nur Kreide auf Beton, weggewaschen 
Vom nächsten Regen Wenn er kommt alles umsonst,

So wunderschön und falsch ist nur des Teufels kleine Schwester
Hast meinen Panzer geknackt, auch wenn der Schlüssel dafür weg war
Mein Herz kurz berührt, aber seitdem wird es nur kälter
Bricht jeden Tag ein bisschen mehr, mein Inneres bleibt leer

Ich konnte nicht erkennen, was dahinter wirklich ist
Wer du bist, dunkler Schatten, das unendliche Nichts
Und alles versteckt unter deinem vollkommenen Gesicht
So gefühlstot, keine echte Liebe die du gibst
Deine Umarmung ist der Winter und dein Atem kalter Wind
Wo du warst ist alles Eis und wo du bist verwelkt das Leben
Bei Gott kein Engel, aber weinst du gibt es Regen
Ich werde dich vergessen, auch wenn wir uns begegnen
Du warst nur ein böser Traum, der wieder verschwindet so wie Nebel

Nie genug, aber auch nie zu große Ziele
Mach die Luft in deiner Lunge zu Benzin für die Maschine
Den Neid von so vielen zu Öl für das Getriebe
Neuer Tag, neues Glück, neue Regeln, neue Spieler
Hochfliegen heißt fallen in die Tiefe
Doch ohne große Opfer gibt es großen keine Siege
Wir hören kein Nein, kein das geht nicht, kein der Weg ist zu weit
Denn nur mit Blut, Schweiß und Tränen
Bezahlt man die Unendlichkeit
Und noch einen anderen Weg kenn ich keinen

Du musst es wollen, wie deine Lunge die Luft zum Atmen will
Denn Flügel wachsen einem nur, wenn den Mut auch hat und springt
Wenn ich stürze, bleib ich liegen, steh ich härter auf und fliege
Nur wer Angst hat vor dem Fall, muss ein ganzes Leben kriechen
Geh nie auf die Knie, der Blick immer Richtung Sonne
Den Anblick speichern für den Fall, dass es mal länger blitzt und donnert
Auch wenn man einmal verliert, muss man besser zurückkommen als man ging
Der Wille macht das Fleisch auf deinen Knochen zu Beton
Nichts ist umsonst, jeden Zentimeter muss man selber gehen
Denn von alleine wird nichts kommen
Motiviert, der Tunnelblick ans Ziel
Denn wann wenn nicht jetzt und wer wenn nicht wir

Erfolg ist kein Glück

Keine Zeit mehr zu warten, lass die Anderen für mich schlafen
Die immer träumen von Erfolg, doch zieh durch bis er dann da ist
Talent ist harte Arbeit, Perfektion dauert Jahre
Wenn sie schreien ich hab es leicht, dann habt ihr leider keine Ahnung
Wir kommen tief aus dem Dunklen entgegen der Erwartung
Hass und Neid, Blut und Schweiß gibt dem Leben nur mehr Erfahrung
Ausdauer ist der Schlüssel für den Ruhm
Es gibt viel was mir fehlt, aber davon hab ich genug

Meine Art zu denken (immer bereit sein)
Zu atmen, zu leben, zu kämpfen (also bedenke)
Allein der Ehrgeiz überschreitet Grenzen
Disziplin, ein Wille wie Granit tötet alle deine Schwächen
Sport frei

Ein einziger Gedanke wird zur Art, wie man lebt
Und ein Ziel, was noch Traum war, schon bald Realität
Denn nur, wer keinen Bock hat, hat Gründe
Doch wer wirklich will, findet immer einen Weg
Und er geht mit dem Kopf durch Wände
Seinem Herz am rechten Fleck immer bis an's Ende
Denn wirklich große Ziele machen Mensch zur Maschine
Ob du einer von ihnen bist liegt nur in deinen Händen

Meine Art zu denken
Zu atmen, zu leben, zu kämpfen
Allein der Ehrgeiz überschreitet Grenzen
Disziplin, ein Wille wie Granit tötet alle deine Schwächen
Meine Art zu denken (immer bereit sein)
Zu atmen, zu leben, zu kämpfen (also bedenke)

Kontra K,"24.12. In 2013, ihr Herzschlag verlangsamt, 
Je schneller die Zeit geht
Familie zusammen, sie wächst durch meinen Kleinen
Atmet jetzt schwerer und lässt sich fallen
Das Licht kommt näher, der Tunnel wird weiter
Schmerzen verschwinden, Beine werden leichter
Die Stimmung ist heiter, um meinen Nachwuchs zu feiern
Und so bemerkt es fast keiner
Denn ihr Lächeln ist mehr als Zufriedenheit
Weil sie sieht, dass Kind wird voller Liebe sein
Und so lässt sie los, im Kreis ihrer Liebsten
Und schenkt den Rest ihrer Kraft meiner wachsenden Familie

Denn wo einer kommt, lässt ein andrer los
Denn neben dem Leben steht auch immer der Tod
Hinter der Sonne folgt auch immer der Mond
Egal was wir tun, Karma ist groß
Wo einer trauert, spendet auch einer Trost
Und wo einer fällt, kommt ein anderer hoch
Wer Gutes tut, wird auch mit Gutem belohnt
Auch nach dem Tod, Karma ist groß

Nachts auf der Autobahn im Sekundenschlaf
Er träumt vom Leben und denkt über seine Kumpel nach
Über Streit und warum er so unfair war
Dem Leben viel zu undankbar
Also betet er die letzten Sekunden, Zeitlupe
Sein Wagen überschlägt sich mit 100
Nur noch eine gute Tat oder ein Wunder
Als langsam vergessen zu werden nach 'nem Unfall
Und sie wartet ein Jahr auf einen Spender
Doch Räder drehen sich nur, wenn man auch Geld hat
Und das, obwohl sie so ein guter Mensch war
Sogar an den Momenten, wenn das Leben ungerecht war
Sie flüstert ihr Gebet Richtung Sternenhimmel
Möge der Mond ihr einen Engel schicken und er kommt
Ihr neues Herz schlägt mit Kraft
Danke an den Mann aus dem Wrack

Denn wo einer kommt, lässt ein andrer los
Denn neben dem Leben steht auch immer der Tod
Hinter der Sonne folgt auch immer der Mond
Egal was wir tun, Karma ist groß
Wo einer trauert, spendet auch einer Trost
Und wo einer fällt, kommt ein anderer hoch
Wer Gutes tut, wird auch mit Gutem belohnt
Auch nach dem Tod, Karma ist groß

Dicker, wenn es kommt, glaub mir, irgendwann kommt es
Und alles was du warst, steht dann auf deim' Konto
Warst du gestern ein Schwein, bist du morgen dein' Kopf los
Aber warst du ein Engel, steigst du zu Gott hoch
Alles gleicht sich aus
Denn Minus und Minus macht Plus
Und wem zu viel nicht genug ist, hat Frust
Und, Dicker, welchen Weg das Leben mir bereit hält
Es hat einen Grund

Denn wo einer kommt, lässt ein andrer los
Denn neben dem Leben steht auch immer der Tod
Hinter der Sonne folgt auch immer der Mond
Egal was wir tun, Karma ist groß
Wo einer trauert, spendet auch einer Trost
Und wo einer fällt, kommt ein anderer hoch
Wer Gutes tut, wird auch mit Gutem belohnt
Auch nach dem Tod, Karma ist groß",Karma
Kontra K,"Egal wohin du gehst, es ist immer um dich rum
Ob du lebst wie ein König oder festhängst im Sumpf
Die Räder drehen sich schneller wenn es fließt
Jedes Fundament gebaut auf Papier, nicht mal der Tod ist umsonst
Frauen werden leichter, Freunde falscher
Nur du immer reicher, eingesperrt in einem Safe aus Beton
Aus einem Fisch wird ein Hai 
Und ein wunderschöner Vogel wird ein ekliger Geier
Es bestimmt wie sie reden, die Mimik, die Gestik bestimmt dein ganzes Leben
Schenk dir Flügel aus Wachs und das Erste was du machst, 
Fliegst zu nah an die Sonne
Sieh zu wie sie schmelzen und ich sag dem Abgrund Bescheid, dass wir kommen
Wir kommen ihm entgegen

Kommt schwerer als du glaubst
Geht schneller als dir lieb ist
Bringt dich an die Spitze der Welt
Aber leider auch oft in die Tiefe

Es macht, dass du lachst, weinst, absteigst, wach bleibst
Gibt dir das, was du immer schon wolltest, nur keine Gefühle

So lange man es teilt, ist man niemals allein
Doch ist diese Zeit irgendwann mal vorbei, 
Wird sogar dein Blut zu deinem Feind
Es ist nicht mehr wichtig, was du kannst, 
Nicht mehr wer du bist, sondern wie viel du hast
Es macht dich immer kälter und stumpft dich ab
Egal wie viel du frisst, du wirst nicht mehr satt
So paranoid, denn jeder will ran an deinem Bunker
Freundschaft erkauft man mit Hundert, Liebe mit Klunkern
Deine Federn werden rabenschwarz und die Seele immer dunkler
Du siehst nur noch Funkeln in ihren Augen
Doch auch alles Papier dieser Welt macht dich nicht unverwundbar

Kommt schwerer als du glaubst
Geht schneller als dir lieb ist
Bringt dich an die Spitze der Welt

Und droh' zu ertrinken, dann hält es meinen Kopf über Wasser

Sogar der kleinste hält mich auf den Beinen
Und tut es weh, dann heißt es, Zähne zusammenbeißen
Bis das Gröbste vorbei ist
Also leg' ich meinen Kopf in den Schoß des Schicksals
Und setze alles, was ich hab auf unendlich
Meine Glückszahl und hole mir vom Tod mein' Gewinn ab

Denn solang' es noch schlägt
Und ich noch aufrecht steh'
Segel ich auch gegen den Wind
Auf viel zu rauer See
Weil mein Herz mir erzählt, dass immer noch was geht

Und auch wenn es dann wehtut
Ist es okay, dann ist es okay, ist es okay
Weil immer noch was geht, immer noch mehr geht
Wenn ich höre wie es schlägt

Auch im tiefsten Dunkeln wird ein Funken zum Feuer
Aus sinnlosem Hass macht es Freundschaft
Aus Dummheit Verständnis, Momente unendlich
Aus wertlos wird kostbar und teuer
Aus Luftschlössern werden echte Häuser
Aus Pessimisten wieder kindliche Träumer
Es ist viel zu groß um dir nicht zu verzeihen
Denn Wunden heilt die Zeit
Auch wenn man dich furchtbar enttäuscht hat
Es trocknet die Tränen im Wind
Auch wenn mal ein Leben endet wo ein Leben beginnt
Weil das Schicksal die Regeln bestimmt

Kontra K,"Der Boden vibriert und dein Herzschlag auf dem Beat
Ich dreh' dir Filme in deinen Kopf bis du jede Zeile hier fühlst
Mit Haut und Knochen für die Musik
Jeder Atemzug ein Flashback, ob Gangster oder Backpack
Mein Sound ist Heroin, schon wie auf Turkey is er mal nicht da
Gebe dir was du vermisst hast
Ich hab was du brauchst, reiner Stoff, guter Pusher
Was für Crack, ich gebe dir Rap und nach der Hook kommt der Turn
Jeder Teil deines Körpers verbrennt Schwäche, du kriegst Muskeln beim Hören
Pupillen schwarz wie die Nacht, ich kletter da rein und mach dich wach
Und jeder Einzelne Zweifel an dir selbst wird von Grund auf zerstört, ey
Hochmotiviert, für drei Minuten nicht wie sie
Eine Kick, eine Drum, ein Wort direkt ins Blut und du fliegst - siebter Himmel
Ein vollkommener Gewinner
Mach einen Schritt in meine Welt und bleib für immer
Dicker, was brauchst du, alles da, schnipps deinen Joint weg und komm ran
Was fehlt, ist ein wenig von dem Sound den ich hier hab

Genießt den freien Fall in das Licht, in das Licht

Lupenrein ohne Abturn in eine Welt ohne Schwerkraft
Denn alle deine Sinne werden hier nur schärfer als das Grau wo du herkamst
Vollkommen frei wie das Update für Körper und Geist
Mit dem Kopf durch Wände, während du mit deinen Händen die Bäume ausreißt
Und vorbei ist es erst wieder, wenn du das sagst
Mir scheißegal, ob du in der Schule oder nur in U-Haft warst
Ich mach' euch gleich, reich, stark, gleich, schwach, gleich, frei
Ich mach' euch alle gleichmäßig high
Es macht keinen Sinn davon zu rennen, denn es holt dich sowieso ein
Ob du willst oder nicht, du wirst jetzt Teil von etwas Größerem sein
Selbst wenn ich geh', schwebst du noch drei Meter über dem Boden
Und wer was anderes sagt, hat nur gelogen
Keine andere Droge macht dich so breit ohne dich abzubauen
Kommt immer gerne wieder vorbei, wenn ihr dann Nachschub braucht

Kontra K,"Es waren größere Pläne, eine weißere Weste 
Und ein ehrlicheres Lächeln
Es gab viel mehr zu lieben, kein Gedanken galt der Schwäche
Nur Matchbox und Sandkasten-Battles, niemand musste stechen
Was für rappen, Astronaut war noch ein Ziel
Und kein Mensch konnte es stoppen durch den Satz das schaffst du nie
Wir waren so weit weg von Hass, eine andere Galaxie
Ohne Neid, ohne Gier, ohne Job, ohne Beef, ohne Krieg
Ohne Anzug und Kontostand, cool mit dem was Gott uns gab

Und danach wird man verdorben, wie zum Teufel sind wir nur so geworden

Die Kohle scheißegal, viel wichtiger war
Wann ist Papa wieder da und nimmt dich endlich in den Arm
Du hättest jedem die Hand gegeben
Doch heute denkt man dreimal nach über Neid und Verrat
Und in aller erster Linie an den eigenen Arsch
Früher hat man noch geteilt, auch wen man nichts dafür bekam
Und unterm Strich waren wir doch viel glücklicher als jetzt

Verbrennen uns die Flügel, Abgrund wir kommen
Kosten verbotene Früchte und trommeln

Wir malen mit Farben, die sie nicht sehen
Und kommen euch rückwärts entgegen auf dem selben Weg
Wir trinken mehr als wir Durst haben
Schmeißen Gläser an die Wand, aber ackern auch an Sonntagen
Wandeln wie im Koma, doch wach durch die Nacht
Haben keinen Hunger mehr, doch werden niemals satt

Wir wollen lieber kämpfen als diskutieren
Und haben wir ein Problem, dann suchen wir's bei dir
Wir haben zu wenig, aber doch noch zu viel

Enttäuschen zu gerne eure hohe Erwartung
Schon mit zehn Jahren verbrennen sie die Bravo

Heißt es brennende Autos gegen schutzsichere Westen

Aber was wir nicht wollen, das wissen wir am besten

Alles hat ein' Grund, auch warum ich nachts immer wach 
Bleibe, jede Narbe auf der Haut ist ein Abzeichen
Und in der Hitze des Gefechts sind die Tränen von gestern der Schluck
Der mir hilft, dass ich bei Kraft bleibe
Auch ganz allein gegen den Rest der Welt hab' ich immer noch 
Mehr Mut als Verstand
Mein Willen und mein Stolz sind wie Nadel und Faden
Flicken jede Wunde meines Körper nach dem Kampf wieder zusammen
Ich komme runter und überdenke meinen nächsten Zug gut sieben Atemzüge lang

Knochen brechen, aber niemals die Armee meiner Gedanken
Die Soldaten halten stand bis zum allerletzten Mann
Auch wenn keiner mehr an meiner Seite steht, ist okay
Denn ich bin stärker mit dem Rücken zur Wand

Sammel deine Knochen wieder auf, wenn sie brechen
Wische deine Tränen weg und zeig ihn' keine Schwäche

Hat man die Kehrseite der Medaille wirklich mal gesehen
Und willst du austeilen wie 'n Champion
Dann heißt das auch mal die Schläge auf die Deckung zu nehmen
Und lieber kämpf' ich ganz allein als dass ich die Hände falscher Leute um mein' Hals hab'
Die wahre Stärke macht oft einsam, denn es kostet viel mehr Kraft, wenn man mal nein sagt
Auch an einem Scheißtag lass' ich mir die Luft nicht nehmen
Ich bin viel zu weit gekommen, um wieder umzudrehen

Doch was dir bleibt ist was ihn' fehlt
Dein Stolz und keiner in der Welt nimmt ihn dir

Die Feinde auf dei'm Weg und die Last auf deinen Schultern lassen die Muskeln nur wachsen
Gewinnen oder verlieren ist egal, wenn du nur kämpfst
Denn Charakter ist das Resultat aller unserer Schlachten
Auch allein gegen Hunderttausend bleibt langer Atem die richtige Waffe
Denn die Stärke der Schwachen liegt nur in ihrer Masse

Sammel deine Knochen wieder auf, wenn sie brechen
Wische deine Tränen weg und zeig ihn' keine Schwäche

Da ist nur ein Geist, der mich anstarrt im Spiegel
Die versteinerte Mimik begräbt seine Gefühle
Wie ein Fluch, der die zerstört, die ihn lieben
Er schneidet Wunden in sein Fleisch, die zum Heilen zu tief sind
Doch trotz all seiner Fehler muss Gott ihn noch lieben
Denn nur das kann der Grund sein, warum er noch hier ist
Warum jeder Atemzug ihm neue Kraft gibt
Neuen Mut, wenn sein Rücken zur Wand ist
Wenn alle seine Sünden sich auftun
Zu 'ner Mauer zu hoch, um sie leicht zu überwinden
Was bleibt ihm dann außer der Angriff?
Weil seine Seele zerfressen von Angst ist
Er sah so viele kommen und gehen, doch was bleibt, sind die Zweifel
Trauer wird Wut, wenn alle Tränen schon geweint sind
Jede Nacht mit dem Vollmond alleine
Seine Freundschaft ein Schwert mit zwei Schneiden

„Werde bloß nicht wie ich!“

Denn genau das ist, was du nicht erkennst, denn du bist blind

Bist meine einzige Medizin, die mir noch hilft gegen den Ast, der in meinem Bauch ist
Und genau dann, wenn ich dich brauche, die ganze Kraft, die in meiner Faust ist

Und würdest blind für jemanden in den Tod gehen, wenn er dir beweist, er ist dein Freund

Sogar durch Stein auf meiner Brust machst du sein Schlagen wieder hörbar
Keine Wörter, die beschreiben, was du auslöst
In den Menschen, Knochen brechen, aber nie dein' Wille, Schmerz wird ausgeblendet
Jedes Hindernis wird kleiner
Und solange nur ein Funken von dir bleibt, stoppt uns keiner

Weil jeder Fehler mich stark macht, über dem Standard

Blauer Beton wird wieder zu Treibsand und hält dich fest, immer dann, wenn du fliegen willst

Doch irgendwann überrennt euch, was ihr krampfhaft versucht zu kontrollieren
Denn Schafe werden zu Wölfen, durchbeißen ihre Ketten
Ihr habt viel zu lange ungestraft von unsern Tellern mitgefressen
Keine bösen Taten vergessen, ein Gedächtnis wie Elefanten
Alles, was uns im Weg steht, wird zertrampelt

Ihr könnt und verdrängen und mit Kugeln bekämpfen

Es gibt hier nichts mehr umsonst, nicht mal der Tod, wenn er dann endlich kommt
Nichts sehen, nichts sagen, zu viel Angst für bisschen Courage
Mann, ihr lebt nur in einer Blase, doch die Wahrheit ist eine Nadel
Löst ein Luftschloss in Rauch auf, wie die Autos bei Randalen
Auf der Straße fliegen Steine, es wehen keine weißen Fahnen
Der Fernseher hält dich dumm und weg von der Realität
Denn das Blut an all unseren Händen sollen wir doch lieber nicht sehen
Posten nur was fürs Gewissen auf der Pinnwand, schon okay
Doch dein virtuelles Mitleid trocknet keine echten Tränen
Viel zu weit, um umzudrehen, weil die Lunte längst brennt
Und entweder gehst du unter oder kämpfst

Farben verblassen kein Grund, warum ich noch lange bleib'

Mein Herz schlägt nur durch ein' Punkt auf einem Ultraschall
Das ganze Leben vorher wie ein großer Wutanfall
Doch Hass verpufft an einem einzigen Freudenschrei
Albtraum vorbei und ich bin endlich wach
Halt dein' Kopf in meiner Hand und hab' das erste Mal wirklich Angst
Doch auch neue Kraft
Denn ich lass' sicher kein Problem dieser ungerechten Welt auch nur ein' Zentimeter zu nah an dich ran
Solange du das selber noch nicht kannst, fang' ich alles für dich ab

Gott gab mir ein Geschenk, denn in dein' Adern fließt mein Blut
Ich werde da sein und dich auffangen, wenn du fällst
Muss es sein, dann wir beide ganz allein gegen den Rest der Welt
Du wirst Fehler machen, doch auf sicher nie meine
Aber auch an deinem Weg liegen Steine
Solange das Schicksal mich liebt und ich dich begleite
Räum' ich jeden davon für dich beiseite
Nur du konntest mein Herz heilen
Doch fängst du an, zu weinen, bricht es schnell wieder in eintausend Teile
Ein Gedanke an dich zieht mich raus aus jeder Scheiße
Nur weil es dich gibt, bin ich zum Glück nicht mehr der Alte
Es fehlte nur ein Schritt in das ewige Nichts
Doch bevor es zu spät war, bekamen wir dich

Endlich bin ich da

Jeder will was, jeder hat was oder braucht was von dir
Oben dran kam das Finanzamt und klaut was von mir
Wenn man immer ackert und der Kopf raucht wegen Abfuck von den andern
Dann platzt man irgendwann bei jemandem, der nichts kann dafür
Denn das Ticken aller Zeiger bohrt sich tief in den Kopf rein
Die Paranoia machen, dass einem nicht mehr nur ein Wort reicht
Doch ist verständlich, wenn die Schatten der Vergangenheit
Dir beibringen: Jeder sucht nur sein' Vorteil!
Wenn einem alles mal zu viel, man nicht mehr redet, sondern schreit
Nimm dir Zeit für dich allein und lass dich fallen

Ich wollte sie so gerne bei mir behalten, doch sie waren rastlos, so wie der Wind
Keinen der Tage vergessen, an den' wir geflogen oder gefallen sind
Zusammen gelitten bei Stress in der Gosse oder zu high und gelacht wie ein Kind
Hoffnung, der Rest hat dann immer zusammengehalten wie Pech und Schwefel
So wie Soldaten im Krieg eine Einheit, doch heute gehen wir andere Wege
Die erste Zigarette, das erste Mal draußen Schläge
Mitternacht - kriminelle Action, dann auf der Wache zum Blut entnehmen
Von Neukölln bis Halle gelauf'n, die Bahn verpasst, aber nur um zu reden
Dabei eine Lunte geraucht, gesagt, wir hören auf, während wir schon den nächsten drehen
Majoran, Ku'damm, Touris blenden, Ticker überfallen
Tausende von unterirdischen Songs aufnehmen, Hauptsache, der Beat ist geil
Ich weiß noch genau, wo ich herkomm' und jeder von euch ist ein Teil
Von alledem, was ich nun bin, ob vergangen oder noch dabei
Ich bin nicht weg, nur gefangen in der Zeit

Jeden Tag nur von der Hand im Mund, der Hunger so groß und mit wenig zufrieden
Keinen Cent für ein Block Papier, die Zeilen geballert auf gelbe Briefe
Immer so tief in der Krise, die Konten im Minus, doch trotzdem
Liebe, vor allem die Leute, die an meiner Seite gestanden haben wie Brüder
Für die, deren Mütter so oft für mich kochten, denn sie wussten, ich habe nichts im Kühlschrank
Oder die Tage am Mikro, an denen die Clique uns wichtiger war als die Features
Vergesse niemals, auch wenn man mich fragt nach ei’m anderen Weg, den ich wählen kann
Würde ich wieder den exakt selben gehen wie früher
Dieselben Fehler machen, dieselben Herzattacken
Bekommen, wenn Bullen vorbeifahren, nur weil man zu dumm und zu high war
Dass man vergessen könnt', dass man im Kofferraum circa ein Jahr Knast dabei hat
Lieber Gott, lass uns noch einmal so frei sein
So wie wir damals waren, der erste Jackpot im Park
Das erste Mal Adrenalin im Blut, während die Jungs einen Wholecar malen

Statt der Großstadtromantik der Boden voller Dreck
Auch im Sommer ist die Luft hier kälter als man denkt
Denn jeder hat einen Rücken, aber keiner mehr Respekt
Wie ein scheiß Western, nur die Kugeln sind so echt
Wie die Tränen in den Kissen bei unsern Müttern im Bett
Sag mir, werd' ich alt oder packt es mich erst jetzt?
Warum gehen wir nicht zusammen, sondern ballern uns nur weg?
Ich denk' mich in den Himmel, doch hör die Vögel nicht zwitschern
Und statt unser Herz hören wir nur den Teufel flüstern
Paranoia macht ein'n schlagartig nüchtern
Wir beten vor dem Schlafen, doch schalten nochmal das Licht an
Jeder schreibt sein Schicksal
Also warum gehen wir klauen statt zu ackern in 'nem Job, der auch was fit macht?
Trauer schreibt Wut auf zu viele Gesichter
Das Ego ist zu groß und die Empathie nicht da
Ein Wort wird ein Schlag, ein Schlag wird ein Stich
Ein Stich wird ein Finger am Abzug, der ihn auch drückt
Mann, der Tod wird zu Trauer, Trauer wird zu Hass
Hass wird zu Rache, die einer Mutter ihr Kind nahm
Sinnlos, wir füttern nur das Feuer mit Benzin
Gehen Richtung Hölle, aber träum'n vom Paradies
Wollen Frieden im Tod, aber leben einen Krieg
Beten für Hilfe, doch der Teufel sind wir

Er sieht Menschen, die hier sterben, doch darf niemals was verraten (pscht)
Ich hol' die Kohle ran, guck, ich muss nach oben, Mann
Wie ein Berg, den ich bezwing' und die Fahne in den Boden ramm'
Es ist kalt, doch es liegt nicht am Winter
Und auf dem Spielplatz spiel'n keine Kinder
Grausame Welt, Hauptsache, Geld
Hauptsache, keine Aussage fällt
Und mein Herr, wenn wir uns selbst betrügen
Selbst belügen, um mehr zu fühlen
Nichts mehr genügt, wir sind schwer zu führen
Weil wir den Schmerz nicht fühlen, unser Herz ist kühl

Den meisten fehlt Anstand
Zeigen nie das wahre Gesicht, weil sie Angst hab'n
Ich wahre mein Gesicht
Sitz' mit falschen Leuten niemals an einem Tisch
Es ist alles, wie es ist
Schnelles Geld auf der Straße, alles ist Profit
Und ich mach' den nächsten Schritt
Handel' nicht mehr mit Gift, hab' mich wieder im Griff
Und ich mach' den zweiten Schritt
Nie wieder Zelle, der Anwalt bekommt nichts
Und ich bleibe wie ich bin
Immer kühl zu den Leuten, weil ich weiß, wie sie sind
Folge meinem Instinkt (meinem Instinkt)
Bleiben stabil, keiner bleibt liegen

Keine Liebe, die wir geben, im Leben prasseln die Schläge
Auf dich ein wie der Regen, durch den wir gehen
Alle meine Muskeln angespannt, verkrampft, eine Wand, die mit keinem redet
Denn dahinter kämpfen zwei Seelen ums nackte Überleben
Eine will Stille, die andere Sturm, eine Hand reißt ein, was die andere aufbaut

Flieg' hoch in den Himmel, aber fall' dann hart auf den Boden der Realität
Träume los von Erfolgen unter einem Jahr, aber steh' mir nur selbst im Weg
Drei Schritte vor, wieder zwei zurück, doch hält mich nicht ab davon weiterzugehen
Erst mach' ich mich groß und dann red' ich mich klein, Mann, diese Welt macht schizophren
Doch ich werde stärker, meine Haut härter mit jeden Meter, den wir gehen
Und flüster' den Geistern, die ich rief, in Richtung Wolken mein Gebet
Doch ich komm' klar, kein Problem

Was für'n Leben auf der Straße?
Kein Happy-End wie Hollywood

Der Pott ist voll und alle pokern hoch
Denn ein gutes Leben braucht Bares
Doch Glück ist wie ein Luftballon

Rückgrad kann man sich nicht kaufen
Gott sei dank ist nicht jeder so wie du
Nicht jeder so wie du
Ist nicht jeder so wie du
Nicht jeder so wie du

Deine Lügen sind nur trauriger Ersatz für die Wahrheit
Sag mir lieber du kommst niemals
Als zu sagen du wirst da sein (du wirst nicht da sein)
Denn mein Blick durchbricht ihre Masken im Gesicht
Nimm den Weg, den du kamst wieder zurück
Werde nie so sein wie du (wie du)
Werde nie so sein wie du (wie du, wie du)

Werde nie so sein wie du

Und jedes Lüftchen, das du Gegenwind nennst, meinen Kampfgeist motiviert

I looked around she caught my eye 
Walked into the room I couldn't hardly see 
There she was moving closer to me 
She told me her name before I could speak 
Took my hand and then she said these words to me 

Tonight, oh 
This is the night you'll see the light 
That's what she said me 
Tonight, oh 
This is the night you'll see the light

Show me the way show me the light

 I sometimes miss the mark

 But I'd give my life tonight

[Incomprehensible] saw a light and she promised her child
To carry him through and give birth on that side
In a dingy hotel on the north of the line
She gave birth to a boy and went into the lie

To a place on the map we are dying to find
There’s a bill on the books from the ancestor’s law

No child of his will live south of the line

That a promise was written and sealed in her core

Oh, look around and life just ain’t the same

When you think what’s the use

But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything’s gonna change

Would the grass have been greener time and again
‘Coz your circumstance keeps bringing you down

With each new day one thing will stay the same

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same

This one thing that makes one change

Sad to listen to words they had to say
They saw humanity go astray

These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Maybe your body only knows pain
Maybe your hearts’ been broken again
Lost your job in buyin' necessities
Inside you’re screamin', “I got to be free”

You know there’s a power
That lifts us high and higher
Deep in your heart, down in your soul
Have a little faith and then let it flow

Gotta have a little faith livin’ in the 21

Gotta keep the faith, you can’t give in
Gotta run this race and gotta try to win
Gotta hold your head up and smile again
Thank God for all your family and friends

And when it gets rough and when it gets tough
Hold your head up, you gotta try to find the love
Can’t take the pain that this world brings
Sometimes you feel like you wanna scream

Step fast, now move on, you gotta pray
When time get hard, you can’t stray away
Stay focused, you gotta try to reach your goal
Many troubles and trials gonna be down that road

Listen to the signs, gotta keep a clear mind
Livin’ in the 21, you stay on your grind
Hold tight ‘coz you know this world gon' spin
But you come out on top, you know you will win

Girl, you know you’ve always been the strength of me
Got my back when I’m down
Keep my head off the ground

Never messed around, didn't never change
Kept my love when I was going through some things
Now the years have gone by and I’m sure
‘Coz you're still right here, now I know

I was made for love
You were made for me
We were made for us
You’re the only one I need

‘Coz I was made to love you

I’m the only one you need ‘coz I need you

Can I take time out to express myself?
I don’t wanna be with no one else, no
Does it matter what you cannot do?
‘Coz if I got it, girl, you know you got it too

You can rest assure, you got my support
If you really hurting, lean on me, I’ll lift you up
It’s whatchu done for me, is how I feel
I would give my life and then [Incomprehensible]

Kool & the Gang,"Gideon and his baby brother
Caught up in some wild course fire
Tossed a peaceful cradle
September war had come to call

And Gideon carried his baby brother
Checked a thousand miles or more
Faced the hungry lions, angry guns were crying
Handful of containment gone
And I believe, I believe

I believe in miracles
Believers don’t ask why
Child is made from miracles
And there’s a reason why
I believe

Three thousand little boys were [Incomprehensible]
A miracle that they survived
Ancestors, they kept them, mother don’t forget the
Weak that had to march or die

Today the weary cry for mercy
Tomorrow’s wars already come
The healing of the lands held in tiny hands
And comes the earth with each new child
And I believe, I believe

I believe in miracles
Believers don’t ask why
Child is made from miracles
And there’s a reason why

Now miracles, they live among us
We see their faces everyday
When brothers smile from pain, mothers tears refrain
The miracle of hope survives
And I believe, I believe

I believe in miracles
Believers don’t ask why
Child is made from miracles
And there’s a reason why

Unlikely pair to ever fall in love
She has good education, strong determination
I learned my lessons on the road

I watch her as she’s sleeping, kiss her gently seeing
Her smile, then she falls back to her dreams
Guess I’ll walk to the bakery, buy her favorite pastry
You know the woman treats me well

I’ve had other relations, love situations
They ended inside out, upside down
I’ve cried tears when lonely, no one to hold me
Hey love, can you hear me call?

You know love, I’m so proud
Whatever you want is yours ‘coz girl you’ve got my heart
When it was rain outside you sheltered me from the storm
Hello God above, thank you for true love

Make the people merrier, vicious like a terrier 
Like a terrorist, I will terrorize 
Telling any territory I'm a glory enterprise

Brotherman from the motherland, rappers automatic 
Ly suffer as I suffocate, then I start to alienate 
Make you an inmate, so you cannot retaliate

To the climax and those who sleep will have a wet dream 
So don't even quote what you write is dolt

More cooler than an Ice Ages 
Biters, let the effective students walk through my white pages 
Different stages of rage that I'm going through 
And like an owl, you'll know who to 

Feed your greed, you want and need 
The rhymes that you carefully read, but your eyes bleed 
'Cause my fury is scary 
And if you bite, you'll be leaving all your teeth for the Tooth Fairy 
 
Go ahead and dare me, if you think I'm joking or playing 
When you're feeling what I'm saying, you'll be kneeling and praying 
Then I release steam like a radiator

Kool G Rap,"Deadly rhymes, here's the solution
Smoking so bad, I'mma cause a pollution
With satisfaction, bad assassin, fatal attraction
Drop you to an improper fraction
Ill insanity, kill like Amity-
Ville horror, as I wipe out humanity
Won't leave a path, a track, a trail to trace
But when you're staring inside a mirror, you see my face
And I'll terrify, so don't ever try
To shake or bake or flake cause I never fry
Letters together sly as a fox clever than ever
Silly ducks write rhymes with feathers
Really no needles are needed to inject this
Dope cause I'm a death wish, not even Bob Hope's
Rhymes are rugged, soul flooded, cold blooded
You ain't better, you're butter, so just shut it
Here to perform, having a brainstorm, make a rain form
Hot rap groups run to keep the name warm
Putting heads to beddy-bye like Freddy so get ready
Cause I'mma get crazier than Crazy Eddie
I'm alone but my tone is a sharp tune
Developing pictures in your brain like a darkroom
Rappers are captured and tortured with rapture
In 3-D is a G coming at you
Words in my rap will surprise you like Cracker Jacks
You dig them like Sugar Smacks and bite them like Apple Jacks
Brother, sister, misses or mister
My style is complicated, patterns like a twister
FOES, my shadow grows when I walk slow
Nerds are scared to be heard so they talk low
But I've been urging to drill in your brain like a surgeon
Rhymes so dope and they're busting you up like a virgin
More competitors change to challenger
You need to talk into a mic with a silencer
My defeat is like a mission impossible
My brain is unexplained, not illogical
Therefore I'm passing bait to assassinate
Busting your ass so fast, it'll fascinate
You try to duplicate to get up to date
Can't wait to be my pen pal or paper mate
The innovator with greater data, deeper than a crater
Of course, Polo's the boss of the crossfader
The rage is on, my rhymes are airborne
Stage is torn to wreck, my murdering gear's on
Moving a head, never bled inside a bloodshed
Nothing is said, instead heads are dead
G Rap manages styles, taking all the advantages
Putting sucker rappers in bandages
I got a plot so hot it'll tan
I might be cool but I'm far from a fan
Letting you know how it is in show biz
Give me a quiz and I'mma a show you a G wiz
Bright as Einstein, brighter than sunshine
Rhymes will intoxicate like moonshine
Total disaster the broadcaster master
Passed ya as the tempo goes faster
Sparks shoot out from the mic when I rhyme ignites
All types of words I write, put in flight
Rappers evaporate to vapor
I drop science on paper and then build a skyscraper
When I die, scientists will preserve my brain
Donate it to science to answer the unexplained
But as long as I inhale and exhale
I challenge the next female or the next male
What you hear in your ears all appears to be clear
Consider me fair cause I share ideas
That sticks to the mix, more tricks than a 666
So you better grab a crucifix

Men at work

My ideas overload
And the records I make explode in every zip code
Definitely def, the five fingers of death
Doc the Butcher, Polo's the chef
And I'm the waiter cause I serve imitators
Who try to duplicate like an emulator
Try to get paid copying a name brand
If I was Gucci, then you would be Dapper Dan
Now hear the diaper, cause I'm a sniper
You want to get hyper?
Prepare for hyperspace and just flow with the bass
And fall in place, just keep up the pace no time to waste
Just enter the place to see the entertainer
My rhymes keep me fresh like a container
Some rappers said, my rap is dead
Shake your head to my bass like a basehead
There'll be bloodshed in the meat shop
Those who beef get sliced into pork chops
Until your fork stops stabbing my rhymes
From the latest and the greatest of all times
Sleep while you knock Z's, I'mma clock G's
Freeze rap heroes below zero degrees
Rhymes like these will seize enemies
That want to be G, like the Bee Gees
Not rated PG, we break necks
Like sex, rated XXX
Yes, Doc Da Butcher is who I recommend
DJ Polo let the record spin

Construction put on paper
Listen cause I'm building a skyscraper
For a strong foundation of wheels of steel
Not a reel to reel, but the real deal
Polo works the crossfader, he's a bricklayer
And the record player turns like the Himalaya
Doc the Butcher supplies the cement
And the rhymes that I invent is the blueprint
While I'm using my mind to make a design
Polo puts up the Men at Work sign
Yeah, we still building, making a skeleton
One of the sucker MC's just fell again
So take caution if you want to know the truth
I'mma elevate you up to the roof
Listen to the sound, don't dare look down
Cause you're far from the ground
Now you're impressed cause words I manifest
Takes you more higher than cess or Buddha bless
Hard as concrete, the building's complete
Yo Marley Marl, let's stop the breakbeat",Men at Work
Kool G Rap,"cool G Rap and Polo 
Back again 
What? 
This is poison so be alert and cautious 

Those who act courageous you will get nauseous 
Infected or contaminated 
Turn on your stereo never come radio activated 
Deadly and fatal poison the title 

My recital hits the parts that are vital 
So tune in the tone of beats and poems 
Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones 
Pull out your Q tips clean out the earwax 

If you're still hard of hearing, I'mma scrub them with Ajax 
With maximum drum so behave and remember 
You're a slave to my sound wave 
Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find 

A new method time after time 
Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen 
Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then 
Put it on paper cause I make you hyper 

Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper 
Like cherries or some say berries 
Mandatory for the auditory and its glory 
Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me 

G speaks in a new technique of fury 
Domination of drums and noise and 
Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison 

Poison! [Repeat: x3] 
Look-alikes on the mic you should get off 
You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get rid of, cause you bit off 
Bite off ate off imitate off 
They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off 
Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup 
Male or female shut them up, Po shut her up 
 
Yeah hide my line as you pick them up 
Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as well have said stick them up 
Letters of metaphor matters to better the fatter your pocket 
Rhymes blast off like rockets 

Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased 
In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass 
Made in a minute the sky is the limit 
For reaching the goal and the dream wouldn't you want to be in it to win it? 

Biters are wanted like animals hunted 
Soon as I get them I hit them I done it to the suckers who fronted 
The rappers who made it and did it 
Forget about winning the battle cause I'mma shake rattle and roll 

A little something for girls and boys and 
Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison 

A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time 
One step beyond and not behind the line 
That separates dogs from divine 
Take it as a caution, or a warning sign 

Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them 
Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's 
With Polo and while he's slicing 
I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson 

My brain is like a factory constantly creating 
Material stitch by stitch for decoration 
Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining 
My passion in rhyming is fashion designing 

Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it 
You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it 
Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show 
And my brain glows just like a rainbow 

Rappers and poets they already know it 
G Rap is a terror not a error and never will I stop reaching for better 
Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel 
G Rap will make you feel the real deal 

I usually rap hardcore and I know 
That why'all thinking am I somehow semi, so 
We yell ""party"" and girls and boys and 
Remember cool G Rap, Doc the Butcher and Polo is poison",Poison [Hip Hop Version][Mix]
Kool G Rap,"Here I am, R-A-W 
Terrorist, here to bring trouble to 
Phoney emcees, I move on and seize 
I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease 
Cause I'm at my apex and others are be-low 
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo 
Second to none, making emcees run 
So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one 
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol 
And they know it, so I don't see why you all 
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt 
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt 
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi 
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me 
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem 
Cold rock a party, until the A.M. 
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle 
While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme 
With authority, superiority 
And captivate the whole crowd's majority 
The rhymes I use definitely amuse 
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues 
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw 
'Cause I get raw! 

I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin' 
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten 
Or eaten, or just tookin' out 
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out 
And real nervous, when I'm at your service 
So give me that title boy, you don't deserve this 
I work like a slave to become a master 
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta 
Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed 
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it 
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya 
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb 
So full of action, my name should be a verb 
My voice will float, on every note 
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote 
The minute that the Kane starts to go on 
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on 
As I put other rappers out of their misery 
Get em in a battle and make them all history 
Rulin' and schoolin', emcees that I'm duelin' 
Watch em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin' 
On a throne, with a bronze microphone 
Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own 
'Cause I get raw!  

Chillin', killin' like a villain 
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing 
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never 
And the rhymes I bust, comin' off is a must 
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd 
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred 
Never smokin' or hittin' or takin' a sniff 
Only crushin' emcees that be tryin' to riff 
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic 
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic 
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive 
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected? 
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior 
Rather like a samurai, and I'll be damn if I 
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang 
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang 
So if we battle on the microphone 
Bring your own casket and tombstone 
And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world 
Could ever come with more, I get raw!",Raw [#]
Kool G Rap,"Bass, snare drum in your eardrum
Musical outcome, lyrical tantrum
Energy enters me, power absorbed
Phonograph arts and crafts mic warlord
Kool G Rap the lyric dictator
DJ Polo the fader operator
Will crush, squash, rhymes are harsh
All spectators will be brainwashed
Sons, daughters, paper reporters
Receive my command and follow our orders
Poetry slavery biters observe
This is hip-hop your optical nerve
Deserves no need to explain
Plain simple, created by the temple, the brain
Maintain order with pain, well
Only a lamebrain will be expelled
Big boss, swift with force
And of course, you'll be driven off-course
Banded, musically blended
Complete the beat and end it, splendid

Put you in a (trance)
With the rhymes that I (express)
Yo I'mma put you in a (trance)
With the rhymes that I (express)

Words I chant my competitors can't
Physical structure is of a power plant
Mic master interpretating faster
Than any perpetrating fraud broadcaster
I display and MC's pray
Cause under x-ray they are Parkay
And artificial down to their initial
In no position to be official
In hip-hop not the surface or the median
I'm at the top you're a clown and a comedian
A big waste of wax plus tax
Your royalties couldn't buy a can of Ajax
Not energetic rhymes are pathetic
My beat is so sweet you'll become a diabetic
Fascinating revolving and rotating
That's how the record starts motivating

Vocally discharging lyrics like magic
Poetical recital is vital and tragic
Strikes are fatal on the mic I label
Me Kool G Rap and Polo on the table
Violators and intruders
I'll exile barbarian style like an executor
Then muta-late later
Copycatters I batter, G Rap impersonators
Brains scatter my rhyme is the solution
Record rotation forms a revolution
The spin extends another plate blends and
It corresponds to the message I've sent
Even destroy boys with a safety pen
Men who try to dis I discipline
Then I'll diminish, cities I conquer
If I'm a toy boy, I'm tough as Tonka
Visualize me on your MTV
These rhymes I design is called poetry",Rhymes I Express
Kool G Rap,"Love is pain left out in the rain
With nothing to gain but teardrop stains
Being haunted by a memory as I think back
The things we used to do and how we used to act
With love and trust, passion and plussed
Because a pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
Between us, never argued about
And I never gave a clue for you to figure it out
How I miss being blessed with your sweet finesse
As we kiss and twist and caress on the mattress
Sweet body heat, your heartbeat
I'll grip your hips and both of our lips will meet so neat
Staring up at the moonlight with someone to hold tight
Given a chance for romance until the sunlight
Brightens the sky, it reflects in your eye
But now, the reflection is gone and I cry out

She loves me, she loves me not

Looking at your picture as it sits on the table
As I put on my cable I wish that I was able
To touch but it's a shame that you had to go
So I watch the hands on the clock go real slow
Gone with the wind, is love a sin?
If it is then God, then bring it back again
Not a girl that you rate as a fine blind date
I need a love mate so I can create
So I open a window to feel the wind blow
Try to figure out how can a love end so
Fast and just pass and not even last
First grow like grass, then shatter like glass
Now I stare at the walls, clock five Tylenols
Unplug the telephone to avoid phone calls
As I sit and crave for the love she gave
But when I wake up, I'm the same love slave
Saying

She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me

When you lost a good friend, dreams seem to end
Cause broken hearts and men don't blend
So I'm not here to stick every chick I can pick
You move too quick, you become seasick
And a one-night stand is for the one-track mind man
The kind of guy you kick like a can
So I race in space and try to replace the pretty face
But it's a waste, this chase is a kiddy case
Now I whisper how much I missed her
My lips should have blistered the way I kissed her
So soft and slow, laid back and relaxed
And when I move, the groove is as smooth as a sax
She kissed me low and then proceeded up
Bedsheets heated up, the pace is speeded up
Slowly but surely we reach our destiny
She got the best of me and left the rest of me
Now all I got is total confusion
She disappeared and it's not an illusion
My life is bitter, the memories glitter
I feel like dirt, so please do not litter
My heart's deflated, doctors can't rate it
I don't know how the hell I made it
So farewell sweetheart wherever you are
I'll just look at a star, and say yo

She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me","She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not"
