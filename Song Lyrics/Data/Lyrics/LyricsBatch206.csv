Johnny Paycheck,"A one, two, three, four

Busted in Austin 
Walkin' around in a daze
I'm sittin' in a slammer 
Lookin' out through these bars in a haze
But it'll all clear up 
11 months and 29 days

Keep the Lone Star cold 
The dance floor hot while I'm gone
Keep the Lone Star cold 
The dance floor hot while I'm gone, hey now
Keep your hands off my woman 
I ain't gonna be gone that long

Let me hear that harmonica over there, here it comes
A little steel guitar here
Yeah
All right, play it on that fiddle boy

That old judge put a sledgehammer in my hand when he said
I'm gonna send you to Huntsville 
Shave your face and your head
I'm doin' 11/29 boys 
With a cement floor for my bed

Busted in Austin walkin' around in a daze 
Yes, I was
Now I'm sittin' in a slammer 
Lookin' out the bars through a haze
But it'll all clear up 
11 months and 29 days 
Hey Lord",11 Months and 29 Days [Live]
Johnny Paycheck,"You brushed by me, oh, you came so near 
That I could smell the perfume in your hair 
An old memory, it took me back in time 
And my heart stood still for just one minute there 

For a minute there I forgot where I was 
Remembering only when you used to care 
And as you walked by me I almost touched your arm 
I nearly called your name for a minute there 

The man beside you, he looked so satisfied 
Knowing that's his wedding ring you wear 
It cost him nothing for a lifetime in your arms 
But I'd give all I own for just one minute there 
Yes, I'd give all I own for just one minute there",For a Minute There [Live]
Johnny Paycheck,"Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
My woman done left and

'Cause I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more.

I been workin' in this factory
For nigh on fifteen years
All this time I watched my woman
Drownin' in a sea of tears
And I seen a lot of good folks die
That had a lot of bills to pay
I'd give the shirt right offa' my back
If I had the nerve to say.

That foreman, he's a regular dog
The line boss, he's a fool.

Man, he thinks he's cool
One of these days I'm gonna' blow my top
And that sucker, he's gonna' pay
And I just can't seem to wait
Till I get the nerve to say

Johnny Paycheck,"Oh I sat here on this stool drank so much I blew my cool
And now they're closing up a world I'm living in
So I guess it's time to go or at least they told me so
Yes I'm going home it's motel time again

Motel time again yes I take myself to bed
I don't even know what town I'm in
Yet I'll find my way once more to that old number on the door
Then I'll be at home it's motel time again

Yes it’s motel time again yes I take myself to bed

Then I'll be at home it's motel time again",Motel Time Again
Johnny Paycheck,"Pardon me if I seem a little different
But I'm a walking with my head up in the clouds
I'm in love so sadness keep your distance
I'm looking at the happy side of town
I feel good now that things are like they should be
I'm happy as I always knew I would be
Somebody loves me somebody loves me somebody loves me
There's no words to describe the situation
For who could write this feeling in my heart
This is love nothing like infatuation
There's a way to tell the two of them apart
Now that love has become my greatest treasure
Everyday my life is filled with pleasure
Somebody loves me somebody loves me somebody loves me",Somebody Loves Me
Johnny Paycheck,"When she needs someone to love her in the night

Johnny Paycheck,"I couldn't keep my mind on all the work I had to do today
Your memories kept on clouding up my mind getting in my way
Next they'll up and fire me and I'll be wondering what I'm gonna do
The only thing that I can say that makes me act and feel this way is
I never no I never got over you

I still see your dark eyes
Almost everywhere I turn
I keep standing on the bridges
I thought I had burned
I can still feel you near me
In everything I try to do
And the only thing that I can say that makes me act and feel this way is
I never lord I never got over you

old memories have the damndest way of showing up at the most unusual time
They can walk right through the darkest part of your mind and turn on every light
Or take a perfect crystal day and turn it into a misty shade of blue
And the only thing that I can say that makes me act and feel this way is
I never never got over you

I still see your dark eyes
Almost everywhere I turn
I keep standing on the bridges
I thought I had burned

I can still feel you near me
In everything I try to do

Johnny Paycheck,"You always find the way to hurt my pride 
If I'm not crying you're not satisfied
And I don't know why you want to hurt me so
If you're tryin' to break my heart 
You don't have very far to go
You don't have very far to go 
Before the heartache begins
I already feel the sadness 
Of a heartbreak settin' in
I don't know why you want to hurt me so
If you're tryin' to break my heart 
You don't have very far to go

You don't have very far to go

Johnny Paycheck,"Thank you, here's a little song we wrote a while back
Called The Cocaine Train

Well when I was a young lad 
Damned if I didn't know it all
When I was young like you 
Lord I knew it all
But if ya listen to an old dog bark
You might see them holes before you fall

I'm gonna lay somethin' on it and then I'm gonna ease on out
I'm gonna lay somethin' on it and then I'm gonna ease on out
And you can take it or leave it
But I damn well know what I'm talkin' bout

Yeah 'cause I've done and felt the pain
And I've been caught in the damned ol' rain
Lord it's hard to get off
The old white train
Well the old white train costs a lot to ride
Stole your heart, and even your pride
It'll damn sure forever more, honey
Freeze your brain
Well, take a little advice
Stay away from the cocaine train
Hook it now

Yeah 'cause I've done and felt the pain
And I've been caught in the damned ol' rain
Lord, it's hard to get off
The old white train
Well the old white train, it costs a lot to ride
It stole your heart and even your pride
It'll damn sure forever more honey
Freeze your brain
Take a little advice
Stay away from the cocaine train

Stay away from the cocaine train
Cocaine train

Alright",(Stay Away from) The Cocaine Train [Live]
Johnny Paycheck,"I delievered the orders from your last Stanley Party
Though I got some strange looks at the doors
And I cancelled our subscription to the Ladies Home Journal
And told Avon not to call anymore

Men have no need for magazines they don't read
For perfume and powder and such
Me and the house and everything in it
Have lost the feminine touch

The clock by our bed just gave up and stopped ticking
And the flowers on the mantel have died
The dust is gettin' deep on everything but the ceiling
And I've lost all my home owner's pride

Bottles are made from the bar to the bedroom
I've turned to such things for a crutch
Me and the house and everything in it
Have lost the feminine touch
Girl I sure miss your feminine touch",The Feminine Touch
Johnny Paycheck,"I can't take your hurt and wish it away 
Or condemn a love you knew yesterday
I can't be the past you want to relive
My part of forever is all I can give

I can't be a part of some other time
Or free the memories that's chained to your mind
I can't take his dreams and make them live 
My part of forever is all I can give

All I can give is the love you see 
It's all that I have that belongs to me

I was not the cause of yesterday's rain
I never said the words that brought on the pain
The life you had with him is not mine to live 
My part of forever is all I can give
My part of forever is all I can give",My Part of Forever
Johnny Paycheck,"The subject of this next song
Well, I guess it's been around forever
It deals with someone that's so much in love
He's blind to the truth
I think Merle wrote a classic line in this one
""Being a fool is one thing
But not knowing you're a fool is another thing""

Today a friend got through to me
I've been blind I couldn't see
'Cause my love was always standing in the way
Well I've been crazy, I've been blown
My good friends, they knew all along
Yesterday's news just hit home today

Well I've tried
Lord, and I've tried to stay on top of things
Never dreaming such a storm was on it's way
When you owned up to all those lies
I was the only one there that was surprised
Yesterday's news just hit home today

Well I guess the shock of learning that you've been a fool
Allows paranoia and insecurities to creep in
And I'll tell you it underminded our love honey
I thought would never end
You know being a fool is one thing
But not knowing you're a fool, honey, that's another thing
Yesterday's news just hit home today

Well I've tried and I've tried to stay on top of things
Never dreaming such a storm was on it's way
But when you owned up to all those lies
Honey, I was the only fool there that was surprised

Johnny Paycheck,"You ask me to give up a hand of the girl I love
You tell me I'm not the man she's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love 
Oh that's up to her yes and the Lord above
You better move on

Well I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings
But I believe she's happy with me without those things
Still you beg me to set her free 
But my friend that will never be
You better move on

I can't blame you for loving her 
But can't you understand she's my girl
Oh but I'm, I'm never ever gonna let her go 
Yeah, but don't you know I love that woman so

I think you'd better go now I'm gettin' mighty mad
Yeah, but you'd ask me to give up the only love I've ever had
Maybe I would oh but I love her so I'm never gonna let her go

Johnny Paycheck,"Can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left 'em
But at least your lips caressed them while you packed
Or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me

What a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny I don't even care
As you turn to walk away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I have to say
It's been a good year for the roses

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say we haven't said
While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind
I find I haven't said a word
From the bedroom the familiar sound of one baby's cryin' goes unheard

What a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny I don't even care
As you turn to walk away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I have to say",A Good Year for the Roses

Johnny Paycheck,"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.

Johnny Paycheck,"He said ""I'll love you till I die"", she told him ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by, she still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall, went half-crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all, hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed dated nineteen sixty-two
He had underlined in red every single ""I love you""

I went to see him just today, oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away, first time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him one last time. Aww, 'n' we all wondered if she
would. And it kept runnin' through my mind-""this time he's over her for good.""

He stopped loving her today

Johnny Paycheck,"Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Johnny Paycheck,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

And exchange it some day for a crown",The Old Rugged Cross
Johnny Paycheck,"Carolyn let me tell you what I heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
'Til he came to a city, bright in the night time like day
There they say he met with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb, dripped with honey
And somethin' about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm, and not alone

Yes Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe a man will do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home

Johnny Paycheck,"You can find me in a dim light bar-+room
If your coldness should ever turn warm
But the chances of you ever changing
Are as slim as your two loving arms

So I'm turning off a memory
As quickly as time will allow
Yes, I'm turning off a memory
And the wine seems to help me somehow

If he's lucky he'll someday forget her
When the wine finally takes full control
But that's not much of a future to look to
But I can't stand to see the pain in his soul

Singin' my songs, the whereabouts are unknown
They call me no show Jones

Johnny Paycheck,"Miracles appear in the strangest of places 
Fancy meeting you here
The last time I saw you was just out of Houston 
Let me sit down and buy you a beer
Your presence is welcome with me and my friend 
Here this is a hangout of mine
We come here quite often to listen to music 
And to taste of yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine yesterday's wine we're agin' 
With time like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine yesterday's wine we're agin' 
With time like yesterday's wine
You give the appearance of one widely traveled 
I'll bet you've seen things in your time
Come sit down beside us and tell us your story 
If you think you'll like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine",Yesterday's Wine
Johnny Paycheck,"Let's all go down to the river there's a man who's walking on the water
Come along with me for I want to see this man walking on the water
Well he can raise the dead from the grave change the water and turn it into wine
He can make the lame walk and he can make the donk talk
And open up the eyes of the blind
Oh let's all go down to the river...

Jesus is the man at the river and he's washin' people's sins away
He can save your soul if you give him control be ready for that Judgement Day
Let's all go down to the river...
Let's all go down to the river...
Let's all go down to the river...",Let’s All Go Down to the River
