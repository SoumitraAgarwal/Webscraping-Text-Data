Band of Horses,"I'm coming up only to hold you under
I'm coming up only to show you wrong
And to know you is hard, we wonder
To know you, all wrong we were

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Really too late to call, so
We wait for
Morning to wake you, that's all we got
To know me as hardly golden
Is to know me all wrong, they were

At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
Every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
Every occasion, know I'm ready for the funeral
Every occasion, oh, one billion-day funeral

I'm coming up only to show you down, for
I'm coming up only to show you wrong

To the outside the dead leaves, they're on the lawn
Before they died, had trees to hang their hope

Ooh-ooh

At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
Every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
Every occasion, know I'm ready for the funeral

Band of Horses,"Back of the boat was painted wrecking-ball
There was country music playing but he don't like it all
And red fire poppin' on the rained-down woody 
There was whiskey bottle-spilling and a lake, it was made of salt

Well, look out back, there was a note on the door it saying
""Everybody listen, we will be the next Omaha"" 

Well, if you find yourself falling apart
Well, I am sure I could steer
The great salt lake
Falling apart
Well, I am sure I could steer
The great salt lake

Your old man was but a wishing machine
It's time that you could spin
Now that he is getting old
When Billy Lorett had found a watering hole
It's a place to lay south or the heads of coyote

Now, if you find yourself falling apart 
Well I am sure I could steer
The great salt lake

Follow me home
We want more
Follow me home
We all want more
If ever beat down
We know who we are
They know who we are
If ever beat down
We know who we are
They all know we want more",The Great Salt Lake
Band of Horses,"A treat for all these problems
They can't find you for the moment
Then for all past efforts
They're buried deep beneath your heart
And somewhere in your stomach

And hatred for all others
When awful people they surround you

Well, eh, they just like monsters
They come to feed on me
Giant little animals to feed

Vote to say ""we got much hope
If I am lost, it's only for a little while""

Band of Horses,"Out on the wall, sounds of banging is constant, coming from your head 
And desperate, the calls came and ringing from those wanna wring your neck 
Wring your neck 

Open your mouth, sounds of breathing found it spilling from your face
Best to be dim to the humble of traffic stepping on your name

Count on us all, follow our own swords tonight

And chilling walk home down the portions roads they're leading straight to your place
And look like the tin can with swallows the kitchen plugging up your space

Here with the shades down

When I didn't know you
And everything I do
Done badly

Now, I'll love you always
Even when I say
You distract me

And sit out tonight in some strange place
If we have no friends here
Well, I had a few to begin with

To wake next to you in the morning
And good morning to you
How do you do?
Hey, good morning to you!
More covers for you
Sleep soundly dear, 'cause I have to go

And I'll love you always

Some weren't getting along

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee,
They would not dance, they wouldn't follow me.
So I danced for the fishermen,
James and John came with me and the dance went on.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame,
The Holy people said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high,
Left me there on a cross to die.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black,
It's hard who dance with the devil on your back.
They buried my body, they thought I'd gone,
But I am the dance, and I still go on.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

Refrain:
No, nobody does it better than you
Nobody makes me feel like you do
Cause you are the sun that makes my life shine
And you are the love I've always tried to find

I could spend a lifetime
Telling you how bright you shine
And that you're one in a million
I'd give you all my time
And that you're worth more
Than anything that I could ever buy,
If I could, I would give you my life.

So tell me if there's something that you want,
I got it right here.
If there's something that you ask,
I got it right here.
If there's something that you see
That you like
That you feel
That you might need,
I got it right here

And if there's ever something bugging you
Or troubling you,
Then I'll be right there
Hugging you and snuggling you
Until the trouble is trough,
Cause baby girl, we were meant to be
One team
You and me
I can see

Nobody
Filling me with life like you and
Nobody
Who could be my wife like you and
Nobody,
I just want to rise with you to skies so blue

Refrain

You can make a man
Give you all that he's got,
And baby
You can make a man
Treat you hotter than hot,
And baby
You can make a man
Feel that he's on top.
He'll never stop treating you right,
No, he'll never stop, no

I'll spend the rest of my life
Giving you diamonds and pearls
Giving you my whole world, my girl.
And even more, I'll give you
Things that money can't buy.
My friendship,
My time,
My love,
My life

Nobody filling me with life like you and
Nobody who could be my wife like you and
Nobody, I just want to rise with you to skies so blue

Refrain

I need nothing but you
All day and night
And I know that us two
Can make it right
I want you to be by my side

Banda Brava,"Fue en un pueblo con mar
Una noche después de un concierto
Tú reinabas detrás
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto
""Cántame una canción
Al oído y te pongo un cubata""
""Con una condición
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata""
Loco por conocer

Los secretos de su dormitorio
Esa noche canté
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tú saliste a cerrar
Yo me dije

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""
Luego todo pasó
De repente, su dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa

Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Nos Dieron Las Diez

Ya no habra dolor 
Tan solo habra felicidad

Oír tu voz, sentir tu amor

No se vivir si tú no estás

Me hace soñar que estás aquí
Siento tu cuerpo junto a mí
Y al despertar tú ya no estás.

En que otros labios
Mis caricias dejarás
Mientras que aquí

Es un martirio para mí.

Sou seu ursinho,
Sua gatinha,

E nas de calor

Foi um cupido vadio
E ele acertou
Meu coração de jeitinho

No les mientas ni les niegues la verdad

Cómo fue que me aceptasteis otra vez
Diles que sin mí tú ya no vives
Que sin mí tú ya no duermes, que dependes de mi amor

Y es que nuestras diferencias olvidadas se quedan sobre la cama

No lo entiendo palomitas en azul 
Y ni tus luces pequeña

Surteme de cachetadas 
Habla mal de mi 
Con todos tus amigos 

Pero por favor no te olvides mi amor 
Que yo te necesito 
No contestes mis llamadas burlate de mi 
Y olvidate que existo 

Quitame la vida mandame a la tumba 
Pero nunca nunca
Me Dejes En Visto",No Me Dejes En Visto
Banda Los Sebastianes,"Perdon por adjudicarme el derecho de sentirme dueño de tu cuerpo
Por manipular tus sentimientos para alimentar mi ego
Perdón por mirarte siempre a escondidas
Por darte migajas sin medida
Y hablarte con tantas mentiras
Con tal de hacerte mía
Perdón si alguna vez
En vano te juré
Que todo dejaría y me pondría a tus pies
Perdón si te dije te amo

Sólo para ilusionarte y enredarme en tu piel
No Te Mereces que tu vida haga pedazos
Que te busque solamente para dirvertirme un rato
Que estés desperdiciando los mejores años de tu vida
Esperando que algún día te haga parte de la mía
No Te Mereces tantas noches en tu cama
Conformandote tan sólo con acariciar la almohada
Tú te mereces alguien que te de todo su tiempo
Que se enamore también de tus sentimientos

No sólo de tu cuerpo

Puros capos importantes

Eran como una familia
Hasta que empezó el desmadre

Estaba toda la clicka

El licenciado y su gente
El macho llegó más tardé
El azul es pa ragoza
Un teniente y los beltranes

Platicaban de las plazas
Que ya había conquistado
De la coca de colombiano
Que la gente había mandado
Ya los gringos la esperaba
Para surtir el mercado

Ay sinaloa como te quiero
Y estos son los Sebastianes viejo 
Fierro fierro fierro papá

Cada uno de los presentes
Tomaría la palabra
Pa dar su punto de vista
Y reafirmar las alianzas
Mas con el beso de judas
Se perdieron las confianzas
Esa fue la última cena
Como lo dije al principio
Se retiran los señores
Llevándose el compromiso
De hacer el cartel mas fuerte
Siempre firme, siempre unido

Surgieron las controversias
Se vinieron las traiciones

No será un triste recuerdo

In your eyes and war cries 
So much of our lives driven by thoughts of you 
And you and you there way in the back

Part of your day spent thinking of us 
Waiting (just like I used to) for us to show up,

That I could wrap them around everyone I've ever known and loved
Protect them from the crashing waves
The storms that will take us all one at a time
The unheard goodbyes that we are never ready to whisper
Turning once strong men into lost little boys
Standing well dressed staring into six-foot holes

Sick of this chill every time the phone rings too early or too late
The what-if silences that linger in between
Why can't I build a raft strong enough
To carry us through the clouds, the flames

Or any of that shit that I don't believe in
I would do anything not to have to squeeze another trembling body
Who was not ready to face life's end
Tired of sitting slumped in the corner trying not to come apart
As the lines stretch around the building

Why does only death show us how much we truly mean to each other
The beautiful things that we're not ready to lose or have yet to try
Knowledge does not come in books it comes in caskets
I don't wanna see how brave we can be anymore

I've seen the strength it takes to get past and move on
And would trade it all away to know how to keep you here forever
Maybe I've grown too old
Missed out on the glamour and the glory
Just can't see past the tears and the pain
Oh please don't bury me in the rain",Don't Go

Just to close my eyes and tell you
There’ll be one less person in your arms tonight

You were blowin' more than my mind
I was slapping' on your behind
Parked in the bush doing sixty nine

Honey, with you I can do no wrong
That's why I sing this honeymoon song

Your nails were digging in
Your teeth were biting skin
Then you pulled out a big black whip
Took me on some love slave trip

I was screaming for my life
Whatever happened to my wife?
Said to call you Madam X
That ain't no country boy sex

You beat me black and blue for so long
I guess it?s my fate, this honeymoon song

You locked the doors on the Chevy van
Slapped the cuffs on my hands
I couldn't even try to shout
You strapped a red ball in my mouth

I was thinking about the wedding vows
How that's a bad idea now
I was thinking about death do us part
Buddy that's a bad place to start

And oh, where has my sunshine gone?
It's too late, it's my honeymoon song
Oh, my God, it's my honeymoon song",Honeymoon Song
Banjo & Sullivan,"We started in the morning, carried well into the night
Throwing dirty dishes with all our might
Sad commentary on a marriage that has failed
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed

Police pulled into my trailer park
Domestic violence cost [Incomprehensible] after dark
Late night with her boss, says they're trying to make a sale
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed

I'm at home drinking whiskey in my easy chair
Watching Jerry Lawler pulling Andy Kauffman?s hair
Had a suspicion, so I opened up her mail
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed

She used to bring me beer and love all over me
Right before I went on disability
My wiggler ain't so straight, I got whiskey dick
She don't perk it up 'cause, 'cause her ankles got so thick

Well, the moral of this story is sad but true
I love to drink and she loves to screw
Hobo?s got a better life, riding on the rails
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed

Banjo & Sullivan,"Adam, you like having a drink or two
Sometimes twenty if you're feelin' blue
Sometimes one in the morning, so you can get out of bed
Ya like Jim, ya like Jack, ya like Makers Mark
Drinking in the daytime, drinking in the dark
Drinking with a crowd, drinking alone
Drinking in the shower, or drinking on the phone

I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying
Tried to hide it but I'm bad at lying
So I'm still drinking if you're still buying
I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying

Roy you like women but you're a married man
Sneaking around every chance you can
The feminine nation's gonna be the ruination of you
You like brunettes, redheads and bottled blonds
Pulling them jeans off, and mowing them lawns
You're staring down the barrel, it's the same ole' song
'Cause your wife and your girlfriend can't seem to get along

I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying
Having several women is death-defying
If there's eggs to break, I can't help but fry em'
I'm trying to quit but I just quit trying

Roy you like smoking my cheap homegrown
That Mexican Lettuce sure gets you stoned
You cotton-mouth so dry
You'll drink the water from my bong
You like Cencimilla Red and Acapulco Gold
Maui Waui and resin from the bowl
But we ain't wrote a song in so long I don't know
And now Johnny Law's waiting for us after the show

I'm trying to quit, but I just quit trying
So roll me a joint and I'll start flying
Made us laugh so hard that we both started crying

But I could never let it be that way
Mama's life line proved a good noose
With a taste for killing, I was on the loose

My folks hated me for what I did that day
So I slit their throats, sent 'em to their grave
I headed for the Smokie's in Tennessee
Yeah, lot of good killing was ahead of me

I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb

Met a mountain girl from a mining town
Our first time when the sun went down
All she wanted was to marry me
So I cut her where she loved me
And watched her bleed

Her daddy from the holler saw her blood so red
So I drug him in the river and I drowned him dead

I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb

Wore out my welcome in Arkansas
Killed a Christian family of the Pentecost
Georgia Cracker was a talking at me
So I cut out his tongue, hung from a tree

Now the southern law wants to put me in jail
But I'll still be killing when I'm burning in hell

I'm a killer on the lamb

Where my guitar's my only friend
Slurring the words to a hit song from a bottle that never ends

Lord, don't let me die in a cheap motel
Gideon's Bible on the nightstand
Can't save me from the gates of hell
Nothing more to offer, no more soul to sell

Bought her a coke and Jim Bean
Sting of bourbon on her lips
Big tab and twenty dollar tip
She put her hand on my thigh
So I grabbed my wallet and opened wide

She didn't like me but she loved my money
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny
She wanted friends and I wanted honey
She didn't like me but she loved my money

I asked her if I could take her home
Nervous my expense account had grown
She put her bosom to my face
Hope my money didn't go to waste

Getting played by a woman's touch

She didn't like me but she loved my money
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny
She wanted friends and I wanted honey
She didn't like me but she loved my money

I guess I ain't no big bank hank
All my bread wound up in the tank
So I go to bed with her on my mind
And I'm flat broke one more time

A man can only spend so much
Getting played by a woman's touch
But tomorrow night I'll try again
I try to be more than just her friend

Banjo Jim,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise

Marie Antoinette caused the fall of France
So good was her love that my circumstance
It left me in the mud for a second chance
I'm in a love debt because I owe some much
She was with the Joneses I was trying to keep up
Trying to keep my feet above water, fell off the cliff
Can I get a lift? Can I get a tip?
Oh ain't that a trip
When love makes you slip into a love debt
Into regret
But I would do it all again

I could be dreaming through my gold eyes
The cypher's incomplete, undone
If everything is real
I could be speeding to a cold sore

Have you ever had this feeling once in your life
In which you like a girl so much
You wish that she was your wife
But
She's not your girl, she's barely a friend
Just someone you see every now and then
Although seemed impossible my heart has been touched
By this girl who I desperately want in my clutch
As time goes on, I got to know her
And the love that I had inside, I had to show her
She had a man but we had brunches together
The waitress had a hunch that we wanted each other
And yo, she was right
By the end of the night, we satisfied each other's appetite
Like wow

I can't hardly speak
My love
You truly are unique
I should have seen you to the goodtimes

Caramel complexion
We had a strong connection
But somewhere we went the wrong direction
On long walks I would stop to listen
To the sound of the city local street musicians
She lost interest, cut me off in mid-sentence
The rain storm grew to a tempest
The light at the end of the tunnel was a train
Shock at the end of the rumble, wasn't pain
We stumbled, but who could we blame?
The oxycontin, weed, alcohol or cocaine
We pushed out limits in the streets of Venice
Passage for lovers, we only stayed a minute, wow

I can't hardly feel you love
But every time we meet it will be deep of course

What's going on?

I heard her man divorced her

Denn wir sind wieder wer
Zwischen Alpen und Meer
Und vom Rhein bis zur Oder
Wie lange nicht mehr!
Wir sind fürchterlich stolz,
Schwenken schwarz, rot und gold,
Singen Hymnen so laut
Wie lange nicht mehr!
Deutsch-besoffen vor Glück,
Keinen Blick mehr zurück.
Nur noch voran, wie Panzer
Wie lange nicht mehr!
Wer nicht mitläuft hat Pech
„Auf die Seite! Aus dem Weg!
Hier kommt Deutschland!“

[You never showed, never came]

You said your love was strong for me
I must face reality
I believed and called your name, oh
[You never came]
Now I'm alone on my way home
Just a fool who played the game
With a love I thought I knew

Oh, yes, I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I tried to hide my emotions
But my lips kept on saying your name

No show

I thought at last love came to pass
In my life was a chance
To believe in someone new like you
We waited for the perfect day
For you and I to slip away
Become one inside our dreams

Oh, but I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

I stood in the falling rain (You never came)
You never showed, never came (Hurt me so, baby, why didn't you show in the 
falling rain)
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

I stood in the falling rain (I thought that you loved me)
You never showed, never came (When you and I had made our plans, baby)
I stood in the falling rain (We waited for the perfect day)
You never showed, never came (Darling, I stood in the falling rain)

I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
Stood in the falling rain

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say I came up up with more secrets to tell you today
These are my confessions
Slip my mind the last two times
Silly me, so now I gotta give you part three of my confessions
First I told you about the skank that I was cheating with,then I mentioned she's having my kid
That's not all, now I recall more you see, so I'll give you part three of my confessions

Now this is gonna be the hardest thing I ever had to do,
Gonna tell you everything I left out of parts one and two
Like remember when I told you I knew Paulie Shore (Paulie Shore)
That's a lie, I don't know what I said that for
I borrowed your chapstick (from you)
I tried out your nose hair trimmer (too)
And by the way your diamond ring is cubic circonium,
I killed your goldfish accidently, just replaced it with another one

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say I needed to get some things off my chest right away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions
I threw up on your dog last time I had too much to drink
There have been times when I've peed in your sink
Don't know why, but you and I should agree that belongs in part three of my confessions

Baby forgive me I'm still trying to figure out why 
I used your toothbrush to clean off the bathroom grought
Oh and sometimes in private, I really like to dress up as Shirley Temple and spank myself with a hockey stick (hockey stick)
My boss thinks I'm a jerk, I didn't get that raise.
I haven't changed my underwear in twenty-seven days!
And when I'm kissing you I fantasize you as a midget
I'm so sorry Debbi! I mean Bridget!

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say I got a few more secrets I'd like to convey
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions
Gave you buttered toast I dropped and then picked up off the floor
FYI it was not a cold sore
Ooops my bad, but you'll be madder at me when I finish part three of my confessions

You don't know how hard it is for me to tell you this, 
But remember that shirt that you got me for my birthday?
Well, I returned it for store credit. That thing was hideous, what were you thinking?
O and by the way, I wasn't really sick last week,
I just didn't wanna go to your stupid office picnic
Oh and when I told you at breakfast we were all out of rice krispies,
What I meant was that there was only enough left for me. Sorry.

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say, I thought of some more things that should scare you away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions
Once I blew my nose and wiped it on your cat
And I lied, yes that dress makes you look fat
Anyway, I shouldn't say anymore 'til I give you part four of my confessions",Confession

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me

Voilà c'qui pousse petite soeur à faire escort
Petit-frère lui importe et exporte toutes sortes de choses

Triste réalité

J'ai voulu que des frères mais j'ai eu trop d'potes

Disons qu'le ssite-gro déconne
On apprécie la paix quand on est dans la violence
En nous s'installe la haine quand on est en manque d'argent

C'est le cerveau d'nos parents qui maintenant trinque
À cette allure on a des chances d'être foutus

Le manque de force, la haine depuis, nous caressent
Qu'est-ce que tu crois toi? C'est la hass

Barathrum,"Fire!

I bring the fire from the hell
I am a demon warrior
Listen for this doom bell
It tolls for this burning torch

I bring this torch from the flames
From the flames of Inferno
I bring the end for the days
Of angels' existence
I hunt those white dressed creatures
Creatures with their white wings
My own wings are black skin
And my claws steel

When I meet the angels of the light
I show no mercy for them
I tie them with barbed wire
And then crucify
I cut the veins of heaven's creature
I spill the holy blood
I am the tormentor of saints
And judge from hell

My dark and evil wrath is huge
I have ripped countless angels
And I have brought the fuel
For inferno's high flames
Those flames are getting higher
Til they reach those golden gates
And my deepest desire
Is to destroy all beyond those gates

Lighting up the weather wings
Tearing the burning corpse
And the choir of heaven sings
No, no more",Angelburner
Barathrum,"One hundred of satan's angels, somehow they lost to the heaven
And what a helluva party, they had over there
Two hundred skin winged demons, they made an invasion to the gates
Gates left golden dust behind them, after they were rumbling down
And sixty devilish creatures, attacked against the walls
And those walls of the heaven, were crushed by their force
Fifty dark minded beasts, with their wings of steel
They made a raid to the temple, and it's tower of the gold

Another fifty steel winged ones, they landed on the yard
On the yard of that temple, they massacred angels of God
One hundred warriors of Lucifer, they brought the fire with them
And they made storm of fire, that blew over paradise
And behold, one hundred and six, monsters from the inferno
They brought the nuclear destruction, that devastated The Holy Realm
The legions of the hell, attacked to the heaven
There were no survivors, after this invasion from the hell

Dreams turned to nightmares
Heaven changed to hell
Light turned to dark
White changed to black
Good turned to evil
Green changed to red
Colours of the heaven
Changed to negative

Last day in heaven...!

I fear to see another day 
Another day that is filled with this emptiness 

Just in darkness I can take my breath 
Oh, and I think that even darkness is gone 
Hell in my soul with hundreds of torturing demons 
All my hope seems to be like sand 
Never well-kept in my shivering hands 
Never stop running down from my fingers 
Alone in the dark I just howl for the moon 

Bleeding heart inside me 
Light of sanity is gone 
I think that I am lost 
No one close that could be with me 
No one close that could be just me 
I used to have one of nocturnal beauty 
Killer of pain, the one that kissed 
Kissed in the way that I could kill for 
Anything, anyone; except the one 

Misery, agony, dark pain is ripping my soul
Desperation, depression, all light is gone
Torment, death, reaper's blade is close
Sadness, darkness, you fill my soul with those

Cliff is close, sinister feeling
The overdose of darkness creeping
For all those demons who tear

My own soul which is filled with fear
I welter in pain, come, hold me tight
I wish the gain from touch of the night
The one that I care I'd like to return
Once more to share the warmth of the flames that burn

The darkness is tearing and ripping inside
The light of sanity is leaving my mind
I think that I will go insane
I run in night can't stay in light of day

Did I just die, did I reach the bound?
The bound between life and realm after death
Am I alive or did I just die?
Do I dream, am I awake
Is this real or just a vision?
If this is vision, it's incredibly great
If I am dead, why the hell I had life?
Could it be true that just died because I feel that I fly
Like flying through the misty air, after all I just don't care
I don't care, if I am dead or alive
I don't care, if I am dreaming or awake
I don't care, I just feel sp great
I don't care, I do not care
Could it be true that just died because I feel that I fly
Like flying through the misty air, after all I just don't care

Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

Who do you love,
Who do you love, Who do you love, Who do you love.

And said oooh eeeh daddy I understand.
Who do you love,
Who do you love, Who do you love, Who do you love.

And around the corner an ice wagon flew.
A bump was a hittin' lord and somebody screemed,
You should have heard just what I seen.

Ils me suivent pas à pas.
Je leur échappe pas,
Mes hommes, mes hommes.

Où que je sois, ils sont là,
Mes hommes.
Je n'ai qu'à tendre les bras,
En somme.
Je les regarde venir,
Fière de leur appartenir.
C'est beau de les voir sourire,

Moi qui suis fille des brumes,
En somme,
De la nuit et de la lune,
Tout comme,

Ils ne m'appellent Madame,

Mais, tendrement, ils me nomment
Patronne.
Ils se soumettent à ma loi.
Je me soumets à leur loi.
Que c'est doux d'obéir
A mes hommes.

 Tout d'amour et de tendresse, 
Mes hommes,
M'ont fait une forteresse,
Mes hommes.
Non, vous ne passerez pas.
C'est à eux, n'y touchez pas.
Ils sont violents, quelquefois,
Mes hommes, mes hommes.

Ils se sont fait sentinelles,

Ils me veillent, comme moi
Je les veille quelquefois.
Moi pour eux, et eux pour moi,

Quand naissent les premières feuilles
D'automne,
Quand le chagrin se fait lourd,

A pas de loup, ils s'esquivent.

Ils vont coucher leur peau douce,

Barbara,"J'ai eu tort, je suis revenue
Dans cette ville, au loin, perdue
Où j'avais passé mon enfance
J'ai eu tort, j'ai voulu revoir
Le côteau où glisse le soir
Bleu et gris, ombre de silence
Et j'ai retrouvé, comme avant
Longtemps après
Le côteau, l'arbre se dressant
Comme au passé
J'ai marché, les tempes brûlantes
Croyant étouffer sous mes pas
Les voix du passé qui nous hantent
Et reviennent sonner le glas
Et je me suis couchée sous l'arbre
Et c'était les mêmes odeurs
Et j'ai laissé couler mes pleurs
Mes pleurs
J'ai mis mon dos nu à l'écorce
L'arbre m'a redonné des forces
Tout comme au temps de mon enfance
Et longtemps, j'ai fermé les yeux
Je crois que j'ai prié un peu
Je retrouvais mon innocence
Avant que le soir ne se pose
J'ai voulu voir
La maison fleurie sous les roses
J'ai voulu voir
Le jardin où nos cris d'enfants
Jaillissaient comme sources claires
Jean, Claude et Régine et puis Jean
Tout redevenait comme hier
Le parfum lourd des sauges rouges
Les dahlias fauves dans l'allée
Le puits, tout, j'ai retrouvé
Hélas

La guerre nous avait jetés là
D'autres furent moins heureux, je croix
Au temps joli de leur enfance
La guerre nous avait jetés là
Nous vivions comme hors-la-loi
Et j'aimais celà, quand j'y pense
Oh mes printemps, oh mes soleils
Oh mes folles années perdues
Oh mes quinze ans, oh mes merveilles
Que j'ai mal d'être revenue
Oh les noix fraîches de Septembre
Et l'odeur des mûres écrasées
C'est fou, tout, j'ai tout retrouvé
Hélas

Ils ne faut jamais revenir
Au temps caché des souvenirs
Du temps béni de mon enfance
Car parmi tous les souvenirs
Ceux de l'enfance sont les pires
Ceux de l'enfance nous déchirent
Vous, ma très chérie, ô ma mère
Où êtez-vous donc, aujourd'hui
Vous dormez au chaud de la terre
Et moi, je suis venue ici, pour y retrouver votre rire
Vos colères et votre jeunesse
Mais je suis seule avec ma détresse
Hélas

Pourquoi suis-je donc revenue

Et de longues nuits désolées
La garce ! Elle nous ferait même 
L'hiver au plein coeur de l'été

Dans ta triste robe de moire 
Avec tes cheveux mal peignés
T'as la mine du désespoir
Tu n'es pas belle à regarder
Allez, va t-en porter ailleurs 
Ta triste gueule de l'ennui
Je n'ai pas le goût du malheur
Va t-en voir ailleurs si j'y suis 

Je veux encore rouler des hanches
Je veux me saouler de printemps
Je veux m'en payer, des nuits blanches
A coeur qui bat, à coeur battant
Avant que sonne l'heure blême 
Et jusqu'à mon souffle dernier
Je veux encore dire je t'aime
Et vouloir mourir d'aimer

Elle a dit Ouvre-moi ta porte
Je t'avais suivie pas à pas
Je sais que tes amours sont mortes
Je suis revenue, me voilà
Ils t'ont récité leurs poèmes
Tes beaux messieurs, tes beaux enfants
Tes faux Rimbaud, tes faux Verlaine
Eh ! bien, c'est fini, maintenant

Depuis, elle me fait des nuits blanches
Elle s'est pendue à mon cou
Elle s'est enroulée à mes hanches
Elle se couche à mes genoux
Partout, elle me fait escorte 
Et elle me suit, pas à pas
Elle m'attend devant ma porte

Quand tout à coup, venu de ta planète,
Le téléphone sonne sur mon île déserte
Et c'était toi, ô toi

Allô, allô, mon coeur, me murmurait ta voix
Je n'étais pas ton coeur et c'était une erreur
Mais, je n'ai pas raccroché
Et tu n'as pas raccroché
Et si je n'ai jamais su qui tu cherchais
J'ai tout de même compris que l'on s'était trouvés

Barbara,"Un beau jour ou peut-être une nuit
Près d'un lac, je m'étais endormie
Quand soudain, semblant crever le ciel
Et venant de nulle part surgit un aigle noir

Lentement, les ailes déployées
Lentement, je le vis tournoyer
Près de moi dans un bruissement d'ailes
Comme tombé du ciel, l'oiseau vint se poser

Il avait des yeux couleur rubis
Et des plumes couleur de la nuit
À son front brillant de mille feux
L'oiseau roi couronné portait un diamant bleu

De son bec, il a touché ma joue
Dans ma main il a glissé son cou
C'est alors que je l'ai reconnu
Surgissant du passé, il m'était revenu

Dis l'oiseau, oh dis emmène-moi
Retournons au pays d'autrefois
Comme avant dans mes rêves d'enfant
Pour cueillir en tremblant des étoiles, des étoiles

Comme avant dans mes rêves d'enfant
Comme avant sur un nuage blanc
Comme avant allumer le soleil
Être faiseur de pluie et faire des merveilles

La pas cruelle.
Quand je vous quitte,
Je vais, cheveux aux vent.
Je vais cueillir
La petite fleur des champs
Mais, pour vous plaire,
Lorsque revient le soir,
Sous les lumières,
Ange du désespoir.

Je suis la très mystérieuse,
La noire, la fleur vénéneuse,
Ni belle, ni bonne,
Je n'aime personne
Et je passe, bonjour,
Et je passe, bonjour","Ni Belle, Ni Bonne"

Barbara,"A voir tant de gens qui dorment et s'endorment à la nuit,
Je finirai, c'est fatal, par pouvoir m'endormir aussi.
A voir tant d'yeux qui se ferment, couchés dans leur lit,
Je finirai par comprendre qu'il faut que je m'endorme aussi.

J'en ai connu des grands, des beaux, des bien bâtis, des gentils
Qui venaient pour me bercer et combattre mes insomnies
Mais au matin, je les retrouvais, endormis dans mon lit
Pendant que je veillais seule, en combattant mes insomnies.

A force de compter les moutons qui sautent dans mon lit,
J'ai un immense troupeau qui se promène dans mes nuits.
Qu'ils aillent brouter ailleurs, par exemple, dans vos prairies.
Labourage et pâturage ne sont pas mes travaux de nuit,

Sans compter les absents qui me reviennent dans mes nuits.
J'ai quelquefois des vivants qui me donnent des insomnies
Et je gravis mon calvaire, sur les escaliers de la nuit.
J'ai déjà connu l'enfer, connaîtrai-je le paradis ?

Le paradis, ce serait, pour moi, de m'endormir la nuit
Mais je rêve que je rêve qu'on a tué mes insomnies
Et que, pâles, en robe blanche, on les a couchées dans un lit
A tant rêver que j'en rêve, les revoilà, mes insomnies.

Je rôde comme les chats, je glisse comme les souris
Et Dieu, lui-même, ne sait pas ce que je peux faire de mes nuits.

Mourir ou s'endormir, ce n'est pas du tout la même chose.
Pourtant, c'est pareillement se coucher les paupières closes.
Une longue nuit, où je les avais tous deux confondus,
Peu s'en fallut, au matin, que je ne me réveille plus.

Mais au ciel de mon lit, y avait les pompiers de Paris.
Au pied de mon lit, les adjudants de la gendarmerie.
Ô Messieurs dites-moi, ce que vous faites là, je vous prie.
Madame, nous sommes là pour veiller sur vos insomnies.

En un cortège chagrin, viennent mes parents, mes amis.
Gravement, au nom du Père, du Fils et puis du Saint-Esprit,
Si après l'heure, c'est plus l'heure, avant, ce ne l'est pas non plus,
Ce n'est pas l'heure en tout cas, mais grand merci d'être venus.

Je les vois déjà rire de leurs fines plaisanteries,
Ceux qui prétendent connaître un remède à mes insomnies.
Un médecin pour mes nuits, j'y avais pensé, moi aussi.
C'est contre lui que je couche mes plus belles insomnies.

A voir tant de gens qui dorment et s'endorment à la nuit,
J'aurais fini, c'est fatal, par pouvoir m'endormir aussi
Mais si s'endormir c'est mourir, ah laissez-moi mes insomnies.
J'aime mieux vivre en enfer que dormir en paradis.
Si s'endormir c'est mourir, ah laissez-moi mes insomnies.
J'aime mieux vivre en enfer que de mourir en paradis... 
=============================================================
(ENGLISH VERSION)
To see so many people who fall asleep and sleep at night,
I will finish this fatal power by also asleep.
To see so many eyes are closed, lying in their beds,
I'll understand that I have m'endorme too.

I have experienced great, beautiful and well built, nice
Who came to me and soothed my combat insomnia
But in the morning, I found, asleep in my bed
While I will only fighting my insomnia.

A force of counting sheep jumping in my bed,
I have a huge flock that walks into my nights.
Let them go to graze elsewhere, for example, in your grasslands.
Tillage and pasture are not my work at night,

Not counting absentees that I return to my nights.
I sometimes live give me insomnia
And I climbed my ordeal on the stairs of the night.
I have seen hell, I know paradise?

Paradise, it would be for me to sleep at night
But I dream that I dream that has killed my insomnia
And that, pale, white dress, they were lying in bed
A dream that as I dream, they are back again, my insomnia.

I like cats prowls, I glide like mice
And God himself does not know what I can make my nights.

Die or fall asleep, this is not the same thing.
Yet it is equally lie eyelids closed.
A long night, when I had them both together,
Soon it was the morning that I wake up more.

But the sky from my bed, there were firefighters in Paris.
At the foot of my bed, warrant officers of the gendarmerie.
Oh gentlemen tell me, what you doing here, please.
Madame, we are here to ensure your insomnia.

In a procession grief come my parents, my friends.
Seriously, the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
If after hours, more time before, it is not either,
This is not the time in any case, but thank you for coming.

I see them already laugh at their jokes fine,
Those who claim to know a cure for my insomnia.
A doctor for my nights, I had thought, too.
It is against him that I sleep my best insomnia.

To see so many people who fall asleep and sleep at night,
I had finished, it is fatal, for power also asleep
But if you die asleep, ah let me my insomnia.
I would rather live in hell that sleep in paradise.
If you die asleep, ah let me my insomnia.
I would rather live in hell than to die in heaven ...",Les Insomnies

Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Il est des filles à Grenade

A l'amour demandent merci 
Il en est que parfois embrassent

Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent

Ce n'est pas sur ce ton frivole 
Qu'il faut parler de Padilla 
Car jamais prunelle espagnole 
D'un feu plus chaste ne brilla 
Elle fuyait ceux qui pourchassent 
Les filles sous les peupliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Elle prit le voile à Tolède 
Au grand soupir des gens du lieu 
Comme si, quand on n'est pas laide 
On avait droit d'épouser Dieu 
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent 
Les soudards et les écoliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Or, la belle à peine cloîtrée 
Amour en son cœur s'installa 
Un fier brigand de la contrée 
Vint alors et dit : ""Me voilà!"" 
Quelquefois les brigands surpassent 
En audace les chevaliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent

Il était laid : les traits austères

Mais l'amour a bien des mystères 
Et la nonne aima le brigand

Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent

Au brigand par l'enfer conduit 
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique 
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit 
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent 
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent

Or quand, dans la nef descendue 
La nonne appela le bandit 
Au lieu de la voix attendue 
C'est la foudre qui répondit 
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent

Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Saint Ildefonse, abbé, voulut

Lentement, les ailes déployées
Lentement, je le vis tournoyer
Près de moi dans un bruissement d'ailes
Comme tombé du ciel, l'oiseau vint se poser

Il avait des yeux couleur rubis
Et des plumes couleur de la nuit
À son front brillant de mille feux
L'oiseau roi couronné portait un diamant bleu

De son bec, il a touché ma joue
Dans ma main il a glissé son cou

Surgissant du passé, il m'était revenu

Barbara,"Dans les paniers d'osier de la salle des ventes 
Une gloire déchue des folles années trente 
Avait mis aux enchères, parmi quelques brocantes 
Un vieux bijou donné par quel amour d'antan 

Elle était là, figée, superbe et déchirante 
Ses mains qui se nouaient, se dénouaient tremblantes 
Des mains belles encore, déformées, les doigts nus 
Comme sont nus, parfois, les arbres en Novembre 

Comme tous les matins, dans la salle des ventes 
Bourdonnait une foule, fiévreuse et impatiente 
Ceux qui, pour quelques sous, rachètent pour les vendre 
Les trésors fabuleux d'un passé qui n'est plus 

Dans ce vieux lit cassé, en bois de palissandre 
Que d'ombres enlacées, ont rêvé à s'attendre 
Les choses ont leurs secrets, les choses ont leurs légendes 
Mais les choses nous parlent si nous savons entendre

Une fois, puis deux fois, alors, dans le silence 
Elle cria: ""Je prends, je rachète tout ça 
Ce que vous vendez là, c'est mon passé à moi"" 

C'était trop tard, déjà, dans la salle des ventes

Près des paniers d'osier, dans la salle des ventes 
Une femme pleurait ses folles années trente 
Et revoyait soudain défiler son passé 
Défiler son passé, défiler son passé 

Car venait de surgir, du fond de sa mémoire 
Du fond de sa mémoire, un visage oublié 
Une image chérie, du fond de sa mémoire 
Son seul amour de femme, son seul amour de femme 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Froissant quelques billets, dedans ses main tremblantes 
Froissant quelques billets, du bout de ses doigts nus 
Quelques billets froissés, pour un passé perdu

De ses amours d'antan, rien ne lui restait plus

on l'a échappé belle
non je ne suis plus pareille
ah le chant des sirènes...
Mais maintenant je suis lasse
j'en ai marre d'être seule
je voudrais que tu me surprennes
que tu viennes sans rancune
je veux que tu peuples mon île
avec tes idées folles
pour mettre un peu de sel
tu sais je ne suis plus pareille
ah le chant des sirènes...",Le Chant des Sirenes
Barbara Carlotti,"Les femmes en zibeline
promènent leur grand style
devant les vitrines
des grands magasins
Dansent immobiles
leurs regards de bille
ces âmes futiles
ont la vie facile
Des dollars s'alignent
dans leurs yeux qui brillent
elle veulent avoir chaud
car l'hiver les tient
et sur les réclames
dans les magazines
on empile des fesses
des bouches et des seins
Elles pleurent de détresse
personne ne les touche
pas même les singes,
les loups, ni les ours
Alors elles achètent
pour leurs peaux satins
des poils de tigresse
des peaux de lapin
(Refrain)
Les femmes en zibeline
dans les quartiers chics
promènent leurs trésors
sur leur petits seins
Les destins tragiques
des animaux morts
qui caressent leurs corps
quand l'hiver les tient
C'est leur seule caresse
puisqu'on les délaisse
leur petit toutou
a brisé sa laisse
et sous leur renard
elles n'ont qu'un espoir
vendre la peau de l'ours
pour l'amour ce soir",Les Femmes en Zibeline

Il n'est pas diffi cile
ici de contempler

au passage d'un vent léger
Ici les cigales peuvent chanter

il faut faire quelque chose
pour la nature
Il faut inventer des histoires
et devenir sourd aux rumeurs
il faut se remettre à l'air pur
et débrancher les transistors
Il faut danser dans l'eau qui dort
et parler le langage des fleurs
Faut-il donner aux animaux
des drogues dures ?
Oublier la fonte des glaces
et sans arrêt changer de place ?
Il faut remettre de la couleur
et chanter à l'oreille des morts

sur cette mauvaise musique
Vous dansiez seul
vos gestes désarticulés

que cette danse était insolite
vous dansiez...
et dans vos yeux le monde glissait
Vous dansiez
pâle spectre aux gestes pathétiques
Vous dansiez seul
sur cette mauvaise musique
Une drôle d'arithmétique
scandant de vieux poncifs usés
Vous dansiez
autour de vous tout était factice
Vous dansiez
votre justaucorps lamé
Sous la boule à facettes immobile
ces vagues lumières bariolées
que le monde semblait déplacé
Mais vous dansiez...
sans vous arrêter

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

I don't know my elbow from my ear

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

I wanna go and bounce the moon

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?

Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break!

How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy

Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.

Shines around me like a million suns,

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table blaow
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin', not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin' Sega
And buggin' on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin' on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin' just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin' wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin' in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin

Aiyyo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin' nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin' clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin' no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

Barbara Cook,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon
Barbara Cook,"River it like to flow
Eagle it like to fly
Eagle it like to feel
Its wings against the sky

Possum it like to run
Ivy it like to climb
Bird in the tree and bumble bee
Want freedom in autumn or summertime

Ever since that day
When the world was an onion
""Twas natch'ral for the spirit
To soar and play

The way the Lawd'a-wanted it
Free as the sun is free
That's how it's gotta be

Is right for me
We gotta be free

Barbara Cook,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin
Barbara Cook,"It was written in the stars
What was written in the stars shall be
It was written in the skies
That the heart and not the eyes shall see
 
And so whether it bring joy
Whether it bring woe
It shall be done
Now suddenly I know
You are the one
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands

Or I'll never be free

Crazy though I may be

Barbara Cook,"I fell in love with you the first time I looked into them there eyes.
You've got a certain little cute way of flirtin' with them there eyes.
They make make me feel so happy; 
They make me feel so blue.
I'm fallin',  no stallin' 
Fallin' in a big way for sweet little you.

My heart is jumping; you sure started something with them there eyes;
You'd better watch out, little brown eyes, if you're wise.
They sparkle and they bubble; they're gonna get you in a whole mess of trouble.

Barbara Cook,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song [From Meet Me In St. Louis] [DVD][Live]
Barbara Cook,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start?
Barbara Dane,"Oh, where is little Maggie
Over yonder she stands,
Rifle on her shoulder,
Six-shooter in her hand.

How can I ever stand it,
Just to see them two blue eyes,
Shinin' like some diamonds,
Like some diamonds in the sky.

Rather be in some lonely hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine,
Than to see you be another man's darling,
And to know that you'll never be mine.

Well, it's march me away to the station
With my suitcase in my hand,
Yes, march me away to the station,
I'm off to some far-distant land.

Sometimes I have a nickel,
And sometimes I have a dime,
Sometimes I have ten dollars,
Just to pay for little Maggie's wine.

Pretty flowers are made for blooming,
Pretty stars are made to shine,
Pretty girls are made for boy's love,
Little Maggie was made for mine.

Well, yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hand,
She's a drinkin' down her troubles
Over courtin' some other man.",Little Maggie

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

And no hero out of books 
Is my man

That he likes as well as me

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

you say I don't respect you any more
And if you're right it doesn't rain in England
If you're right they don't drink wine in France
If you're right the castle played piano
and Fred Astaire could never really danse

My eyes are close to tears I can't believe I hear the words you say

Oh no

You tell me there's no point to make it work when we've lost yesterday

Oh no

And if your right then love's a game for children
Just a game of seaside touch and run
And if your right then Shakespeare wrote a long lost play
Called Romeo and something or someone

Don't waste what's left of love close and bar the door

There's no need

One time for memories just feel it like you know it felt before
And you'll see
That if I'm right it'll pour with rain in England
If I'm right they'll raise a glass in France
And if I'm right your'e wrong and that's just fine by me
'Cos that means that our love's still got a chance.",If You're Right
Barbara Dickson,"Nothing it so good it lasts eternally.
Perfect situations must go wrong.
But this has never yet prevented me,
Wanting far too much for far too long.

Looking back, I could have played it differently,
Learned about the man before I fell,
But it took time to understand the man,
Now at least I know I know him well.

Wasn't it good
(Oh so good)
Wasn't it fine
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine.
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
(More security)
He needs his fantasies and freedom
I know him so well.

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side,
And though I move my world to be with him,
Still the gap between him is too much.

Looking back I could have played it differently,
One or a few more who can tell,
But I was ever so much younger then,
Now at least I know I know him well.

Wasn't it good

Why am I falling apart.

Barbara Dickson,"There was a child named Bernadette
I heard the story long ago
She saw the Queen of Heaven once
And kept the vision in her soul
No one believed what she had seen
No one believed what she heard
But there were sorrows to be here
And mercy, mercy in this world

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you, come on let me hold you
Like Bernadette would do
 
 We've been around, we fall, we fly
We mostly fall, we mostly run
And every now and then we try
To mend the damage that we've done
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest
I've got this joy inside my breast
To think that I did not forget that child
That song of Bernadette

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine

Who hold to the game
Through the hard times

They keep watching for signs in the land
They keep watching for signs in the land
And they stand there watching the sky
And they stand there ready to fly

Here's to never letting go
Though sometimes it does get lonely

I still walk out in the morning light
Just to see what is there
I hear music in silent nights
Searching I find a reason to care
One heart moving still the same
Still in the game

Here's to lovers who reach for it all
Never matching the rise with the fall
And they just can't leave it alone
And they want it all till it's gone
Here's to players who can't leave their song
And it haunts them
Their night is so long
Cause there's music there in their mind
From a world they're trying to find

Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

Barbara Dickson,"When winter's shadowy fingers
First pursue you down the street
And your boots no longer lie
About the cold around your feet

Do you spare a thought for summer
Whose passage is complete
Whose memories lie in ruins
And whose ruins lie in heat
When winter comes howling in

When the wind is singing strangely
Blowing music through your head
And your rain splattered windows
Make you decide to stay in bed

Do you spare a thought for the homeless tramp
Who wishes he was dead
Or do you pull your bedclothes higher
Dream of summertime instead?
When winter comes howling in

The creeping cold has fingers
That caress without permission
And mystic crystal snowdrops
Only aggravate the condition

Do you spare one thought for the gypsy
With no secure position
Who's turned and spurned by village and town
At the magistrate's decision
When winter comes howling in

When the turkey's in the oven
And the Christmas presents are bought
And Santa's in his module
He's an American astronaut

Do you spare one thought for Jesus
Who had nothing but his thoughts
Who got busted just for talking
And befriending the wrong sorts?
When winter comes howling in
When winter comes howling in

",Winter's Song
Barbara Dickson,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange

That I still need your love after all that I've done

At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change

Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows I don't mean to be unkind

Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea
And lovers found the place they like to be
How many times before this song was ending

Whenever I shall go away 
I'll be longing for the day
That I will be in Greenville again

When the guitar picker turned to rock 'n' roll
And every time when summer nights are falling
I always will be calling dreams of yesterday

What was written in the stars shall be
It was written in the skies
That the heart and not the eyes shall see
 
And so whether it bring joy
Whether it bring woe
It shall be done
Now suddenly I know
You are the one
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands
 
It was written high above
That I have to have your love
Or I'll never be free
And cloudy though the day be
Crazy though I may be
What the stars foretold shall be
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands
 
It was written high above
That I have to have your love
Or I'll never be free
And cloudy though the day be
Crazy though I may be
What the stars foretold shall be
 
And so shall it be",It Was Written in the Stars
Barbara Fasano,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Barbara Fowler,"There's a spark of magic in your eyes 
Candyland appears each time you smile 
Never thought that fairy tales come true 
But they come true, when I'm near you 

You're a genie in disguise 
Full of wonder and surprise, and 

Betcha by golly, wow 
You're the one that I've been waiting for, forever 
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong 
Keep growing strong 

If I could, I'd catch a falling star 
To shine on you So I'll know where you are 
All the rainbows in your favorite shades 
To show I love you, thinking of you 

Write your name across the sky 
Anything you ask, I'll try 

'Cause betcha by golly, wow 
You're the one that I've been waiting for, forever 
And ever will my love for you, keep growing strong

Barbara Hendricks,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Barbara Hendricks,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Barbara Hendricks,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Barbara Hendricks,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry.

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

With memories
That never die

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Send back my love

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

Barbara Lamb,"If you find me in a gloom, or catch me in a dream
Inside my lonely room, there is no in between
Whispering pines, rising of the tide
If only one star shines
That's just enough to get inside
I will wait until it all goes 'round
With you in sight, the lost are found
Foghorn through the night, calling out to sea
Protect my only light, 'cause she once belonged to me
Let the waves rush in, let the seagulls cry
For if I live again, these hopes will never die
I can feel you standing there
But I don't see you anywhere

Standing by the well(standing by the well), wishing for the rains(wishing for the rains)
Reaching to the clouds(reaching to the clouds), for nothing else remains
Drifting in a daze, when evening will be done
Try looking through a haze
At an empty house, in the cold, cold sun
I will wait until it all goes round
With you in sight, the lost are found",Whispering Pines
Barbara Lea,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Barbara Lea,"Baltimore Oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho-down Louisiana
Where a two-tiin' Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O

I'd like to ruffle his plumage
That Baltimore Oriole
Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy-it's a woman like, now and then

Barbara Lea,"I had myself a true love
A true love who was something to see
I had myself a true love
At least that's what I kept on telling me

The first thing in the morning
I still try to think of a way to be with him
Some part of the evening
And that's the way I live through the day

I had myself a true love, but now he's gone
And left me for good
The lord knows I don't hear those back yard
Whispers going round the neighborhood

There maybe a lot of things I miss
A lot of things I don't know
But I do know this, now I ain't got no love
And once upon a time I had a true love

In the evening, in the doorway
While I stand there and wait for his coming
With the house swept and the clothes hung
And a pot on the stove where I had meal

Where is he while I waste the rising newel?
Where is he? Why'd he gone so soon?
Now there ain't no way that it used to be, what now?
And everybody keeps telling me

There are may be a lot of things I miss

Barbara Lea,"Happiness comes with success
And that I guess is true
But success is more or less
A point of view

I'm no millionaire
But I'm not the type to care
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams
It's my universe
Even with an empty purse
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams

I wouldn't take the wealth of Wall Street
For a road where nature trods
And I calculate that I'm worth my weight
In golden rods

I can live in luxury

You must fall in love again with nobody but me
For now that I see you
I know that we should have met long ago

Where have you been?
I wanna know where have you been?
My life was a loosing fight till the lucky night
Baby, you happened in

From what I had heard about love
I thought it was all sorrow and sin
But now that we meet at last, I forget what's past
Baby, where have you been?

I was a fool un-befriended
In the debts of despair
When out of the blue you descended
And somehow ended every care

So if you will give me a break
And all of the love seem to begin
So close to your side I'll stay, you will never say
""Baby, where have you been?""
