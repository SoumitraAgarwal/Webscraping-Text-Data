Mase,"See, the difference with me
When I do what I do 
I do what I'm doing 
But I'm doing it like I'm doing it for TV

Oww, oww, oww, oww, oww
Keep ya hands up
What, what, put your hands up
Come on, come on, keep your hands up

We back, we back, we back, we back (put your hands up)
We back, we back again (keep your hands up)
We back, we back, we back, we back, we back, we back

I remember the days of prayin' my chips be right
Louie the 13, no more Cris tonight
Gold to me is like Superman and Kryptonite
So I pray how I don't miss my flight, switch to night
Get out the plane, it look all strange
See a man from Spain, holding up my name
Give him my things and head down to bag' claim
And I hear somebody scream my name

So I look back, look once, look twice
Look fast, look left, look right
Look Blink, look Meeno, look Myse
They try tell me honey don't look right
So, I approach her, it all look Kosher
But there was kids runnin' up with posters
And I was startin' to lose sight of chauffer
So I had to say nice to know ya
Get ready

Get ready, tonight
We're gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight
We're gonna make this a night to remember

What, what, what, what, what, what
Get money all over again
Get money all over again
Come on, uh, uh, All Out

Uh, yo, it just so happen this how Ma$e stay starred
Flip two aces and get two face cards
It happens, chip stackin'
I turn around, see a bunch of chicks clappin'
But a girl walked by, caught my eye
So I said, 'What the fuck, stand here and give me luck'
And she whispered in my ear
A purple one on there and put a pink one on there
I did just that and gave Hud a stack, shout 'I'll be right back'
In fact, I'ma be over here talkin' to love
Said you Been Around the World, been so many places
Hit so many girls, and spent so many faces
And every girl in the world know who Ma$e is
But right now that's really not what the case is
Let's be real, I know you got bills
So how 'bout one night and I just gave you a mil'
Whatchu feel

Get ready, tonight
We're gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight
We're gonna make this a night to remember

What, what, what, what, what, what
All Out
Wanna Blow
H World, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I don't rap for Rollies, I rap for Starbucks
I'm that star who get the stars star struck
You a one hit wonder who caught some hard luck
I'm that kid cats can't wait to scar up
But the show ain't over until the bottles is empty
Then girls run out the club, follow the Bently
Knowing that every president need a Lewinsky
Girls know I ain't know you but they try to convince me
And any chick that I'm with already know
You ain't gotta like Ma$e, but bet he blow
And anything that I do get heavy dough
Stop handcuffin' that girl and let her go
My whips got satellite, see it in the graphics
I ain't only got eight cuz I fly passed it
Why ask is Ma$e a classic
Knowin' I'm from the hood doing deals with Magic
Come on

Get ready, tonight
We're gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight
We're gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready, tonight
We're gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight

How 'my complain  na? 
When I'm as pretty as my father? 
And he got 60 hoes (60 hoes?) 
That know each other (yeah) 

Yo  I'm the problem nigga's got  but scared to step to it 
If a nigga really want it with me? Let's do it 
See cats in the club  it's just music 
Thieves and killers'll tell ya  I just proved it 
I set the tone  ya nigga's adjust to it 
Spit bars  nigga's do sets and rep's to it 
I'm the type that get 30 years and rep through it 
Want it wit' us? Come put your best to it 
Come clean now, I'll send these tests to it 
I should get a Nike contract the way I ""Just Do It"" 
You know I hide B's on it 
Come on B.S. and leave on it 
Get 50 grand and breathe on it 
Red dot, squeeze on it, drop keys on it 
Might hit a chicken and then put Cease on it 
Cats get greed in war with the heat of they jaw 
Somebody move wrong, I put they teeth on the floor 
If they don't show you where the coke at, beat 'em some more 
Make 'em see how it feel to have to eat through a straw 
While I'm sittin' in the car, chick goin' to get my jar 
So I greet them like the chicken they are 
Said Shorty, if you ever follow me and spit a clip in my car 
Tell ya now, that's like lynchin' the law 
Ain't no gettin' up if I hit you 
So all them cowards want to ride with you 
They either die with you, or lie cripple 
Mess with me, now why would you? 
Nigga's die dealin' with dough that's quadruple 
Double Up 

[Chorus: Mase & Flex] 
Where all my down super star's at? (Gettin' it) 
Where the cats at the barn at? (Gettin' it) 
Where the 90 girls that? (Gettin' it) 
Where the girls around the world at? (Gettin' it) 

Real hair, real furs (Gettin' it) 
Got a house that's hers (Gettin' it) 
For my niggas outta town at (Gettin' it) 
Can't forget my niggas locked down at 
(Gettin' it, uh huh) 

[Mase] 
Yo, it's like some be real, sold me three and squeal 
Some hold they head, some see appeal 
Some come home wild in the week to kill 
Then show old cats young cats be real 
Deep throat be how I greet my chick 
Any hoe suck a dick, got at least a six 
Any man call me fam', got at least a brick 
Shut the whole morgue down just for Easter kicks 
When I'm down and out and I need the chips 
Vietnam will be how I leave your script 
And it take dough just to reach the rich 
So can't no senator impeach my 
And don't rush to be somethin' that you're not 
Reworn up lies, keep guns cocked 
And any cat mess with us get one shot 
To do what he gotta do and get somethin' hot 
Blaque, back up, what what 
Blaque, back up, All Out 
(Where you at? Where you at?) 

[Chorus]

[Mase] 
Yo, please don't make Murda live out the name 
I'm only here to get enough, then I'm out the game 
A nigga didn't want drama, why he came? 
It's like tryin' to win, know you cross the grain 
Messin' with my niggas, ya'll will both get the same 
Cut 'cross the face, now you both look the same 
Still wanted for the bricks, took up in Maine 
Run up for ya chain, fifth cop aim 
Please don't be stupid, come out the chain 
Don't be a hero, this clip will bang 
A nigga like Mase probably got everything 
X-30 G's, then why buy a plane? 
No skinny Benz's, wide-bodied things 
Four dot, six dot, chick dot Range 
Uh, All Out (c'mon)

Yo who got the right to flip, twice the whips 
Time to get paid, get twice the chips
See law ain't no good unless two dice hit
Hate me even if I didn't ice my shit
Fuck niggas, make that money and lots of it
Sold four million and somebody got to love it
They want Mase for video, ain't in the budget 
I can't take a piss without a bitch tryin' to rub it
How could you know like this 
When it's because of me a nigga know what nice is
I was 60 I have flow-itis
I like my weed green and my hoe's dyke-ish 
You know you like this
Young kid'll live by goldie advice's
Pimp hoe's that come across so righteous

I vow, they never bring the city to shame 
I pulled up the prettiest things, the prettiest range
The prettiest cars, and the prettiest stars 
By far the prettiest Misses
I pull up in the prettiest sixes 
So by the time you get the six bitch, I have the seven
By the time you get the seven, I switch to the eight
When it time I get this cake, a bitch could wait
They know I could sell five so they ship me eight

Yo why I'mma envy the lives or envy the guys
Who be frontin' in the Six that's really a Five
You could see I still got it by the look in my eyes 
I'mma blue collar criminal, crook in disguise 
It don't matter if it rain, I got a pool inside
And a stretch range so at least 20 could ride
And I could tell fake platinum from a mile away
When I rap, yo' 150 thou' get paid
So until then nigga, I style away
Four point six swit' to the Cal' away
I'm gettin' honey, I ain't with the beefin' going on 
I look at nigga's cars, a lot a leasin' goin' on 
My heat get raised up, streets gets blazed up 
Until a nigga find my dough and pays up 
I lays up fuck, 'till my days up 
Doggy style, so bitch don't fuck my ways up

You know you make me cry
You make me cry, too
How can you love me
I can't understand why
I just wanna know why

Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry, too
How can you love me
I can't understand why
I just wanna know why

You think I wanna see you cryin'?
You think I want you when you need not one more doll
Then gettin' scared everytime you hear them sirens
Hear niggaz open fire and
Think your baby dead, front of a hydrant
But it's gon' to be a time when 
Ain't gon' be no more wineing
No more dining, no more diamonds
No reclining, no more expensive violins 
And I'mma probably be the one that's cryin'
According to my mother, if you wanna know if a girl love you
All you gotta do is make her suffer
Stop spending, stop givin' her the minks and linen
You will see if this girl gon' be with you to the ending
Cuz floatin' in the drop, it be all good
And when you come in on the block, it be all good 
Givin' her money to shop, it be all good
But when you get broke dead pop, is it all good, huh?

Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry, too

How can you love me

You know you startin' to act just like these bitches
Every fuckin' night with these bitches
Whatchu doin' fighting with these bitches
They like me for my riches, you like me for me
That's the reason I gave you keys to my V
See you be whipping my Benz
But you still wanna listen to your friends
And them gon' be the same bitches with me in the end
You look at your neck, what you see plenty of ice?
Then you think these hoes don't envy your life?
They wanna lay in Brazil, spend a day in the hills
It ain't hard to shop all day and pay the bills
Fuck the way you feel 
And keep it all real I wrote your name on my will 
And yo', that's real
You think a nigga cheatin' cause I don't be all in your ass
You think them your friends
I cut you off, all them'll laugh 
See my shit right there, put it all in the bag 
You ain't gotta say shit to me again, just call me a cab
I'm Out

You know you make me cry
You make me cry, too
How can you love me
I can't understand why
I just wanna know why

Now good thing I ain't a nigga who get way open
And fall for a chick that live way in Oakland
You pay for a trip, she lay up on an ocean
Then you find out this girl playin' with your emotions
I had this one chick turned out a dumb chick
Cause all she ever did for me was some dumb shit
But I could peep how mommy used to be foul
And everytime I hang up the phone she would redial
But it takes more for Mase to flip
I'm the first one to want out this relationship
Save that Jeep receipt, just in case you shit
You wanna fuck with my friends, take your pick, uh
You wanna do your thing, do your thing then
But don't be feignin' when you see me minglin'
Running up saying you love me and don't know the meanin'
When I walk away I could hear the girl screamin'

Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry, too
How can you love me
I can't understand why
I just wanna know why

Oh daddy

Uh  yeah  yeah 

Shit is crazy  yo 

(I feel you though  nigga) 

Who woulda ever thought  same nigga's 

It'd be them same nigga's 

(You are the same nigga  though) 

Same nigga that couldn't get the deal 

Now I'm the hottest nigga wit a deal 

(You ain't changed a bit) 



Yo  niggas never got nothin' good to say  quick to blame 

'Fore you judge me feel my pain 

You know it ain't a vest in the world that could shield my reign 

You ain't got money for the gas bitch, get out the range 

Got welcomed to the game wit' like 4 mil' and change 

Nigga's feelin' like I changed, but I'm feelin the same 

So who cares if they beg to differ 

When all them nigga's that beg to differ 

Is cokeheads and sniffers 

Take me for example, least I made it 

You think nigga's in the hood should appreciate it 

By time it's happy birthday its gon' be belated 

When you me, everything you do get exaggerated 

You miss a nigga pound they gon' say you flipped out 

Take a piss in the street they say you pulled your dick out 

As a youth it's just a lot of shit I want to live out 

Got a lot of friends but only had a few when I was without 

Same niggas I was starvin', couldn't get a crumb from 

Sometimes I think, where all these mother fuckers come from 

I needed money for school, couldn't get no ones from 

Got jumped in the park and couldn't get the guns from 

Instead of rollin' wit a clique, roll wit my sis 

Hell no, these motherfuckers can't hold my stick 

You think I care if they get mad? I don't owe them shit 

want to hold sumthin' hold my dick, nigga 



1 - We might be from a different hood 

But we the same nigga's 

(That's just the way it is) 

Don't be thinkin' shit all good 

It be them same nigga's 

Same nigga's get caught, blame niggas 

Same nigga's, go to court and name, nigga's 

(Some things will never change) 



It be them same nigga's 

Man, regardless how you feel 

(It's the way it is) 

It be the same motherfuckers that'll get you killed 

Them same nigga's, them same nigga's, them same nigga's 

Them same nigga's 

That's why I don't fuck wit niggas 



I got a brotha named Ant, right? Glad to be home 

Been through a lot of shit so I'm glad to be grown 

But yo', where were these freaks when I had no jeeps 

Livin on 34th street and we ain't have no heat 

'Cross from P.S. 92, 7th and 8th 

Asked you for dough and you said ""no"" dead in my face 

But now that I'm on, it's like I owe everybody somethin' 

All my niggas dead so everybody frontin' 

Same kid's went to Catholic school is dealers 

And same nigga's had no heart is now killers 

Sometimes I reminisce on what I said in the mist 

But even when I dream, it wasn't better than this 

But actually, the nigga's who would scrap for me 

Or go as far as getting guns and clap for me 

Ain't even here to get a platinum plaque for me 

I talk to them but they don't talk back to me 

I ain't know you that long so ain't much I can ask of you 

And when I reminisce I can't take it back wit' you 

I can't ask ""Yo' what happen to my nigga Black or Q?"" 

So I don't really need to rap wit you, ya know? 



Repeat 1 



Yo', I figured if we All Out, it's all right 

As long as when we all brawl we all fight 

I'm under nigga's hoses like roses 

Here I am, M A dolla-sign E nigga, fear no man 

Nigga hit me in the mouth and we bound to fight 

Just call my bluff and it be on tonight 

I got words of a madman tatooed on my arm 

Ain't fuckin wit my sister 'cause I'm mad at my mom 

Blink sayin', ""That ain't you wit a gat in your palm"" 

But Blink, it's either that or be harmed 

So the doctor give me pills for the wound, stitch my flesh 

Give a nigga last wish so he could pick his death 

So my sister want to rap and I wish her the best 

But I would never want to wish her my stress 

Cause it's like when I hurt, y'all laugh 

They put me on every forecast sayin' that I bought ass 

So I drink a tall glass before I spaz 

Then I take it like a man and let it all pass 

I wanted big bucks, no whammys, understand me 

I show nigga's love and nigga's underhand me 

Then they wonder why I want no family 

What I need a hooker for, gettin' head from 

And I fear when New Year's come, 'cause it might be the year 

A good nigga die 'cause when you good life ain't fair 

Like you call on the saints but the saints don't hear 

You could cry to the Lord, its like Christ don't hear 

So instead of hood winking I give you the plain facts 

If I never change, how I'm gon' change back, explain that 

They sayin' Mase ain't the same cat 

But every time you get robbed I get ya chain back 

Them same nigga's 

Them same nigga's 

Them same nigga's 

Them same nigga's 

That's why I don't fuck wit niggas 



It's crazy like that, you know what I'm saying? 

You'll be tellin' a nigga you got a deal 

He think that that shit come with Rollies 

And they come wit' Benz's 

Come with Bentleys and houses and shit 

They don't need no one to work, a nigga quitin'

A nigga that's speeding, bound to have a collision
Bound to be in prison, or bound to pop a mission
So if you got dogs, nigga, let 'em go
If a mob fuckin' truck right, let 'em know
We got the same guns that you got, but better though
And next time we in some shit nigga, you will know

And I stand over your head, like look at you now
And the kids in the parks start lookin' around

And who's my crew?  A chosen few that's how I do
So I could walk Harlem days, let it creep Harlem nights
Bum bitches givin' blows, parties and gunfights
Only right, I be the spark that will ignite
Explosions, MIC erosion, niggas is foldin'

Guess what, what?  It's really not too often
That I let loose like this, but fuck it
Here's a portion with no endorsement
Doin' what I gotta, to make it hotta

This is what I sound like after 5 years

Why do I feel like I still got the floor
(You back kid, Bad Boy for real, Let's go)

Verse 1:
Before '99 I was born again
5 years later I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's an oxy moron
Forget a bus, I brought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin' I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gonna make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up
Been a change of plan
Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin'
Help me lift the big man up (As we proceed...come on...yeah)

Chorus:
Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe, Stretch, Shake, let it go
Breathe, Stretch, Shake, let it go
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
(Betha I love this one...endeavor, for real, Bad Boy)
Breathe, Stretch, Shake, let it go
Breathe, Stretch, Shake, let it go

Verse 2:
Some days I make thousands
Some days I make millions
Spend my day chillin
Coupe's with suede ceilings
Everybody out there wanna know what Mase got
Way hot gray drop Maybach gray yacht (Whoooo)
And that's just the way it be
Favor, people wanna pay for me
When I'm in Mr. Chows, they waive the fee
And I don't chase money man
Money chase me
I give my wife things that she dream and more
I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)
I'm back like Moses to bring the law (Come on)
Brand new saint Mase in mean velour
I had bling before you ever seen the tour
Fans from Iran and Singapore
And grown men beg me to bring them on tour
Even if it mean they gotta sleep on the floor (Let's Go!!)

Verse 3:
I used to be the guy stood next to Diddy
Crucified for bringin sex in the city
Even though the girls think I'm extra pretty
How I know? I ain't got no extra wit me, oh
With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Ain't no if I...Know
I'm the man to plan the way
This ain't my life
I've become a saved (Say what)
Put up a good fight
Like its mandalay
Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God tI'me now, and I don't plan to play
I'm only here for the one thing you lack
And make dj's scratch is he is he back
Kids in the hood stutter it's a it's a fact
It's the kid resurrected it's a it's a wrap

Verse 1:
Before '99 I was born again
5 years later I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's an oxy moron
Forget a bus, I brought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin' I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gonna make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up
Been a change of plan
Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin'
Help me lift the big man up (As we proceed...come on...yeah)

Verse 2:
Some days I make thousands

Spend my day chillin

Everybody out there wanna know what Mase got
Way hot gray drop Maybach gray yacht (Whoooo)
And that's just the way it be
Favor, people wanna pay for me
When I'm in Mr. Chows, they waive the fee
And I don't chase money man
Money chase me
I give my wife things that she dream and more
I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)
I'm back like Moses to bring the law (Come on)
Brand new saint Mase in mean velour

Fans from Iran and Singapore
And grown men beg me to bring them on tour
Even if it mean they gotta sleep on the floor (Let's Go!!)

If it's your thing that ain't workin then you improvise
Why...it's me...you hate...that's genocide
Everytime I'm in a vibe it's me that they criticize
But everytime they in a ride it's my song they memorize
The richer get richer the poorer get poorer
See I'm here to save the city like Sodom and Gomorrah
Got a order I'm awaitin from a 404, my aura's not the Torah
Plus I'm jazzy like Norah
See my codi call me wodi, and don't even know me
I been around the world man without a roadie
See I'm classic like a Audi
Save the game like a goalie
Got my Rollie, olie, so you can call me holy rollie
You don't know what you're in for, don't do no endo
I'm not tintin' my windows
I'm not duckin' no bimbos

You got something to say, then send your memo

Back in '96 when I made ya move ya feet
The feelin's back so get up out your seat

Yea yea yea yea
Now it was this bounce, that opened up a Swiss account
If you get this, you guaranteed for this amount
Now can we pause for a minute, under the authentic
See I ain't said a word and you're already in it
See money is my linen, I get it as long as they print it
I tell ya that far, invest in Nascar
I leave the streets smokin' like brand new black tar
Girls...put stickeys everywhere my ass are
Silver horsey on the back, is this a fast car?
Yellow ice on Sunday, pink on a Monday
White ice, Six Flags, family on a fun day
Know much about a Hyundai, if you want to come stay
We kick it, beat ticket, make on a one-way
Now what they gon' say? I don't need it?
They don't really tell the truth, man they life was defeated
They quite conceited
They rockin' all that ice that's treated
I wrote a book about it, like to read it, huh, huh, huh, huh?

Hands in the sky, and put 'em high.) [2X]

[Ma$e]
Uh uh
Engine in the back, no roof-top
Feet on gas, with no need for cash, oo oo oooh
Trunk in the front, I make a million in a month like pumps in the bumps
You know Mason be that very fellow that bring canary yellow
Hand, so heavy, that it's hard to say hello
I'm somethin' you got to have like strawberry Jell-o
Same jewellery in the hood cause I ain't scared of the ghetto
You know it

Mase,"I don't regret nothing that I have ever done
At this point I don't owe nobody an explanation

Man, they love you when you up
Kick you when you down
Look around, VH1 man, where are they down
Life is amusing, nobody like to see you cruising
But everybody like to see you losing
So I stop despise, on top of lies
And if it prophesized I'll be ostracized
One day, I lost my rodium on the day I hit the podium
Now I'm back on top and salty like sodium
A gift to this world man, wrap me with a ribbon
Why do you look for a dead among the living
Some thought I was crazy, some thought I was dissing
Some said I was lazy, some said I was different
I was so loaded, that everybody floated
But once I got the notice then I got focused
And then I saw they motive, so everybody rode it
So I did the way wrote it and live it the way I quote it (come On)

Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
When I'm down at the back, just keep it real
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta Survive in this life that's being given to me
So I try and I try to be all I can be
When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
Gotta survive, gotta survive

Hold up, trying to tell me what I'm not
Pull up in the 'Bach, not I'm all of the sudden hot
Now they want to stop just to look at what I got
Thought they want my home man, left me out to rot
So I had to make it on my own, take it on my own
I wanted out the hood I had to 'scape it on my own
Believe me now, it's easy now
'Cause everybody see me now and I'm on TV now
But it started out with low budget
Then I took it around the world the folks love it
In the beginning man, my life it was so rugged
But now I shine like a gold nugget, cause I made the most of it
I know how you feeling man, I was weary
Some days I used to sit there, my eyes all teary
Thinking to myself, do anybody hear me
Now I know, you making it out is not a theory (come on)

Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
When I'm down at the back, just keep it real
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta Survive in this life that's being given to me
So I try and I try to be all I can be
When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
Gotta survive, gotta survive

I've been laughed at, talked about, ridiculed
But I got a Bentley and I'm still not a bitter dude
And you know it's not coincidence, that me and you is not so intimate
I can't fake, I don't shake, I don't break
I don't lose, I don't use, I don't groove
I never lacked and I'm never going back
I'm nothing you ever sawd of
I'm telling you that I'm immortal

Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
When I'm down at the back, just keep it real
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta Survive in this life that's being given to me
So I try and I try to be all I can be
When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
Gotta survive, gotta survive

Got to, got to survive
Keep your head held high
Got to, got to survive
Keep your head to the sky
Got to, got to survive
We can make it if we try
Got to, got to survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive

You know there is nothing in this world that could separate me
From what I believe, from what I've achieved
All of this is because of him
And I'm telling you now, as much as you all don't want to hear this
I could do nothing to myself
It's all through him 
It's all through him
So all around the world
You don't even know success until you know him
And him is Jesus, Jesus",Gotta Survive

They tried to bet it in my brain, and said it never change
Either win it in the anthem, they gon' say the name
Weren't the bentley or the phantom, you ain't said a thing man
It ain't wordy, plus it ain't dirty
Full time, Millionare, and ain't thirty
Anything out there, smooth and basic
Tennin' up, came from the school of mason
You know what's up, even my jewels await this
You would be a fool, to hate this
So came from the pool, of make this it's still the same floor
Wrist looking like a rainbow, and I know
It's better now, when you get rich, you want to settle down
Full speed ahead, we on the petal now
When it came man, you know I was never around
When the arm came, you know I was never found
What if I go, as you call, I can let 'em

Ya'll seen me fly, and ya'll seen me broked
Ya'll heard the beat, but I caught the flow
I seen the goal, when nobody want to know
You married now, what'chu mean, ooh ma ma
Really in mind I'm like, ooh nah nah
I got Millions, watchin' I can't go left
Cause if I do, then they go death
You know your man tyson, ain't been the same, since Indiana
Then coal being been the same, since Colorado

Me Myself from my heart, act to follow

No dro and Hennessey, I don't need the energy

Back in the industry, just to let this enessy
Mean in me, and they treat me like an enemy
Yes ya'll remember me, but now it's like tenemy
They clone me, it's like everybody owe me
Who had try to phone, but God already warm me
Feel alone, I feel like a old lead
All eyes on him, to tell me why they own me
I gotta eat, I gotta live, I gotta ride
I gotta teach, I gotta preach, I gotta tie
So I need my money, right, right now
The real thing in the world, is in my life right now

You know I neva had time for the he say she say,
Cats act breezay I put em on the 3-way,
Coupes be coming, looking like a relay,
Don't catch it now, get it on the replay,
I'm in my game with some kid named Enrique,
Don't pump weight, don't see the D.A., 
What you hear now, is definitely not a cliche,
Ball so much, I be sold on E-Bay,
People thinking how close the lova,
They hear what's great, and I know some otha,
Some 12 years old, they had a poster of him,
Kids cry you gon get em close to hug em,
And this right here is my retro flow,
The prince of the air got to let you all go,
5 guys arrive when I step to the floor,
Flannels out, push your button and open the door

And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put you hands in the air...

Now how did I get so popular,
The people watch you when you knock the laws,
Even when I'm eating at the lobster bar,
I come out, cops want to stop my car,
I move quick, I can't lolly-gag,
Jewels thick, it make my body drag,
I'm not just a star from the hood,
With money like this, it gotta be good,
Friends platonic, cars exotic,
You name it, you know I got it,
Flows so melodic, sort of hypnotic,
You ain't got to question, dude the kid got it,
Give me another topic, get low, rich low,
You can see this here from the 25th row,
VA to San Francisco, they married to this flow,
Keep the disco, popping like this go

A postcard, of the coast guard for the most part,
Paint my pictures as clear as Mozart's,
And these cats got no heart,
Oh my god, why I got the flow so hot,
I'm thinking now, of hot-hot foreva,
Crusing down on drop-drop whateva,
Cruising down the street on the drop-top carrera,
These cats here can't stop my chedda,
In my formal life there more chris than aguilera,

So I promised them I won't fly jets in bad weatha

When you need it, I'm gon' be there

ain't it funny how honeys now
Tryin to find love in the club
Good girl wit a thug and its makin me bug
They the ones who want to lose they life
And be wit somebody that'll do them right
Put yellow in they ear, put pink in they wrist
No worldly man would ever think of this
When I'm gone you'll make a wish
You'll dream all the days you could think of this
I only wanted to make sure that you had everything I got
Make sure that you had everything that's hot
Since I got it all you could even have
Mansion wit a lab put somethin in your bag
don't let me, be the one to hold you up
But go tell him, its over now the time is up
Now you know I got a message to the world
I ain't here to mess wit your girl you can relax

The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there
The love you need is already here

When you need it, I'm gon' be there (I tell you what, love don't act like that)
Why you want to look for love in all the wrong places

Mase,"[Mase]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get money, make money
Why's it always got to be about some money
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Cause I was born to have it
You satisfied

[Chorus: x2]
In my life, money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when it's movin' slow
I ain't afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes

[Verse 1: Mase]
See the charm is global, the ice on my arm is oval
Money stacked in the back like it's Barnes and Noble
I know a girl Colorado, half of mulatto
Said I was hollow till I bought her a Murado
Some call me Ma$e and some call me Doller
Some came to hate and some came to holler
Followed by a mode,l I ain't even cop a bottle
See me GP and I ain't even hit the throttle
Mansion not listed, why'all got me twisted
Only young boys shop at the district
I hop out of big things rocky wristed
Now everybody thinking I'm domestic
Uh, grown mine, I need to chrome mine
Why yall go lease, I need to own mine
I stay so fresh I need my own line
So if money involved I need a hundred for mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mase]
I know the pros and the cons to the smoking dons
See I'm laid in the shade to the Boca rotund
And people want to beat me with they open arms
But could it be my Rolls or my frozen arm
I'm like whoa man, mind I remember, I fear no man
Put chicks on the floor like a slow jam
With God on my side I fear no man, I'm deprogrammed
It's like I don't really care what another man think
Love to spend many so I understand
Money in the bank so I understand
Excuse me miss your standin' on my mink
My rock so big it jams up the sink
You can't call me sissy cause my whole hand pink
Enough ice in this to make a man blink
You think I care about what he think
Here we go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mase]
Now you be the middle man, I'ma be the money man
This flow right here, I know you don't understand
Power to get wealth, part of the covenant
I'm not your man, don't front me about your government
Why'all do it why yall way, I'ma do it God's way
Forget the house I put a million on the driveway
Clothes every spendin' winnin' dressed up in funny linen
Grinnin' while I spendin' givin' to men and women
Oh we back we cool we friends again
And we gonna get some lunch
Oh we back we cool we friends again
And you ain't seen me in sixty months
I know how you stunt, I'm hard to distort
You know my face so it's hard to resort
Garage, lookin' like a rob report
House, one hole away from a golf resort

[Chorus]",Money Comes and Goes
Mase,"Yea Yea Com on
Man I just do what the doers do
Com on Yea you heard it man
I just do what the doers do

Now I been makin' hits since under age
Contract intact can't be underpaid
This ain't a game I ain't come to play
Don't front for me I ain't from the A

Don't you want to hear what I come to say
This just the kid you know me from before
Prices go up when I come in the store
I'm in another island in the bungalow

The bee suit down to my underclothes
Ate like a cat that was undersold
I give, get it back in a hundred fo'
I'm feared like man that was from the ro'

And y'all now that I will bring you out
And when I'm talkin you don't know a thing about
Bring Modenas out take a scenic route
Bettin' against me is bound to clean you out

[Chorus]
This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop top cars and suvs
G5 flights and shoppin' sprees
This is where you want to be
This is la familia

It's hard to get low in the 3-6-0 spider
License plate all the chicks know
Cats walk around buffed up like a beach guys
But they don't put no fear in these eyes

Beside I'm just here to teach lives
Girl walk around and try to give me the slide
The ice on my arm it gave me all away
I rolled up the tent top up and rolled away

I smell like money lit though the state
Go in my closet first to throw away 
I'm never lost I already know the way
If I need it 'fore tonight I get it 'fore today

I'm God made I took 5 years part laid
Home pool arcade and it's all paid
What's save I spent a third on an upgrade
Then bought palm trees 'cause I ain't have enough shade

[Chorus]

And when the record plays
What will the haters say
Oh don't you be afraid 'cause I'm your allaby
So when I'm drivin' by

Don't try to analyze
Because a him I'm a still be fly
And this a lullaby

Come on now
You know my flow I'm in and out
Non-guilty I ain't gotta buy the trout
Couple a critics but I ain't gonna stop now

I got a plane to catch to be in Moscow
I'm on jets they doin' sky mouths
So I see why the people so hostile
There's now drama it's more honor

I'm wanted in the world like I was Osama
This is no exaggeration
Why's these people so mad and Mase and uh

The watch that I'm wearing right now
Made in Genneiva, wavey low ceaser, navy four seater
Girls is snobby, money is my hobby
Cats want to rob me, coupes is wide bodied
So I'm like mami, move down a seat
Next thing I know, hat blew down the street
Never knew we could have life like this
So much dough, it'll put your life at risk

Rolling in a brand new Bently G.T
And besides, it's my pictures, I'm saved and I'm rich
Sitll the fly chicks see Mel my sidekick

Used to want, now they need us
Everything in the club want to please us
Now I'm on T.V., more than Regis
We juss do it with a big budget
Like 9-1-1 wit the rubbish
I ain't got to go in the club to be discovered
Might not know what a thug is, but I know what love is
Love ain't weak, love ain't deep
And love wanna see you more than once a week
And love ain't cheap, love don't creap
Love ain't a freak, and love don't want to run the streets
And this is how we operate
Love is the oppisite of hate
And love is no demand
So you need to understand
It won't take your man
Its just a comand

And all the pretty chicks all want to smile at me
These rap cats man they all got they style from me
And if I ever seen them then they probably bow to me
And when this beat - drop I know they gon' lean

Girls from brunettes down to blonde queens
These young boys don't know what a don mean
I'm just a bad boy gone clean
I'm the diamond chain choker, always remain sober
Don't drink liquor and all the games over
Need a plane, I explain it to my broker
Three bots in the hood top down, it ain't nova (My homie)

Everyday approached by chicks when I was on top
want to give me sosa, but I'm like don't try
I see the hisses and the disses when I go by
But see the misses on my wristses when I float by
Self control, and I can't tell you no lie
Tryin' to find a soulmate, you end up being so tired
I make my money man without the coca
Livin' the vida without the loca
I'm down south so they show me country love
And I ain't even country thug
The people give me daps and hugs, so it must be love
And I love the country grub
It feel good to hear people singing welcome back
And I ain't even sellin' the track, cause I'm that Harlem cat

Masi,"Out in the street it's six am, another sleepless night
Three cups of coffee, but I can't clear my head from what went down last night
No we won't have our own little ways, but somehow we keep it together
You hear me talk, if you don't hear what I say, I guess it don't even matter

Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way
Blue morning, can't you see, what your love has done to me

I've always listened to your point of view, my ways are cut through men
And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye
You say you might send a letter
Well honey don't telephone, 'cause I won't be alone
I need someone to make me feel better

Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way
Blue morning, can't you see, what your love has done to me

Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way

Maska,"Comme toi je me contiens et j’attends qu'le vin se remplisse
Mes idéaux s’empirent
Mais tant pis c'est la vie, j'ai pas le choix d'avancer
Sur une lame aussi fine, que celle de leur pensées
Tu m'a fait parler d'amour, mais c'était pour m'étouffer
Hein, un jour tout se sait
J'ai de l'amour j'ai de la haine, mais qui en vaut la peine
Un ami qui va te trair, pour un boule qui pue la merde
J'veux revenir dans l'Dîn, là où les gens sont dignes
Mais la courte durée de ma vie, n'est qu'un mensonge qui m'attire
J'ai de la peine pour les Antilles, le soleil nous a menti
Ils nous donnent le cancer en nous disant je vous embellis
Des journalistes sans peur, ils se nourrissent du malheur
Leurs voix ne tremblent plus en parlant de morts tous les quarts d'heure
La terreur paralyse, mais la peur te motive
Notre fierté aura raison, bien qu'elle soit toujours fautive
L'espèce humaine est plus dangereuse pour la terre que son magma
J'suis qu'un pêcheur dans sa lave qui vient, perdre son appât
Est ce-que tu percute ça va pas, je m'étouffe, dans des draps de soie
Mon cœur, perd de sa valeur, le diable, me dis sa va de soi
Je suis peiné quand je vois ma foi, diminuer sous le poids du rap
Qui me fait kiffer sur l'instant mais me tue façon durable
Je fait un art triste je suis un artiste qui écrit des textes avec l’arthrite
Y'aura que lorsqu'on sera partie qu'il y aura quelqu'un devant ma clique
Persuadé que le mal m'habite, refais surface en cas de panique
Y'a pas de kiff quand y'a pas de risque mais qu’est ce qu'on kiffe être à l'abri
On aime ceux qui nous abîment, le bon son au dessous de ma team
La France me paraît pas radine mais en scred dépouille les sous de l'Afrique
Demande des sous pour le tsunami en fait ce sont des sous-nazis
En un tour de magie, l'alcool me soulage vite
Il nettoie les blessures, mais pas celles de mon cœur
C'est dans tous les sens du terme que l'alcool devient trompeur
Ok tu sors de taule c'est plus la mode des bombers
Mais celle des boules bombés qui ont mis leur coeur dans un bunker
Mon existence n'a pas de sens, mon cerveau n'a pas de raison
Je suis perdu comme un fou je pense m'être enfermé dans ma maison
J'apprécie ma souffrance car je sais qu'elle partira pas
Je m'en plaint pas je relativise l'ingratitude salira pas
Ma reconnaissance, des tonnes de vices akhi c'est pas ça que je vise
Ma fragilité me brise
Ton boule est comme le soleil, il m'aveugle j'ai besoin de lui
Me réchauffe trouve mon sommeil, quand je l'regarde, il me nuit
Assoiffé en Somalie c'est dur de pisser de rire
On cherche a jouir de la vie pendant qu'il essaient de vivre
C'est vrai que le respect se tire en même temps que le temps passe
Leurs discours sont vide de sens pourtant leur conneries s'entassent
Si t'as une femme bien, prends soin de cette perle rare
Chercher ailleurs ne mène nulle part
Ça kalash par intérêt ça se bute pour rien pour un terrain
T'obtiens le respect tu crois que t'es frais, t'es prêt à tout pourtant t'es rien
J'ai délaissé l'salât pour embrasser trop de ?
Je peux pas posséder ma life s'il te plaît Barack aide moi
Ne me laisse pas mener ma barque, tu connaît le blanc est barge
Rappelle moi que je suis Souleymane tu sais j'ai pas de mémoire
Son absence me fait du mal mon père est parti trop tôt
Je le rejoins dans sa tombe akhi y a pas de quiproquo
Je suis comme quasimodo à force de porter ma douleur
Mais j'ai le sourire à tout heure
J'en veux au gens quand je vais mal pourtant c'est eux qui me font du bien
J'ai un défaut ancestral, il m'ont dit que je descend du singe
Chaque fois je m'attache à une femme qui me tend ses seins plutôt que ses mains
J'y vois plus clair dans les flammes mais mon âme cramée s'y éteint
Quand l'homme ne veut plus se taire il laisse parler les guns
Pour réparer ce monde est ce qu'on doit casser des gueules
Rester en place dans le rap c'est comme s’euthanasier
On l'aime pas mais on reste là c'est comme cet état raciste
Oui tu m'aimeras d'avantage le jour où je vendrai moins de disques
Matter en l'air fait mal au cou, tu me préfère avec moins de fric
Parfois je me regarde et je me dit, ferme ta bouche qu'est ce que tu parles
La vie s'est hardcore comme une daronne qui fait du hard
Satisfaire l'homme c'est comme, Dieu-donné sans polémique
Ou rassasier un boulimique qu'est ce qu'on ne ferait pas pour le fric
Un texte un peu sensé comme celui que je viens de faire
Certes y a de l'émotion mais qui te dit que je suis sincère?
Vas y savoures mon son, l'espace-temps dans ta tête
Ce monde n'est qu'un mensonge intemporel te le rappelle",Espace-temps
Maska,"J'implose, face aux épreuves comment me contenir
J'implose, les miens me soulagent, ces liens me font tenir
J'implose, ce n'est qu'une question de persévérance
Patienter serrer les dents, eh eh
J'implose plutôt que m'enterrer vivant, je m'interdis d'en finir

Celle qu'a prit ton cœur a perdu beaucoup plus
L'amour a un goût d'merde mélangé à de la rancune
A force de prendre sur moi je peux même plus prendre de recul
J'canalise mes nerfs comme un pieux entre deux putes
J'sens que j'en peux plus mes pensées s'entre-tuent
Die, sans que j'fume, j'ai marché sans rotule
La Musique m’a appris de près le sens de flûte
Mais j'ai le cœur en paix, jamais je change de pute
Accoudé sur un traître qui chuchote ""Qu'est-ce t'espères""
Comment retrouver ses principes on sait que le respect se perd
Viens pas test', est-ce que c'est clair, car je resterais ferme
(Chut) Laisse les se taire j'resterai fier

J'implose plutôt que m'enterrer vivant, je m'interdis d'en finir

J'encaisse depuis toujours comme ce gamin qui se prend des baffes
A par la vie marqué des SI comme le visage d'une tapin à temps?
La lâcheté me tape en partant, c'est pas convainquant
Bats toi, parle comme un homme et pas comme un gosse
J'implose, souffrir en scred, sourire au lèvres
Peu importe j'cours à ma perte, j'oublie mes rêves
J'prends sur moi comme un obèse bourré de graisse
J'vis pas d'amour et d'eau fraîche j'suis entouré de braises
J'suis pas à plaindre poto, y a toujours pire que soit
J'ai toujours plein d'potos, qui m'rendent visite le soir
Akhi y a pas photo, les flashs noircissent mon cœur
Mais t'inquiète pas j'implose mon sourire est trompeur

J'implose, face aux épreuves comment me contenir
J'implose, les miens me soulagent, ces liens me font tenir
J'implose, ce n'est qu'une question de persévérance
Patienter serrer les dents, Eh Eh
J'implose plutôt que m'enterrer vivant, je m'interdis d'en finir

A force de chercher l'or, je vais finir par me perdre
Ceux qui parlent sur moi vont finir par se taire
Je suis pas dans la merde je suis dans les affaires
Beaucoup de soucis à gérer me prend pas la tête
Appelle moi Léonidas j'suis prêt pour la guerre
Vodka et son sont dans mes artères
Trop de galères sur le dos triple hernie discale
Le combat c'est vital, tout ne va pas si mal

J'implose, face aux épreuves comment me contenir
J'implose, les miens me soulagent, ces liens me font tenir

Quand j'reçois de sales nouvelles, j'parle même plus j'secoue la tête
Wesh les frères, stoppez la taule, ces allers-retours depuis seize piges
Faut la vie qu'nos mères nous donnent, faut les rendre fières car elles s'épuisent
Quand j'rêvais du succès, j'pensais franchement que c'était plus beau
Paraît que j'étais un mec en or même si dans c'temps j'étais plus pauvre
L'amitié coûte-t-elle si cher? 
J'sais pas, j'sais plus
J'ai perdu tous mes repères vu qu'même les lâches m'éduquent
Pour mes gars braves comme ce cher M'baye, ma mère s'rappelle de ce que t'as ais-f
Pour mon frère, c'est rien pour toi, pour être un homme, suffit d'un geste
Mais l'quartier faut délaisser, on peut plus traîner comme avant
Ça fait même pas d'argent, t'es dans les ténèbres dans la blanche

Vous vous faites du mal mais pour la came vous n'vous quittez pas
Je t'ai vu gratter tes veines, au fond ça m'bousillait grave

Cette ville en toc vend des mirages qui peuvent te blanchir du cirage
T'es nerveux, c'est inné, t'as un cœur pur, j'le sais

Depuis j'attends avant d'sourire qu'une nouvelle vienne pas m'attrister

Tu rigolais, tu pleurais, sans un sou, ton cœur s'ouvrait
A n'importe qui, y compris tes assassins!
Ces hommes, ces chiens, ces lâches qui t'ont tabassée à vingt
Ça a transformé ? de voir David partir
Injustement j'suis juste témoin du mal quand l'quartier chavire
Ceux qu'on aime sont en nous, quand ils partent, ça rend fou
Aidez-moi, retenez-moi, j'suis faible et j'pars en couilles!
Quand l'diable, vêtu d'une robe, t'enlèvera ton pote
Tu comprendras qu'une belle femme peut faire du mal avec ses formes
Manger l'cerveau avec ça chie, l'image est gore
Mais tellement vraie, j'ferai plus d'efforts 
pour mettre mes potes face à leurs torts
J'ai déjà les miens qui rangent mon corps

Si on crache par terre c'est qu'on maudit la rue 
aussi vieille qu'elle est elle est trop immature
On a patienté dans la rue, sans blé, star dans la street à côté d'mon gars Gims
Tous ces putains d'artistes ne savent pas chanter, tu l'as pas en feat tu devras sampler
On va péter l'million sans marchander, ouais c'est c'qu'on disait dans nos assemblées
On attend dans la hess on marche en bande, on arrache ton portable faut décamper

Le H de guerre enterre cette lettre, j'veux te voir en paix épanoui dans ta vie
À tous mes frères, s'te plaît (teh?) on sait que le shit est un sale antalgique
La street est dure, elle n'a pas d'cœur, stérile et glaciale comme l'Antarctique

J'étais prêt à tout pour te plaire
T'as fait de ma vie un enfer
J'étais prêt à tout pour te plaire
T'as brisé mon cœur à long terme
J'étais prêt à tout, oui, j'étais prêt à mourir

C'est l'histoire d'un monstre qui avait un drôle d'appétit
Il avait déjà mangé les habitants de sa ville
Il parcourait la terre pour continuer à se nourrir
Pour satisfaire son ventre, beaucoup trop de gens vont souffrir
Après plusieurs années, il traverse la mer en bateau
Son voyage sera sanguinaire, il a la colère dans la peau
Difficile de négocier, monsieur ne tolère pas grand chose
Il débarque sur une terre, les habitants sont en applause

Les habitants l’accueillent, le nourrissent en souriant
Mais ils ne connaissent pas le monstre, faudrait qu'ils soient plus méfiant
Ils peuvent pas l'apaiser, sa cruauté est en lui
Il commence par dévorer les plus jeunes, les plus gentils
Rien qu'il mange et grandit, la liste des morts s’empile
Le sang ne fait que couler, la terre est rouge et sans vie
Pas de bateau pour s'enfuir, oui les habitants endurent
Il se nourrit de leur souffrance il apprécie leur sang pur

Après 400 ans de torture le monstre a rempli son ventre
Plus rien à manger, faudrait qu'il rentre dans son antre
Les habitants sont en transe, mais ne possèdent que des lances
La peau du monstre est immense, et sa haine trop intense
Il repart satisfait d'avoir détruit un continent
Il a laissé derrière lui de vastes ruines en s’empiffrant
Sans compassion, sans sentiment, comment cette bête se sent si grande?

J'maille en jouant comme un joueur de foot

Gros single c'est possible que j'ai grossi mes points SACEM
J'ai choisis d’être dans l'fossé

Avec envie mais crainte de trouver le dass dans son étreinte
Les mystères du destin
Ma vie d'merde est restreinte
Insatisfait d'un festin
Ma joie de vivre s'est éteinte
Critique-moi ça m'rend humain
Insulte-moi je deviendrais chien
Je suis nécessaire et surprenant comme la longueur des intestins
Moins t'es dans l'underground
Plus y a d'taupes c'est bizarre
Dans la nature c'est le contraire
Est-ce que tu captes si j'dis ça?
La musique m'a amené dans un puits d'ténèbres
En m'faisait croire qu'y'avait de l'eau
Mais y avait qu'des rêves
Méfie-toi des pigeons, c'est parfois eux qui t'chient dessus
Leur merde te tombe dessus peu importe où tu t'situes
J'parlais pas des oiseaux les animaux nous nuisent pas
Nos verres de Whisky s'cassent
Eux s'contentent du Whiskas
J'attends que la justice fasse
Son travail sans petite crasse
Le juge ouvre ton casier comme si il ouvrait une pistache
On étudie pour faire des armes à croire qu'apprendre c'est dangereux
Le hasard va t'faire du mal si t'es trop tenté dans le jeu
Bsahtek si tu portes la rue
Moi j'la supportes t'as vu
Elle te tue gratuitement peu importe ta thune
Belek la personnalité d'un mec que personne a niqué
Un président d'un mètre soixante à qui les gens sont agrippés

Tu reconnais pas tes torts, c'est dingue
T'as la mort aux bout de tes doigts comme un fonce-dé qui sort ses flingues
À force de raconter de la merde
Tu pues de la gueule
Il cherche la merde celui qui s'approche
Du cul de ta sœur
On se dit à c't'heure d'une vie de vices
Il serait peut-être temps qu'tu captes
Qu'il n'existe pas de petites crises
Y'a trop de banques qui craquent
On aime la maille plus que tout
On a toujours plus de goût
On cherche qu'un seul amour et pourtant toujours plus de boules
Rien que j'gratte ma feuille, à croire qu'elle a de l’eczéma
Normal Vincent veut dire vainqueur, on m'compare à Benzema
Tu veux pas arrêter de ler-par
Ferme ta gueule j'vais tout leur dire
Les rappeurs ne pensent qu'au cash
Pour ça qu'on noircit nos pages
Vous tenez nos cœurs en otage
Aujourd'hui j'vais tout sortir
On nourrit des fantasmes en sachant qu'ils vous torpillent
On bombarde, on écrase ceux qui veulent nous ralentir
J'ai l'talent pire stop ta rage, j'rappe sale 'faut pas mentir
J'ai de l'argent mais j'suis perdu
J'suis comme un roi qui n'a pas d'empire

J'entends tes cris retentir
Si tu tombes love de la street
Tu vas embrasser son sol
Pourtant tu sais qu'c'est qu'une actrice
Qui t'faire rater ton vol
Vers une vie épanouissante
Loin des sanglantes descentes
J'ai du mal à faire confiance à mes ententes récentes
Les sirènes sont tant stressantes
N'en ont en plus après les marins
Mais les gamins
Qui ont des parents que la banque étrangle
Faut que j'devienne une légende
J'en ai marre d'attendre les gens
Une peluche ne ressent rien
En paraissant attendrissante
La France est belle mais complexée
Comme une reine devenue esclave
Et si les petits n'ont plus de respects, est-ce que les grands sont respectables ?
T'effaces pas un adultère en même qu't'effaces un texto

C'est pas qu'on se la raconte, c'est qu'il faut célébrer les choses
Parmi ceux qui ont trouvé l'or nombreux d'entre eux se cherchent encore
On va pas te pleurer longtemps après que tes potes enterrent ton corps
Ton père t'entend insulter sa fille, marre de voir que tu perds ton temps
À force il a compris, ça sert à rien de t'faire comprendre
Les démons sur mon âme doivent faire un boulot colossal
Tu t'crois frais quand t'es dans le son, tu t'laves avec de l'eau sale
J'attends le soleil pour sourire, il fait encore un temps maussade
Faut qu'je change, j'deviens futile vu tout l'argent que j'claque en sapes
Donne de l'importance aux gens, c'est comme ça qu'on t'en accorde
Quand tu t'mets au-dessus des autres, t'étonne pas qu'on t'tende la corde
Quand t'as les chevilles qui gonflent, bah forcément tu marches plus droit
J'commence à faire des zigzags, ça craint grave amputez-moi
Ceux qu'on aime sont en nous
Quand ils partent, ça rend fou
Aidez-moi, retenez-moi, j'suis faible et j'pars en couille
Leurs valeurs, leur vieil humour, tout ça me pompe les nerfs
Rappelle-leur que le cadavre se dégrade même si la tombe est nette
C'est en t'passant de la pommade en douce qu'on t'pénètre
Tu t'fais niquer comme tout le monde pourquoi t'as honte, c'est bête
En France pas de vice président, le notre en a déjà trop
Les petits restent impolis, parlent mal, draguent ta go
Drive-by, pas d'magot
Y'a que le matelas de la taule
Pour amortir ta chute qui écrase les tiens par ta faute
L'argent te donne du pouvoir
Tout en t'affaiblissant
T'as l'impression de décoller
Tout en atterrissant
Petit ce monde n'est pas prospère si tu souhaites rouler en grosse caisse
Tu veux mettre tout le monde d'accord
T'as pas le choix mon frère, faut se taire
On doit accepter la mort de ceux qu'on aime par amour
La conscience a des contraintes que l'homme endure chaque jour
Ouais il boit car ça l'saoule, il est saoul car il boit
Se dissoude de tous ses frères pour deux trois sous assieds-toi
J'ai pas fini de te tatouer mes idées dans ton veau-cer
Elles sont noires et malsaines
Et donnent naissance à mes cernes
Seuls les cons trouvent les gens cons
Et comprennent pas qu'on est tous pareils
Tous parés paros tarés
Tout s'paye tôt ou tard
Et Marine Le Pen va vite se perdre dans sa vallée de vice de merde
On utilise pas la haine pour créer une vie de rêves
On connait l'prix de tout, mais la valeur de rien
Et le bonheur des autres crée toujours le malheur des uns
Les orgueilleux égoïstes tomberont jamais amoureux
Tu t'aimes trop pour en aimer une autre, allez avoue-le
Une fois mort beaucoup de bâtards parleront mal de toi
Personne n'encaisse mes vérités c'est pour ça qu'j'rappe le soir
Ceux qui parlent derrière mon dos sont bien placés pour que j'leur chie dessus
Ça évitera les prises de tête, les ""J'vous déteste"" et ainsi de suite

Si j'dis tout ce qui m'a blessé bah j'ai bien peur que vos cœurs se perforent
Un frère dans la coke et c'est moi qui fait des nuits blanches
J’appréhende l'année suivante, la vie est flippante
Ceux qui parlent derrière mon dos sont biens placés pour que je leur chie dessus
Dites aux médias de bien réfléchir avant de vouloir nous tirer dessus
Car on s'est relevé plus fort
Le mal qu'ils nous ont fait est resté dans mon corps
Quant à ceux qui me critiquais car j'étais le seul blanc du groupe
Dieu merci j'suis plus ouvert que vos cœurs fourbes
J'oublierais pas toutes ces bavures, humiliations de keufs ingrats
Plaqué sur l'sol, baggy baissé, ça ma fierté s'en souviendra
On m'a mis le ventre ouvert, ça a serré mon coeur

Paris by night à la recherche des acheteurs
C'est pas pour trouver l'âme sœur qu'on met nos pieds en after
J'passe en débat différé si j'ai pas d'alibi
Quand j'vais en Belgique, j'me dirige pas vers Walibi
J'ai jamais rien compris aux maths, t'as vu
Donc j'me r'trouve à faire des ronds à tous les angles de rues
Des récits fantastiques, des statistiques statiques
On veut d'venir obèse mais l'État sert d'anneau gastrique
Quand j'voulais qu'on m'tende la patte, y avait pas un chat
On d'vait graille dans la même assiette mais t'en as fait ton plat
Perce, tu vis un cauch' quand tu rêves
Les gens te gonflent en espérant qu'tu crèves si un jour tu perces
Haa, tu sens la rage quand j'parle
Chez nous c'est soit les putes soit les keufs qui palpent
C'est la même combine qu'on deal ou vende des compils
Retourne dans tes comptes, pines pour éviter qu'on t'pille
Ils veulent savoir si j'possède des biens d'grosse valeur
J'me demande avec quelle arme j'vais affronter l'fossoyeur
10 ans plus tard j'suis toujours l'même putain d'gosse râleur
J'tourne en radio sans qu'tu m'entendes, j'suis un ghost rideur
J'étais mineur émancipé par des cas d'force majeur
17 ans en taule, sorti avec une force d'ailleurs
J'ai la dalle, j'suis en chien, j'ai le mort d'ailleurs
C'est c'qui a faillit nous faire braquer ces convoyeurs
On était con voyons, loin d'être visionnaires
On voulait juste baiser la rue en missionnaire
On voulait s'déplumer, pour des prises de bec
Ça jouait les gros bras aux premières prises de pecs
Soit t'étais sur l'terrain soit t'étais mis sur l'tec'
On savait exiler tous les fils de traîtres
Les fils de traîtres ou les fils de lâches
Ont baignés dans leur sang et ont pris le large
M'dépasser pour mes gars, bâtard, j'ai l'art d'le faire
J'prendrai la vie de celui qui veut enterrer mon H de guerre
Rappelle toi de nos cambriolages en l'an 2000
12 ans plus tard en cellule on s'tape des barres de rire
J'connais Paris de fond en comble, ses côtés les plus sombres
Tu dois noircir ton cœur pour briller dans la pénombre
J'ai volé, j'ai racketté, j'ai fait du mal à autrui
La rue m'a instruit, mais la rue m'a détruit
J'ai tabassé des gravons, j'avoue j'ai boxé des javons
J'me suis aussi mangé des K.O., bouche ouverte sur l'carreau
J'ai fait ma salat mais j'ai plus souvent commis des pêchés
La question, est-ce que ton gars Abou va s'faire repêcher?
Haa bref, assez, laisse le passé au passé
Mon gars Maska m'appelle, ce soir y a du gibier à chasser
On s'capte à 9h pétante, j'suis pas d'ceux qu'ils prétendent
J'sors de taule, j'tire un coup juste histoire d'me détendre
Peu importe la filière, j'veux pas toucher une misère

I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong

But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you

I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Then disappeared

I asked her
Do you know what that was
And did it shine for only us?
Tell me do you know what that was

I remember climbing up those shoulders
Coming up under you like a lion
Coming down like we were dying dear God
But now the drum birds come for me

Oh now the drum birds come for me

Forgive me now of the weight I bear
Don't keep me on the run dear God, dear god

Before it tore my chest apart

I tossed and turned, I prayed for it to stop
I scratched my face an' tore my sheets

And in its place these bird wings beat

Of happiness and daily things

I know true love don't love like anybody else
I know your heart don't beat like anybody else
When it all comes down to kerosene
And sorry signs on cash machines
And it don't look like anything you've dreamed of

I won't let you give it up
With sorry sighs and forced bad luck
Come on baby, you know what we're made of
I know true love don't love like anybody else
I know your heart don't beat like anybody else
And all these burning battlefields are now behind us
Life has brought us here together to remind us
That love will rise above it all and just keep growing
Life keeps flowing, and every moment starts right here with us
I know true love don't love like anybody else
I know your heart don't beat like anybody else",Sorry Signs on Cash Machines
Mason Jennings,"October morning, little plane on the forest floor
Up on the TV between a rerun and another war
Here in a hotel, trying to make some sense of this
Two thousand miles from my family in Minneapolis

Hey Senator, I wanna say
All the things you fought for did not die here today
Hey Senator, I'm gonna do
All the things I can to live my life more like you lived

A story of a love undivided for thirty nine years
Strong when it counted through the hard times and the fears
Together forever, that was always what it was about
No hesitation, there was never any doubt

Hey, hey, Sheila, I want to say
All the things you fought for did not die here today
Hey, hey, Sheila, I'm gonna do
All the things I can to live my life more like you lived

Hey Senator, I wanna say
All the things you fought for did not die here today
Hey, hey, Sheila, I'm gonna do
All the things I can to live my life more like you lived

Mason Jennings,"I took the train up from Illinois I was followin' threw on a letter you sent
always feared that you'd be true, true to yourself to the better end. 
Just kinda happened, or so she said, she was drinkin and lonely and you know the rest. 
And he meant nothing, he was havin a stand he said she loves me still and was a second chance

[Chorus]
I don't want to be together, I don't want to be apart, 
I don't want of this love for ya honey deep deep down in my heart. 

Where's my golden crown that you took and passed around, 
There's no telling what a man might do with a life like this when it all falls threw 

[Chorus]

You were my dream come true, can't you see what you put me threw? 
The love that tears me apart still beats deep deep down in my heart, deep deep down in my heart",Crown
Mason Jennings,"After all this useless fighting, after all our schemes
We could sense a final battle and started picking teams
Due to lack of good direction, I fell in with thieves
And took to drinking as religion and landed on my knees

Truth that starts as understanding finds you in the night
The circles all around the ceiling, a frightened bird in flight
After spending hours beneath it, everything comes clear
Truth will pose no danger to you, what haunts you both is fear

Somewhere in our ever after telephones still ring
Somewhere in our future journals, love still means something
I have learned a mighty lesson from this change of plans
Loss is brutal, I can't stand it, I wonder how you can

And all the while there's dogs barking
Streets are talking out my window
Out the light and the snow is flaking, hearts are breaking
Words are making a mess out of these thoughts I'm thinking
Boats keep sinking, it's drown or keep drinking

And if this darkness came from light
Then light can come from darkness, I guess
If this darkness came from light
Then light can come from darkness, I guess
",Drinking as Religion
Mason Jennings,"All day, everyday
I swing my hammer to the metal
On the Northern railway
Always a movie playing in my head
A million movies starring you and me

Moonshine every night
Eating supper by the fire, out in the clear moonlight
Ankles crossed, hands behind my head
Telling stories, singing songs about the West

I'm always thinking of you
Staring off down the railroad line
One sweet day I will see you
But I'll swing the hammer until
The empire builder brings me home

For two months and two odd weeks
Sometimes days go by in which nobody speaks
From Illinois to Washington
There ain't nothing but the hammer to the rail

One day when this track runs through
I'm gonna buy a new suit and come looking for you
And carefree, you and me
We'll take the empire builder to the sea

And I'm always thinking of you
Staring off down the railroad line
One sweet day I will see you
But I'll swing the hammer until
The empire builder brings me home
",Empire Builder
Mason Jennings,"There you said it, it slipped out
Now it's out there and I'm filled with doubt
Please say something to let me back in
What are you saying, what are you saying?

This conversation is a mountainside
It's a long way down and there's no place to hide
When we started up it didn't look this high
What are you saying, what are you saying?

My hands are sweating on the counter top
I'm looking at you and I, I can't stop
Looking for something that was just right here
What are you saying, what are you saying?

Stuck in a dream, is it the only one
Forever ending, never done
We're still talking but it's a memory
What are you saying, what are you saying?

Fourteen pictures on the freezer door
Fourteen pictures and there'll be no more
Little magnets hold up a family
What are you saying, what are you saying?

I'm sleeping, I'm dreaming , I'm ten feet tall
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming you up against the wall
Louder, louder then silently
What are you saying, what are you saying to me?

Mason Jennings,"It was bound to happen and it happened today
Life turned to us to say, ""I'm about to go your way""
And it's a simple situation now that we became us
There ain't no rust on the happiness bus

And it's Wednesday, Thursday, my day, Friday
Saturday, Sunday, all the rest are fun days
From now on until the very end
Never gonna spend another day without you again

Here's the proof, I'm telling the truth

It's a big fat love we feel in our hearts
We're keepin' it, keepin' it, keepin' it real

Now the sun is going down over our troubled times
We can free our minds and leave it all behind
And it's a common stipulation that there ain't no hope
But there's a tire swing baby on the end of our rope

Where the summer breeze
Blows through the windows in the afternoon
And all the stars come out at night

And there's a boat out on the sea
And there's a bird up in my tree
And there's a feeling in my heart

Mason Jennings,"I woke up at 4:35, still jet lagged from another plane ride
And opened my window over Bondi beach
Where all the stars seemed out of reach
And recognized none but the southern cross

Sitting on my bed with the light turned off
Till I found a sweet song on the little clock radio and it made me cry
Singing have some faith, have some faith
And I don't know what I want but I know where I want to be

And everywhere I go, I wish you were here with me
Stars hang on tiny strings, my dreams are made of memories
Once everything made sense, now I get so alone that I can't sleep
Will somebody please tell me if this is where I'm supposed to be

Bottles on the table and socks on the floor
Trying to remember what I started this for
When a surfer friend of mine came and picked me up
And we paddled out as the sun was coming up

Talking about how everybody has to find
Something that gives them the strength to be alive
And out laying on our boards in the southern hemisphere, he said to me
Gotta have some faith, have some faith

And I don't know what I want but I know where I want to be
And everywhere I go, I wish you were here with me
Stars hang on tiny strings, my dreams are made of memories
Once everything made sense, now I get so alone that I can't sleep

Mother well led me to believe all my questions would be answered
Now I have it here, sitting on the table
Another word for the universe

Loose green tea and a bonsai tree, underground apartment
Check my email and wash my clothes while my rice is cooking
Oh Jesus Christ how I hate making phone calls
So I lead a lonely life

A waterfall from a higher place told me all about you
The funeral of the man I was told not to doubt you
Oh what we could do with your dress up round your shoulders
We could leave all our fears behind

Mason Jennings,"On the train ride to Paris
Or from sunny Barcelona
We rose up through the mountains
As the sun started setting

And the sea came out below us
As we rode through a village
We passed ten feet from a little porch
Where a man was serving dinner

And our window was open
And we could hear them laughing

I'm never gonna give you up
What do you got if you ain't got love?
If you ain't got love
What do you got if you ain't got love?

At nine in the morning
After nine months of waiting
You were born and I saw your face
And you looked up at me

But before I could hold you
The doctors raced you from me
They told me that you might not live
Your heart was not healthy

And with wires coming from you
I sat beside you

I'm never gonna give you up
What do you got if you ain't got love?
If you ain't got love
What do you got if you ain't got love?

Someday, someday soon
You and I will both be gone
And lately, I can't help but think
That the love we feel will live on

At a little wooden cabin
Up in northern Minnesota
We ran together down to the dock
And you jumped right off it

And from out in the water
You called me to join you
And I said, ""Baby, I cannot swim
If I jump, I'll surely drown you""

You said, ""Life has no limit
If you're not afraid to get in it""
And oh, baby, I jumped to you
Since then there's nothing I can't do

I'm never gonna give you up
What do you got if you ain't got love?

In the cab I grabbed my phone

And made a call I might regret

Mason Jennings,"Dust cloud coming off an old dirt road
That leads up here to this little graveyard
Seven lights in a perfect row
Under each light is a police car

Just because you say it doesn't make it true
You can say that I'm guilty man I just don't care
You can burn my body black
Just don't make me go back to Jackson Square

I met you on Decatur Street
With your little bare feet and your violin
I was walking by with my guitar in my hand
You smiled at me and I jumped right in

Before I knew it you were all I knew
Every moment together was an answered prayer
After a while we had some money saved up
And we rented a room over Jackson Square

Then one day everything changed
Your eyes got strange, you didn't seem yourself
You'd go to tell a story and you'd start out fine
Halfway through it you'd be somewhere else

And I started having the strangest dream
I held a string and looked up in the air
And you were glowing with the strangest light
Drifting out of sight over Jackson Square

Life is something that you can't control
When you try to hold onto it, it makes you let go
Things are not like they were before
I can hear her crying through the bathroom door

She says, she hears spirits all around the room
And they're telling her things that make her feel scared
I have no idea what to do
Before we're in over our heads in Jackson Square

I woke up with a weight on my chest
People were screaming on the street below
I reached for you, I was alone in the bed
Wind was blowing through an open window

Suddenly I was very old
In a little boat, absolutely nowhere
Staring at the side of the universe
And your tiny body down on Jackson Square

Now don't tell me that there ain't no end
There damn well is and it waits in the wings
I see you kneeling there at center stage
In your tiny cage made of angel wings

While I'm here every night
Loading my gun and trying not to go there
Anyone who says that life is clear
Has never seen a mirror or been to Jackson Square

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mason Jennings,"Jesus, are you real?
Did we make you up?
Is salvation what you want
Or is faith enough?

Do you know where I'm bound?
Do you know who I am?
Are you just a word I use
When I don't understand?

Standing like a statue in the sea
In a little truck stop in Tennessee
And bombs are crashing down in waves
On a giant TV screen

And I am struck
I cannot move to make it stop
What can I do? People are dying in their beds
While this flag flies over our heads

Jesus, are you stronger than a loaded gun?
I'm beginning to believe you're not the only one
Strong enough to show your love, strong enough to give
Strong enough to go through hell, strong enough to live

And all night long I sat with you
In a darkened hospital room
And nurses checked in by the hour
I was made aware of a higher power

And how this fragile life we live
Is not ours to keep but ours to give
What in the world am I gonna do
If anything should happen to you?

All I do is doubt you, God
All is do is love you, God
All I do is question you
What else can I do?

This world was never solid ground
The past is coming back around
All I do is search for you
What else can I do?

And when I say I search for you
I mean I search for peace
I search for hope, I search for love
And one day for release

Jesus, my life does not feel the same
New things happen everyday, things I can't explain
But I am not a man of faith, I'm a man of truth
But is this feeling in my heart, is this feeling proof?

When you do not know, you know
And when you know, you do not know
And when you think you do, you die
And when you do not think, you grow

Are we left here in the dark
Or are we left here in the light?
It seems to me that both are true
And it?s up to us to know what's right

All I do is doubt you, God
All is do is love you, God
All I do is question you
What else can I do?

This world was never solid ground
Religion cannot help me now
All I do is search for you
What else can I do?

And when I say I search for you
I mean I search for peace
I search for hope, I search for love
And one day for release

That I just cannot know
And even when I lose control
I will not let you go

Mason Jennings,"When I got off the bus it was six in the evening
Snow was blowing across the intersection
For the last six hours I've been lost in a book
So it took me a second to remember what I was doing

Standing in the middle of a bustling sidewalk
Under barren branches silhouetted by street lamps
I reached into my overcoat pocket
And brought out a letter with your address on it

And I may be dreaming but I've come to you
I have nowhere else to run
How you gonna say what's never been said?
I'll tell you how it's done

You just look into your eyes
You look into your eyes
And follow 'em down, you gotta follow 'em down
Till the streets are lined with trees

On the last block there's a little blue house
It's the only house I see
And up in the window a light still shines

Your daddy showed you what was wrong with life
I wanna show you how to make it right
Hey, hey baby, I'm in your city

Who was I and what had bound me?

I was the one who ended up our history
Well, it looks like you wrote the last page to me
Your friends say you've got a new man

These were supposed to be my carefree single days
Instead I'm punching walls and coming up with ways
Ways to win you back from your new man

Told ya keep it frozen, it caught fire instead
Have you not heard a single word I've said?
No, you were busy loving your new man

Goodness garage, his name is probably Rog
He probably drives a truck and his hands are probably big
I bet he fixes things around your place when they break
If he says he likes your cooking he's a fake

Girl, please say, he doesn't tuck his shirts in, please
Please say, he doesn't wear a gold chain, please

I have seen it here inside me and that light is what was found

Come home, come home sweetheart
Come home bitter heart
Let go and love

Are your broken, are you beaten, are you stranded in your head
Has your path made you a stranger
Does that stranger want you dead

Mason Jennings,"What good is remembering
When the thought of you tears at the seams of every dream that I've built since then
It could be anything
Could be standing on a corner in China and somebody will say your name
I thought I was stronger than that
When I was young older people would reminisce I'd say no that's not me
That's not me, its you, it's always been, your ghost just will not rest
Walking the horizon line in my favorite summer dress

Do you remember when I broke your clutch and you threw both your shoes at me
Talking your brother into buying us wine cause we didn't have any ID
What was so rough, was it the freedom that freaked us out
Now nobody's free
and there's so much we could do without
we could live in a dream, live in a dream, live in a dream
Live in a dream

What good is remembering
Got me standing on the present moment like an island in an endless sea
We can only go sailing out
Drawing circles in circles but there's no safe harbor out there for me
I thought I was smarter than that
Thought that I could live two lives at once while other suckers they just lived one
What's the moment in your life that you just would not trade
If you had a time machine would you go back there today

Do you remember when you kissed me so hard that you chipped both of my front teeth
Counting our cigarettes and spacing them out trying to make them last the whole week
What was so rough, was it the freedom that freaked us out
Now nobody's free
And there's so much we could do with out
We could live in a dream
Baby we could work it out, we could live in a dream
Maybe we could work it out
We could live in a dream, live in a dream, live in a dream

Throwing rocks 'til your light comes on, comes on, come on
Silhouette by the open blind, clocks are ticking stolen time

We should make a flag baby
Cause the place that we are standing is a country all our own

You need a beacon of hope and I want to be it

I recognize ya in an instant from a rollin' distance
Walking out into a grove of trees
And the love that I feel is just overwhelmin'
Spring flower by a singing stream
And the secret to the thing is let nothing dived us
One boat in an open sea,
It's just you and me and our hearts to guide us

Mason Jennings,"I was standing by the village gates when I first heard the news
The king had sent his men to seize Gabriel's land
And when Gabriel he refused, the men took both his daughters
And cut the wedding ring fingers from their hands
The next three days I heard three times separate similar stories
The king was taking what was ours for his own
Deep, deep down in the pit of my chest my fear turned to fury
When I thought about my family and my home

Good kind Rudy stood before the king
His mighty sword in his hand
All through the valley we could hear him swing
And a joyful cheer filled the land
Nobody's ever gonna treat us like that again
Late that night all the men in the village
gathered in a clearing in the forest
And we elected Good Rudy to lead us now

He decided right away that the king must die
Every head bent forward as he told us how
We split up into two large groups
and headed for the castle on the hill
My group stormed the front, all the guards came running

Rudy's group snuck up from the back and laid
their ladders up against the castle walls
Nobody ever saw them coming

Good kind Rudy stood before the king
His mighty sword in his hand
All through the valley we could hear him swing
And a joyful cheer filled the land

Mason Jennings,"I drink a bottle everyday then step on the stage
I first knew something was wrong when I was half my age
One night while I was singing, I started to laugh,
I couldn't stop laughing for a week and a half

I'll never forget the girl in the first row,
She said, ""But its not funny""
I said, ""I know""

So I went to a shrink and he said to me,
""Just don't drink when you're nervous,
That's the key""
And I said, ""Okay, that sounds fine""
I didn't tell him I was nervous all the time

So I kept on drinking,
And I kept on thinking

Wake up, you're dying now
You should be dead,
But you're not somehow
You think you're being brave,
But you're digging a grave
You talk like a master,
But you live like a slave

I started meditating, that worked for a while
I spent a lot of time alone,
And I forgot how to smile
I went to church, I'd just sit there and stew
Thinking, ""How can all these people believe things that aren't true""

It seems to work well for them, why can't I?
I guess it's 'cause I'm special
'Cause I'm too smart a guy
Too smart

Wake up, you're dying now
You should be dead,
But you're not somehow
You think you're being brave,
But you're digging a grave
You talk like a master,
But you live like a slave

I decided that I couldn't do it alone
I called a guy I know on a telephone
I told him all I ever wanted was to be perfect
I sure as hell don't wanna be an alcoholic

Acceptance is a doorway to hell,
If you're on the wrong side,
Things don't go so well
So I accepted who I am, and named my disease,
And finally felt relief, and got down on my knees

Wake up, you're living now
You've been gone so long, do you remember how?
Just be yourself, that's being brave
You're not the master,
But you sure ain't the slave
You're not the master,

Where the clouds meet the mountains in an endless dream
Come little rider let your dress fall back
Into the hours of abandon where the sky turns black
Up in the morning with the sound of wolves
Got me running on the bottom of your empty pools

With my mind on your waist under your lilac gown
While light comes streaming from your open mouth
Hand in the beauty, got a foot in the grave
Got a feeling for the future that can only be brave
Wedding bells ringing and a fearless fall

I dreamed I saw a mighty room
And the room was filled with men
And the paper they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the papers was all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads

And grateful pray'rs were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
And guns and swords and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

Mason Proffit,"As I rode into Tombstone on my horse, his name was Mack
I saw what I'll relate to you, going on behind my back
It seems the folks were up-in-arms, a man now had to die
For believing things that didn't fit, the laws they'd set aside
The mans name was ""I'm a Freak"". the best that could see
He was the executioner, a hangman just like me
I geuss he'd seen loopholes from working with his rope
He'd hung the wrong man many times, so now he turned to hope
He talked to all the people from his scaffold in the square
He told them of the things he found, but they didn't seem to care
He said the laws were obsolete, a change they should demand
But the people only walked away, he couldn't understand
The marshals name was ""Uncle Sam"", he said he'd right this wrong
He'd make the hangman shut his mouth, if it took him all day long
He finally arrested Freak, and then he sent for me
To hang a fellow hangman, from a fellow hangmans tree
It didn't take them long to try him in their court of law
He was guilty then of ""Thinking"", a crime much worse than all
They sentenced him to die, so his seed of thought can't spread
And infect the little children, that's what the law had said
So the hangin' day came 'round, and he walked up to the noose
I pulled the lever, but before he fell I cut him lose
They called it a conspiracy, and that I had to die
So to close our mouths and kill our minds, they hung us side-by-side

And now we're two hangmen, hangin' from a tree
That don't bother me, at all
Two hangmen, hangin' from a tree 
That don't bother me, at all

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

nasconderò il dolore come non ho fatto mai 
ma non mi dire adesso che ti dovrei capire

ti giuro d'ora in poi non so più chi sei 
trascina via con te le tue incertezze e la tua ipocrisia 
ma il male che mi fai non puoi portarlo via 

Diventerà un scudo con il quale mi difenderò da te 
e adesso sbatti forte quella porta via da me...

e questo che ti vede andare via, non mi rimane che un saluto 
abbasserò la testa e così sia...

Massimo Faraò,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song

Quando sopra il viso c'è una ruga che non c'era 
Provi a ragionare fai l'indifferente 
Fino a che ti accorgi che non sei servito a niente 
E vorresti urlare 
Soffocare il cielo 
Sbattere la testa mille volte contro il muro 
Respirare forte il suo cuscino 
Dire è tutta colpa del destino 
Se non ti ho vicino

Che raccoglie i cocci di una vita immaginaria 
Pensi che domani è un giorno nuovo

Intro:

Weisst do noch Beirut?
Ich kam ohne ein Cent in meiner Tasche nach Berlin!
Ohne ein Cent! Kannste dich erinnern?
Ja man haha, wie könnt? ich das vergessen?!

(Part 1):

Ich kam nach Berlin, ich hab bei Beirut geschlafen
Man ich war nie ein Rapper hab nur ?n Gabelstapler gefahren
Doch dann kam alles anders ich verschickte hunderte von Demotapes
Keiner wollt mich haben ausser MC Basstard wollt mich sehen
Und dort saß ich nun, und trank ?nen grünen Tee
Und fragte Basstard wie es nun um meine Zukunft steht
Do musst das Rappen üben, man also tat ich das
Ich nahm Block und Stift in meine Hand und schrieb dann Tag und Nacht
Ich nahm dann kurz danach ?nen Song hinter dem Kotti auf
Woroc kann?s bestätigen ich lebte förmlich für den Traum
Schon nach dem zweiten Song, ich nannte es ?Das Ghettolied?
Wurde mir klar dass ich den Sound mach den die Strasse liebt
Hab meine Eltern mitgebracht doch erst den Song verteilt
Keiner hat daran geglaubt dass er beim Major unterschreibt
Das war mein eigner Hype, ich hab ihn selbst kreiert
Doch seit Ashraf kenne spür ich wie der Weg nach oben führt

Refrain (2x):

Wir gehen auf?s Ganze wir wollen alles oder nichts
Das hier ist unsre letzte Chance es geht um alles oder nichts
Wir schuften all die Jahre hart, doch ich hab das Glück vermisst
Komm arbeit weiter Junge, bis do glücklich bist

(Part 2):

Ich hab?s satt, dass meine Eltern sich beschweren
Ich hab?s satt nein ich will kein Job-Center mehr
Ich hab?s satt Hartz IV zu kassieren
Ich hab?s satt meine Freiheit zu riskieren
Ich hab?s satt zu hören dass aus mir sowieso nichts wird
Der 20 Jährige der wird von Al?Massiva präsentiert
Ich hab die Scheisse satt, ich will nach oben Junge
Ich atme ein, ich pump den Sauerstoff in meine Lunge
Ich hab es satt diese tausend Gerüchte zu hören
Ich hab es satt dass sich die Lehrer über mich beschweren
Ich hab es satt dass all die Rapper nur noch Lügen erzählen
Ich hab es satt ohne ein Cent in meiner Tasche zu leben
Ich hab es satt zu hören dass ich kein Berliner wär?
Denn als Nichtberliner macht man dir das Leben schwer
Ich seh das positiv, ich bin nur ?n Berliner mehr
Ich bin dieser Wahlberliner, ich bin der berliner Bär

Refrain (2x):

Wir gehen auf?s Ganze wir wollen alles oder nichts
Das hier ist unsre letzte Chance es geht um alles oder nichts
Wir schuften all die Jahre hart, doch ich hab das Glück vermisst
Komm arbeit weiter Junge, bis do glücklich bist

(Part 3):

Ich geh auf?s Ganze ich will alles oder nichts
Ich teil dein Schädel auf Beton wenn do den Gangster unterbrichst
Ich bin gesignt, guck M-A-S hat das Talent entdeckt
Do behauptest Rap sei dein Geschäft doch es ist mein Geschäft
Sein Geschäft, das ist unser Leben, unser Traum
Ich weiss genau ich steiger mich und das mit Gänsehaut
Al?Massiva jeder wollt? uns in den Dreck ziehen
Ich nutze mein Talent und ihr geht unter so wie Maxfield
Graue Wolken denn I'm Ghetto gibt?s kein Sonnenschein
Die Bullen haben nur ?n Job wegen meinem Freundeskreis
Rechne mit dem Schlimmsten, meine Zeit ist angebrochen
Ihr kommt angekrochen mich kann nicht mal ein Tsunami stoppen
Stop! Wir sitzen alle auf ?n Schuldenberg
Jeder macht, jeder rennt dem gleichen Cent hinterher
Wir machen Hits für Hits doch ihr Hunde fördert nicht
Guck ich förder mich, ich bin der Junge der befördert ist

Refrain (2x):

Intro:

Ich verdamme den Tag an dem ich dich kennengelernt hab?
Und sogar die Person die dich mir vorgestellt hat

(Part 1):

Die Träne läuft an meiner Wange entlang
Ich wisch die Träne weg und hau mit meiner Faust an die Wand
Kannst do dich erinnern? Wir waren jung und hatten keine Sorgen!
Hab dir vertraut do bist eingeschlafen auf der Couch
Ich hab dich zugedeckt, do hast bei mir gegessen
Hattest ?n Platz in meinem Herz wie kannst do das vergessen?
Ich hab dir Geld geborgt, hab dir ?n Job besorgt
Ja das war Bruderliebe ich gab dir mein Ehrenwort
Ich hab dir oft verziehen, do hast öfters Scheiss? gebaut
Hab dich als Mensch geschätzt und dir mein Leben anvertraut
Man wir kenn? uns schon damals aus dem Kindergarten
Wegen dein Schulden musst ich hunderttausend Leute schlagen
Jetzt hab ich tausend Fragen, und keine Antwort drauf
Ich war doch da für dich doch do hast dir zu viel erlaubt
Wenn do Probleme hattest wo hast do dich ausgeheult?
Do warst viel mehr als nur ein guter Freund!

Refrain (2x):

Blutsbruder ich will dich nie wieder sehen
Bitte verschwind aus meinem Leben
Sogar wenn do vor mir niederkniest
Mit deiner ganzen Heuchlerei würd? ich dir nie wieder verzeihen

(Part 2):

Jetzt sitz ich I'm Gericht und traue meinen Augen kaum
Ja es tut weh es kommt mir vor wie in ?nem schlimmen Traum
Ich kann?s mir nicht erklären, wie konnt? ich dir vertrauen?
Hast mich verraten man jetzt sitz ich hier do lachst mich aus!
Hast mich zutiefst verletzt, wo bleibt deine Ehre bloß?
Guck mein eigner Vater liebte dich wie seinen eignen Sohn!
Ich hätt? für dich die Hand ins Feuer gelegt
Man ich kann das einfach nicht verstehen
Do Verräter sagst jetzt gegen deinen Bruder aus?
Do warst I'm Knast ich hab für deine Mutter eingekauft!
Nur für dich hab ich den besten Anwalt finanziert
Ich bin so krass enttäuscht, man was soll die Scheisse hier?
Ich hab das nicht verdient, ich war doch gut zu dir
Jetzt bin ich eingefercht in einem Raum wegen dir
Dass der Teufel verführerische Gesichter hat
Sieht man an dir man ich habe dein Gesicht so satt

Refrain (2x):

Blutsbruder ich will dich nie wieder sehen
Bitte verschwind aus meinem Leben
Sogar wenn do vor mir niederkniest
Mit deiner ganzen Heuchlerei würd? ich dir nie wieder verzeihen

(Part 3):

Verleugne nicht dass do ?ne trügerische Ratte bist
Ich hör von Leuten dass do aufgestylt auf Parties bist
Verspürst do keine Reue? Man hast do kein Stil?
Ich verspüre, ein übergrosses Hassgefühl
Hast mir geschworen dass do den Ehrencodex beibehälst
Do gibst mich auf, ich versteh do willst ans grosse Geld
Wenn do Probleme hattest wo hast do dich ausgeheult?
Do warst viel mehr als nur ein guter Freund!

Refrain (2x):

Blutsbruder ich will dich nie wieder sehen
Bitte verschwind aus meinem Leben
Sogar wenn do vor mir niederkniest
Mit deiner ganzen Heuchlerei würd? ich dir nie wieder verzeihen

Wir sind alle gleich, wir sind alle vereint
Wir leben hier zusammen sind von Sorgen befreit
Hier hungert keiner hier wird ehrlich jedes Bisschen geteilt
Hier ist die Hautfarbe egal hier zählt dein Herz und deine Freundlichkeit
Ehrlich gesagt musst do überhaupt kein Deutscher sein
Guck wie leben hier hier wo nur die Sonne scheint
Die deutsche Tugend, keiner konnt uns bisher stoppen
Und wenn Deutschland spielt sind wir voll verschwitzt und hoffen
Denn das ist unser Land hier ist keiner dem andern fremd
Hier herrscht Gleichberechtigung hier wählst do den der dir gefällt
Es ist ?ne Frau die das ganze Land hier präsentiert
Jede Frau wird hier geschätzt, jede Frau hat Rechte hier
Hier siehst do Mädchen mit ?nem Kopftuch in die Schule gehen
Hier ist es schön weil sich ?n Moslem mit ?n Christ versteht
Egal ob Moslem, Deutscher, Türke wird sind alle gleich
In einem Land wo man sich ehrenvoll die Hände reicht

Refrain (2x):

Hier hält Einigkeit, jeder hat sein Recht hier
Freiheit! Das ist das Land dass uns zum Glück führt
Deutschland! Wir sind alle vereint
Egal ob arm oder reich, schwarz oder weiss

(Part 2):

Ich bin hier geboren, bin in Deutschland aufgewachsen
Hab ?n deutschen Pass ich wurde in der gründen Pfalz erwachsen
Hier triffst do dich als Kind zum spielen auf dem Spielplatz
Hier bekommst do Fördergelder wenn do einen Traum hast
Jeder wird hier aufgeklärt, jeder wird hier unterstützt
Jeder wird hier gut beraten, jeder findet hier sein Glück
Na klar gibt?s Sachen wo so manchen Menschen runterdrückt
Hier und dort gibt?s arme Leute mit viel Schulden I'm Genick
Die nicht viel besitzen doch man fühlt dass sie zufrieden sind
Genau hier spürst do den frischen Wind
In diesem Lied beschreib ich euch das positive Leben
Denn das negative Lästern tut schon in den Ohren weh
1989 sahen wir den Mauerfall
Freudentränen fliessen, diese Bilder sah man überall
Die Umarmungen, diese Erleichterung
Jeder trug die Fahne voller Stolz und hatte nur ?n Wunsch

Refrain (2x):

Hier hält Einigkeit, jeder hat sein Recht hier
Freiheit! Das ist das Land dass uns zum Glück führt
Deutschland! Wir sind alle vereint
Egal ob arm oder reich, schwarz oder weiss

(Part 3):

Unser Land liegt I'm Herzen Europas
Hier sagst do grüss Gott zu ?nem freundlichen Opa
Wo sonst gibt es Tauben wie am Kudamm?
Hier kannste Lufthansa fliegen oder I.C.E. fahren
Hier siehste Tannenbäume nicht nur I'm Dezember
Früher noch I'm Trabbi heute siehst do sie I'm Benz fahren
Egal ob Russe, Türke, Deutscher wir sind alle gleich
In einem Land wo man sich ehrenvoll die Hände reicht

It?s Mario Winans, and Massiv
It?s like a dream?

(Part 1,Massiv):

Hand auf?s Herz das war Liebe auf den ersten Blick
Ich wusste nicht dass man durch Sehnsucht solche krassen Schmerzen kriegt
Würd? dir gern beweisen das mein Herz allein nur dir gehört
Wär? ich taub geboren dann würd? ich dich mein Engel flüsstern hören
Nur für dich! Würd? ich mein Leben lang I'm Regen stehen
Glaub mir nur für dich würd? ich mich barfuss durch die Scherben quälen
Ich schenk dir Ehrlichkeit, Vertrauen und Geborgenheit
Den sanften Klang der Liebe kannste hören wenn do dein Leben teilst
Ich war nie der Typ der viel Gefühle zeigt
Doch die Angst dich zu verlieren zerbricht mein Herz in 100.000 Einzelteile
Guck ich wein?, während ich dir diese Zeilen schreib?
Und hoff? das hält bis in die Ewigkeit
Ich war der Typ der dort I'm Regen stand
Hey Engel kannst do dich erinnern do bist einfach in den Bus gegangen?!
Also stand ich dort am Strassenrand
Doch mein Herz war längst bei dir I'm Bus und fuhr mit dir die Strassen lang

Refrain,Mario Winans:

This is like a dream to me
The beauty in your face I see
And all I wish is that you?ll be
The woman next to me

And I will cherish every day
I?ll show you love in every way
Baby this is meant to be
And it?s like a dream to me

(Part 2,Massiv):

Wie ?ne Prinzessin setz? ich dich auf den Thron
Ich werd? dich mit den frisch geschnittenen Rosen morgens belohnen
Fahren mit ?ner Kutsche über ?n Schausollisee
Selbst wenn wir auf dem Lande picknicken sorg? ich dafür dass Kerzen da stehen
Ich deck dich zu wenn do dich schlafen legst
Hey do kannst dich kuschelnd an mich lehnen und mich mit in deinen Traum mitnehmen
Guck ich verehre dich und man do bist so zuckersüss
Ich begehre dich, ich bin kein Mann der seine Frau betrügt
Ich hetze jeden Tag mit dir als ob?s der letzte wär?
Hier steht ?n Mann der seine Frau verehrt
Ich umarm dich wenn der Regen fällt
Ich beschütz? dich unter ?m Schirm von dieser oberflächlich kalten Welt
Ich weiss genau als ich dich das erste mal sah
Sie hat mich nicht beachtet doch sie merkte dass es mich traf
Seit jenem Tag zog mich die Liebe in ihren Bann
Denn mein Herz war längst bei ihr I'm Bus und fuhr mit ihr die Strassen lang

Refrain,Mario Winans:

This is like a dream to me
The beauty in your face I see
And all I wish is that you?ll be
The woman next to me

And I will cherish every day
I?ll show you love in every way
Baby this is meant to be
And it?s like a dream to me

(Part 3,Masiv):

Selbst wenn do bei mir bist vermiss ich dich
Wenn do nicht in meiner Nähe bist, zerfrisst es mich innerlich
Ich glaub nicht daran dass das ?n Märchen ist
Das hier ist das wahre Leben doch ich hoff? do siehst mich als dein Märchenprinz
Ich hoff? do fährst nie wieder mit dem Bus an mir vorbei
Denn dann steh ich wieder ganz allein
Dort I'm Regen wo ich öfters stand
Wo das Regenwasser fliesst und das ganze Laub mit dir vom Strassenrand

Refrain,Mario Winans:

This is like a dream to me
The beauty in your face I see
And all I wish is that you?ll be
The woman next to me

And I will cherish every day
I?ll show you love in every way
Baby this is meant to be
And it?s like a dream to me

Meine Fans sind alle Menschen so wie ich und do,
Ich bin ich und auf Gangster brauch ich nicht zu tun,(nein)
Ich bin der Hero aus der Arbeiterklasse
Ihr legt euch den Text zurecht für die breite Masse
Frag doch am Schulhof wer den Kindern Hoffnung gibt
Seh den Krieg nur I'm TV doch er nimmt mich trotzdem mit
Glaub mir Al Massiva ist eine Bewegung
Wir sprengen euer Buiseness jetzt keine Bewegung
Denn das Volk es brauchte eine Stimme
Sie lieben mich,weil ich aus dem Bauch heraus beginne
Mein Fleisch ist euer Fleisch mein Blut ist euer Blut
Ich sag nur Gott sei Dank denn es geht mir heute gut
Keine Angst es ist alles machbar denn I'm Prinzip sind wir alle Nachbarn
Meine Feinde strengt euch an wie ihr wollt
M.A.S.S. I.V. ist der Mann aus dem Volk

Man erzählt es wird einer aus dem Volk kommen
Viele ändern sich wenn erst der Erfolg kommt
Bruder so nimmt dieses Leben seinen Lauf
Ja ich stehe für dich auf ja ich hebe meine Faust
Schwester hör wir müssen was erreichen
Meine Leute voller Ehre küssen unser Zeichen
I'm Schweiß gebadet um mehr zu bewegen
Ja wir gehen den harten Weg durch Hagel oder Regen
Ihr erzählt dem Volk was es muss
Doch hier draußen stehen wir mit Stolz in der Brust
Unser Schicksaal entscheiden ein Paar Ego?s
Ist das hier ein Rapkonzert oder eine Demo
Mit mir können sich so viele identifizieren
Ganz einfach weil ich nur ein Mensch bin so wie ihr
Wir kommen auf euch wie ein Panzer gerollt
Jeder weiß wer ich bin dieser Mann aus dem Volk

Die Leute sagen es wird einer aus dem Volk kommen

Wenn es euch nicht passt stellt dir einen andern ein
Doch bei uns stellt man sich auf den andern ein
Die Ära wird angeführt,
Man schenkt dir dieses Vertrauen,denn ich habe eher die Hand dafür
Ich versprech ich bleib hier für euch man
Schaut eure Kollegen an wir sind Deutschland
Hab ich auch nichts oder langsam schon Gold
Ich bin dieser eine, der Mann aus dem Volk

Menschen würden alles tun für ihr Land
Wir atmen Smog ein, ihr steckt ganze Wälder in Brand
Kleine Kinder sind von all den schlimmen Seuchen erkrankt
Menschen fliehen in Scharren und haben vor ?m Bürgerkrieg Angst
Präsidentschaftswahlen werden einfach manipuliert
Do fährst ?n Auto und denkst nicht daran was oben passiert
Ganze Eisflächen schmelzen einfach so vor sich hin
Ganze Arten sterben aus wir wissen nicht mehr wohin
Zur Erinnerung bleibt uns meistens nur dieses Bild
Dieses eine Bild das Leuten zeigt wie schön sie doch sind
Unsre Gier nach Geld, und der Ölpreis bestimmt
Wieviel Blut muss dort noch fliessen sind wir stuhr oder blind?
Eure Spendengelder fliessen doch ich frag mich wohin
All unsre Herzen sind betäubt denn nur das Schicksal bestimmt
Hörst do die Sinfonie? Sie hat ?n unglaublich schönen Klang!
Es ist ein Herzschlag der entscheidet um uns alle man

Warum seht ihr?s nicht, die Welt geht zu Grunde
Schau dich um, es zählt jede Sekunde
Warum seht ihr?s nicht, die Welt geht zu Grunde

Es legt sich schwarzer Teer bei Rauchern in der Lunge ab
Neugeborene Babies legt man in der Babyklappe ab
Nachts werden die Kinder wach schon wieder mal ?n Ehekrach
Das Kinderheim erzieht doch Kinder landen eher in Jugendhaft
Spürst do wie dein Puls rast?
Ich bin einer dieser Jungs den erst neulig eine Kugel traf
Menschenrechtsorganisationen wollen gutes tun
Verteilen Medikamente und fördern deinen Schulbesuch
Keiner der Geschlechten Gott benutzt eure Verhütungsmittel
Waisenkinder, die selbst nach tagelangen Hunger bitten
Auf dem Boden kriechend betteln sie für ?n Schluck Wasser
Man kann förmlich ihre Rippen zählen ja dein Wille zählt
Kommt und überschüttet diesen unfruchtbaren Boden
Mit Getreidekernen, Pellkartoffeln, Kaffee oder Bohnen
Ja ich steh für Frieden, ich bin einer dieser Boten
Man euch blendet schon ?nen Centstück ihr seid einfach schlecht erzogen

All die jungen Soldaten die nicht den Krieg überstehen
Wir sind wie Blüten an den Bäumen die den Sturm nicht überstehen
Guck sie hat sich in das Ehebett zum schlafen gelegt
Doch ihre grosse Liebe ist bereits I'm Sarg unterwegs
Selbst Therapeuten schlucken Anti-Depressiva-Tabletten
Guck all die Kids sind hyperaktiv und würden gern? rappen
Ach die Armut ist verbreitet es ist düster und grell
Sie pusten Kerzen aus wir werden in den Schatten gedrängt
Manchmal denk ich mir ehrlich dreht sich die Erde verkehrt?
Es gibt Gebiete auf der Welt da ist ?n Leben nichts wert!
Es ist menschenverachtend, es werden Rassen getrennt
Die Kasse klingelt wenn die Motorsäge Bäume durchtrennt
Hörst do die Sinfonie? Sie hat ?n unglaublich schönen Klang!
Es ist ein Herzschlag der entscheidet um uns alle man

Man ich seh?s nicht ein bin kein gewaltverherrlichender Rapper
Ehemals Inhaftierte ritzen meinen Namen mit ?nem Messer
Auf die Wände, auf die Bänke, auf die Skateboardunterseite
Häng mein Poster in dein Zimmer auf und tapeziere meine
Logos in der you-Bahn leise und bekleb? die Rotlichtmeile
Votet, logt euch ein und tragt euch ein zur Al?Massiva-Reise
Das sind handfeste beweise, ich recorde, ihr seid leise
Das sind kontroverse Texte ihr zieht alles in die Scheisse
Ich hab diesen Hype und Film krass mathematisch vorbereitet
Ihr zerlegt mein Werdegang in hunderttausend Einzelteile
Hunderttausend Platten reichen ich will noch viel mehr erreichen
Vor euch steht ?n Typ auf den jetzt hunterttausend Finger zeigen

Refrain :

Ich bin deutscher HipHop und brüll alles aus der Seele raus
Die Kugeln reissen uns zu Boden doch wir stehen wieder auf
Ich bin fast verblutet auf dem langen Weg ins Krankenhaus
Der deutsche Rap benötigt mich guck eine Kugel reicht nicht aus

Vollstabiler Körperbau, krimineller Lebenslauf
Übertrieben tättowiert, krassmoderner Gangstersound
Ich sprech aus dem Herzen unsrer deutschen Bundesrepublik
Ich bin dieser pfälzer Junge der jetzt Wahlberliner ist

(Part 2):

Ich bin ein Erfolgsgarant, der geschliffene Diamant
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herrn jetzt fängt das Theater an
Ich benötig? nicht wie Obelix ?n Kessel Zaubertrank
Verfluche euch wie Mandela und mal den Teufel an die Wand
Ich zieh magnetisch Geister an, buh ich bin so geisteskrank
Ich battle Kevin Costner weil ich jetzt mit einem Löwen tanz
Ich verbiege deinen Schlagring mit Magie wie Uri Geller
Meine dritte Platte scratches DJ?s auf dem Plattenteller

Man ich roll das are so krass, dass es wie ?n 12-Zylinder-Motor klingt
Ich steiger das Tempo stark, ihr benutzt ?n Tempomat
Rostet vor euch hin und zahlt noch immer mit ?ner deutschen Mark
Ihr verachtet Menschenrechte, ich hab gar nichts inszeniert
Ich werd? täglich observiert, abgehört und kontrolliert
Spitts pervers, Text perfekt, Visacard I'm Handgepäck
Ich erfind? und definier ?ne neue Art von Gangsterrap
Ihr müsst euern Akku laden, was Testosteron geladen?!
Zerr? ?n Laster vor mich hin und ihr schiebt lässig Kinderwagen
Ich beantwort? all die Fragen ich bin Marketingstratege
Füll die Lücken I'm System und löcher euch wie ?n schweizer Käse

Man ihr lästert und ihr hofft dass mich die Majors abservieren
Ich bin der der mit dem Löwen tanzt
Ich vergleich mein allgemeines Wissen, mit ?nem vollgestopften Bücherschrank
Ach ich bin so geisteskrank, schizophren und selbstbewusst
Ich bin suizidgefährdet jagt mir Kugeln in die Brust
Legt mich larm, gibt mir lebenslänglig Einzelhaft
Selbst wenn ich den Jackpot knacke bleibt ?n Gangster eingeschnappt
Vom Sozialempfänger zum Gewerbeamt das ist mein Werdegang
Scheiss auf Schufa ich meld? ?n Gewerbe an
Man sieht?s mir an dass ich gezeichnet bin, guck ich zeichne vor mich hin
All mein Wissen steckt in all den Zeilen drinn?
Das ist die Platte die den Markt zersägt
Ich release ?n Meisterwerk, und nicht irgendso ein Demotape

Das ist mein Album number three
Meine Hände bluten kommt wir schreiben das Kapitel neu (kommt)
Fühl mich wie neugeboren, 
Ich mach jetzt endlich reinen Tisch
Massiv ist back, 
Dieser Junge der die Nerven trifft (kommt)

Auf diesen Tag 
Habe ich mich so sehr gefreut,
Ich hab mich so danach gesehnt, 
Ich hab noch gar nichts bereut.

Jeder Schritt war gut durchdacht,
Ich wurde zum Rapstar über Nacht,
Ich hab die Scheiße angepackt
Man ich hab aus der Scheiße Gold gemacht.

Ihr seit jetzt erst aufgewacht,
Man ich bin überhaupt nicht satt,
Ich bin nur ein junge aus der Pfalz,
Ich hab ein Traum gehabt.

Mir kommt das alles vor wie ein Dejavú,
Bin so populär, dass selbst ein Richter der mich in den Bau gebracht hat grüßt.

Wer nicht schwört der lügt,
Wer mich nicht hört betrügt,
Mein Sound sorgt für Gänsehaut,
Weil meine Stimme jeder fühlt.

Das ist meine Zeit,
Das ist mein Album number three,
Meine Zeit ist reif
Es wurde Zeit, dass ich Geschichte schreib.

Ihr seht es selbst wegen mir hören Rapper auf zu rappen,
Die Labels schließen ihre Pforten um sich selbst zu retten,

Ihr seit nur ein Augenblick,
M.A.S ein Lebenlang,
Wenn do das bezweifelst,
Greifst do mich bei meiner Ehre an

2x Hook

Das ist mein Album number three
Meine Hände bluten kommt wir schreiben das Kapitel neu (kommt)
Fühl mich wie neugeboren,

Ich wurde gesegnet guck das Leben meint es gut mit mir,
Es war nicht immer so in der Vergangenheit ist viel passiert.

Ich weiß man sagt lass die Vergangenheit vergangen sein,
Doch für manche Menschen kann das einfach nicht so einfach sein.(Nein)

Ich bin schon öfters gescheitert doch meine Hoffnung bleibt,
Hab das beste Forum man ich will nie wieder einsam sein.

Nie wieder ganz allein ich will mein Leben mit euch teilen,
Scheiß auf die Kritiker jetzt kommt endlich meine Zeit.

Mir wird voll warm ums Herz, wenn ich daran denken muss,
Wie die Kinder sich mein ALbum kaufen kurz vor Ladenschluss

Dass ein Kind dann warte muss man das tut mir ehrlich leid,
Am liebsten würde ich euch meine Platten eigenhändig verteilen
Und sie dann Hand signieren.

Scheiß auf das Geschenkpapier,
Reiß es auf schieb es in den Player und lass dich entführen,
An einem Ort wo man dich Respektiert.

M.A.S rappt für die Masse,
Ich bin viel zu weit jetzt kommt endlich meine Zeit

E-Gitarrenaction ich bin Kurt Cobain der Ghettopate
Ja jetzt gibt?s ?ne Mischung zwischen Sex, Drugs und Rock ?N Roll
Bin begabt wie Mick Jagger, Al?Massiva, Rolling Stone
Mit dieser Hymne laufen Boxer in den Ring
Ich hab die Augen eines Tiger wenn der Rundengong erklingt
Ich ziel auf Kinn und täusche an und setz ?n Leberhaken
Lauer wie ein Löwe wie in Max Schmeling?s besten Tagen
Jetzt fliessen Gagen wie bei Tysen gegen Holyfield
Ja man hört so einiges seit meinem ersten Majordeal
Ach do vermutest do wärst härter als ich?
Ich bin der Trainier eurer Trainer ich hab Ivan Drago?s Killerblick

So läuft?s ab in meiner Gegend, Liegestütze, Hantel heben
Vollverschwitzt in Ärsche treten, vollbrutales Nahkampftraining
Ja ich ess? bloß Reis und Pute ihr frisst Schokoladenkuchen

Ich verknote deine Zunge, do hast keine Kondition
Do willst Ballerina werden ich schick dich zu Detlef Soost

Sie sind ganz verwahrlost und sie bitten nur um eine Bitte
Ich seh Menschen schicken ihre Eltern in das Altersheim
Sie ham sie großgezogen doch jetzt sind sie ganz allein

Dich zu Boden drücken sogar wenn do grad? nach Gnade flehst

Morgen lügt man um in Ruhe zu feiern und geht darauf Fremd,
Liebesbriefe enden meist zerrissen, wer erkennt den wert des Menschen heutzutage ohne Geld? Zwei Augen stets verschlossen denn beisammen sein ist nichts mehr wert, alles wird jetzt gut für dich, Hör doch endlich auf dein Herz, der Gestank der Menschen wenn sie labbern füllt den Raum, jeder Macht hier jeden klein Missgunst gibt's bei Mann und Frau, weiße Tauben bei ner' Hochzeit das war früher mal,
Ehepaare machen für die Gäste einen Stripper klar, ehrlich wahr, uns ist nichts geblieben wie es war, ich erinner mich an damals als das anders war.

In deinen Händen wärmst und du ihn danach küsst

Auch wenn in meinem Fall viel zu viel dagegen spricht

Sie vergiften deinen Körper und vergraben dich
Ich zum Beispiel war 24 Stunden da
Ich wurde Zeuge das ein Bruder nach dem andern starb
Die  Straße lässt es zu, dass man dich abschiesst
All das Blut fliesst durch die  Straßen  ohne Abschied
Die Straße lockt die Brüder und lässt sie fallen
Ich sah so viele Kids die sich einfach so die Drogen knallen

So wird das nie was, wenn du nur in deiner Ecke hockst
Los, Kinder, essen komm', ich hab' Crystal Meth gekocht
Was weißt du von meinem Land und den Bergen?
Tausend Bewerbungen schreiben, aber abgelehnt werden, he?
Was weißt du von den Pissern, die nur nach Kohle fragen
Doch hinterm Rücken mehr Gesichter als Emojis haben?
Immer wenn der Mond etwas Licht auf das Ghetto wirft
Siehst du 'nen bewaffneten Kanaken aus der Esso stürm'
Und wird's euch mal zuviel, fliegt ihr in Privatjets weg
Doch Cenk und ich haben heut ein Meeting auf Parkdeck 6
Aus im Park spielen wird schnell Gras dealen
Hellwach, bis Sirenen dich in den Schlaf wiegen
Cash kommt und geht, ich hab' die Hoffnung nicht gesehen
Denn was ich wirklich wollte, hat am Horizont gefehlt

Hier weinen Mütter, wenn die Kripo durch die Türe platzt
All die Herzen bluten, wenn der Mond in mein Ghetto kracht
Hätt' ich's mir ausgesucht, wär' es ein Haus und Pool
Ich krieg' kein Auge zu, wenn der Mond in mein Ghetto kracht
Koks wird aus Flex gemacht, aus Not wird das Geld geschafft
Hier brennt die Luft, wenn der Mond in mein Ghetto kracht

Massive Attack,"Can't be with the one you love, then love the one you're with
Spliff in the ashtray, red stripe, I pull the lid
Her touch tickles, especially when she's gentle
But I don't hear her words 'cause I slide the instrumental
Keep the girl in the distance, moves are very hazy
No sunshine in my life the way I deal is shady

Skip hip data to get the anti-matter
Blue lines are the reason why the temple had to shatter
To the sound of silence surrounded by the mass
Her face is on the paper, not the strangers that I pass
The ones that are looking back to see if they are looking back at me

Are you predator, or do you fear me?

Yeah, while I'm doing this, I know
The place I really wanna go
The one I love but never gets near me

It's a beautiful day well, it seems as such
Beautiful thoughts means I dream too much
Even if I told you, you still would not know me
Tricky never does, Adrian mostly gets lonely
How we live in this existence, just being
English upbringing, background Caribbean

It's the way that we billety
Sharing a soliloquy
We cut the broken thread from flexibility
Mi chiamo 3D si sono Inglese
No sunshine in my life because the way I deal is hazy
And everyday's a daisy 'cause I'm on my toes
While contemporaries of mine remaining comatose

There's a looking glass she's looking through
She hated me, but then she loved me too
I'd lie, not try, so I lost faith
Then turn to her to keep the faith
She told me, 'take an occupation, or you lose your mind.'
And on a nine-to-five lemon, looking for the lime

Box clever, watch your system come together
Crazy weather at the end of my tether

Massive in the area, murderer
Attack in the area, murderer

Some go softly, softly round the habitat
Ratchet in the right hand
They got no one to stab it at
Take a walk, Billy, don't be a hero
Effort's on minimal though almost touch zero
Excommunicated from the brotherhood of man
To wander lonely as a puzzled anagram

Car paint blue, green, primer and zinc
Take it to extremities, my purple and pink
I feel the colours fill my room beneath the patter of the rain
I can't stand the drops that dribble down my windowpane
They wash away my shadow and don't even leave a mark upon my soul
They leave the rainbows in the dark

Blues get big, Massive are even larger
Save enough space into the tricky tardies
We'd trawl what I saw from down in Darren's hall
People laying their claim
In stormy weather it's rain

But you're living on a see-saw
I try to see more

Somebody da-ditty, nobody
Walking on sunshine, but, still, we're treading water
The son of many reasons searching for the daughter
Seeking knowledge, not acknowledging the jet-set
Silver papers of the sound within my Budakon headset
The solar system watches in wisdom
The children dance as the moonlight kissed them

To Massive Attack, Matt Black appear wearing beads

Thinking about the things we used to do
Watching lovers in the park making love so free
And now I realize there's only me

Lately baby where, where did we go wrong

You been acting like a cat on a hot tin roof
Something's on your mind that you can't share
You never used to hide your feelings from me
Keeping secrets I don't understand

Lately baby where, where did we go wrong
Lately baby where, where did we go wrong

I used to synchronize it with your body
Making it so tight never letting go

These good people, dream on

Nicer than the bird up in the tree top
Cheaper than the chip inside my lap top
All the variations you could do with me
Nicer than the girl up in your mind you're free

You kinda fade into the background
Like a better smoke'll bring you back round
Like a man slide inside you my dear
Your cheap beer's filled with crocodile tears

Way that we say 'em in style that we write 'em in
Massive attack we keep it strong just like a vitamin
Going for the positive wiping out the negative songs
'Cause brother it's relative
The pass is picking up all the lyrics on the dance floor
That raise your spirit level 'cause it demands for

Attitude is cool degrees below zero
Up against the wall behaving like De Niro
Tricky's performing taking his phono
Making a stand with a tan touch it like cocoa
Smooth to keep you moving at the back now
Free is the needle it's moving through the track now

Dance to the drummer's beats we need new sticks
Bounce around the vibes like acoustics
No drugs or pharmaceuticals for the body ain't suitable
Stick with liquid me and trick we've drop
A paper which you use my tongue to lick with

Trouble and strife ain't no sunshine in my life
Wiseguys get protection when they carry a knife
They shouldn't have been born they're making me yawn
But I just take it easy it's a Sunday morn'

So you come on light my fire and
Together we'll grow forever watch my eight kay rig go

Because my eight kay rig goes boom boom
My eight kay rig goes boom

Yeah rhymin' the jam and uh we got the stamina
In case you never know us if we don't give a damn and uh
And it's hard to handle keep your distance
Resist and the posse gets the pleasure of this dance
The cool breeze that you welcome in the heat
You don't see it but you feel it when it's blowing on the street

If i was a rich man

Da da dada

I quietly observe standing in my space
It's the devious days they call the rat race
It's a concrete jungle, evil in the town
Weebles, wobble, occasional squabble
But what happen when the bomb drops
Down

Don't make sound
'Cause the dance floor's a desert
And the dancers are parched
Do a rain dance and your brain's still marsh
My heavy my brother get lighter than helium
Float above the world to break the tedium
Living in my headphones Sony's what I say to 'em
The surreal boom of the budokan stadium

Well I'm floating on air when I'm daydreaming
I quietly observe standing in my space

Well I'm tricky kid don't deal with sadness
Can't be with the one i love i love the one that i miss
I'm very down to earth but brain sits on top floor
Don't need another lover just need, I'm insecure

The weather is a changin' the storms be shakin'
The love that you take is equal to the love you're makin'
Here comes the sun little darlin' here comes the sun
It's alright

Yes tricky kid i check my situation
Maggie this Maggie that Maggie means inflation
Hip-hop you don't stop cause I'm not sloppy
I like the beat so we need another copy

We're natives of the massive territory and we're proud
Get peaceful in the dance, adapt the glory and the crowd
The problem ain't a different kind of skin tricks
I love my neighbour I don't wait for the Olympics
See you go hooligan you're trying to play the fool again

Caught you in the lost and found

When your posse weren't around

No crowd

So you're going for you tool again

Two undernourished egos four rotating hips
Hold on to me tightly, I'm a sliding scale

Can't endure then you can't inhale
Clearly, out of body experience interferes
And dreams of flying, I fit nearly
Surrounds me though I get lonely

She's moving up slowly, slowly
Moving up slowly, inertia creeps
Moving up slowly, she comes

Moving up slowly, she comes

Moving up slowly, she comes
Moving up slowly, moving up slowly

In my home no chrome as clear as
See me now with my nearest dearest
Been there when I'm over careering

Room shifting is endearing
Between us is our kitchen
Would you found my irritant's itching?
Been here before, been here forever

Moving up slowly, inertia keeps
Moving up slowly, inertia creeps

Moving up slowly, inertia keeps
Moving up slowly, inertia creeps
Moving up slowly, she comes

I make no sound in my eider town
Awake I lie in the morning's blue
Room is still my antenna in you
Nylon burns the bed spread with two

Gravity's zero see me stall
I bounce off walls lose my footing and fall
It can be sweet though incomplete though
And the frames will freeze, see me on all four's

It's been a long time
She comes, she comes
I want to X you, she comes
I want to X you, she comes

I caught your radio waves
I caught your radio waves
Will you take a string?
Say, you string me along

Inertia creeps and she comes

Way that we say 'em in style that we write 'em in
Massive attack we keep it strong just like a vitamin
Going for the positive wiping out the negative songs
'Cause brother it's relative
The pass is picking up all the lyrics on the dance floor
That raise your spirit level 'cause it demands for

Attitude is cool degrees below zero
Up against the wall behaving like De Niro
Tricky's performing taking his phono
Making a stand with a tan touch it like cocoa
Smooth to keep you moving at the back now
Free is the needle it's moving through the track now

Dance to the drummer's beats we need new sticks
Bounce around the vibes like acoustics
No drugs or pharmaceuticals for the body ain't suitable
Stick with liquid me and trick we've drop
A paper which you use my tongue to lick with

Trouble and strife ain't no sunshine in my life
Wiseguys get protection when they carry a knife
They shouldn't have been born they're making me yawn
But I just take it easy it's a Sunday morn'

So you come on light my fire and
Together we'll grow forever watch my eight kay rig go

Because my eight kay rig goes boom boom
My eight kay rig goes boom

Yeah rhymin' the jam and uh we got the stamina
In case you never know us if we don't give a damn and uh
And it's hard to handle keep your distance
Resist and the posse gets the pleasure of this dance
The cool breeze that you welcome in the heat
You don't see it but you feel it when it's blowing on the street

If i was a rich man

Da da dada

I quietly observe standing in my space
It's the devious days they call the rat race
It's a concrete jungle, evil in the town
Weebles, wobble, occasional squabble
But what happen when the bomb drops
Down

Don't make sound
'Cause the dance floor's a desert
And the dancers are parched
Do a rain dance and your brain's still marsh
My heavy my brother get lighter than helium
Float above the world to break the tedium
Living in my headphones Sony's what I say to 'em
The surreal boom of the budokan stadium

Well I'm floating on air when I'm daydreaming
I quietly observe standing in my space

Well I'm tricky kid don't deal with sadness
Can't be with the one i love i love the one that i miss
I'm very down to earth but brain sits on top floor
Don't need another lover just need, I'm insecure

It was day-glo painted
You see me I'm a drinker
You see me now I'm sainted
Chased by the plaintive
Haunted by the medium

Glow from my tv set was blue like neon

On the waves that blow wild and free
He splices the ropes and he sets the sail
While southwards he roams to the home of the whale

And he never thinks of me far behind
Or the torments that rage in my mind
He is mine for only part of the year
Then I'm left all alone with only my tears

All ye ladies that smell of white rose
Thank ye for your perfume to wear on my gold
Thank ye all the wives and the babies that yearn
For the man never returns from hunting the sperm

Oh my love, he works upon the sea
On the waves that blow wild and free
He splices the ropes and he sets the sail
While southwards he roams to the home of the whale

Massive Attack,"The big wheel keeps on turning
On a simple line day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggle while another relaxes

There's a hole in my soul like a cavity
Seems like the world is out to gather just by gravity
The wheel keeps turning the sky's rearranging
Look my son the weather is changing

I'd like to feel that you could be free
Look up at the blue skies beneath a new tree
Sometime again
You'll turn green and the sea turns red
My son I said the power of axis over my head
The big wheel keeps on turning
On a simple line day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggle while another relaxes

We sang about the sun and danced among the trees
And we listened to the whisper of the city on the breeze
Will you cry in the most in a lead-free zone
Down within the shadows where the factories drone
On the surface of the wheel they build another town
And so the green come tumbling down
Yes close your eyes and hold me tight
And i'll show you sunset sometime again

The big wheel keeps on turning
On a simple line day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggle while another relaxes
As a child's silent prayer my hope hides in disguise
While satellites and cameras watch from the skies
An acid drop of rain recycled from the sea
It washed away my shadow burnt a hole in me
And all the king's men cannot put it back again
But the ghetto sun will nurture life
And mend my soul sometime again

Massive Attack,"Trendy Wendy's you know what I mean
Hangin' around with girl who's rolling up her jeans
She watches her street crack 'cause she's no dummy
Through rocking the microphone and she's calling me honey
Says I know what I want don't move with thugs
Well house parties hip hop and smoking drugs
And whoever's been the boss she's down with 'em
She's always on time 'cause the girl got rhythm
To avoid a complication i'll give some information
About a certain occasion under an illustration
'Cause when I host my show-a I avoid the girl called lola
Who's more pu-pu-public than the drink they call it coca cola
I'm just practice posing face is shaded in black
Is dominating as my color the massive attack
Right now i hit it kick it flow smooth hit middle wicket

I take a small step now it's a giant stride
People say I'm loud why should I hide
Only had a small taste so what a waste
I quietly observe though it's not my space
Bottom end's heavy you know we're never even
People call me Tricky for particular reason
I've got you see and I've got to let you know
See we're rockin' in your area rock beneath your balcony
My baby just cares for me well that's funny
Her touch tickles especially on my tummy

Now who's got the microphone
Now who's honey

A turbo turbo and charge with a charge
I be daddy g wild bunch crew at large
Don't call a officer just call me a sarge
Mashing up the country and also abroad
Plan to go to America when I get a visa card

But gettin' a visa card nowadays isn't hard

So keep your ears glued listen to every chord
Tokyo city's one place that we toured
Four technique plus two mixer board
Sharper than a Wilkinson razor sword

When I was a child I played subbuteo on
My table then I graduate to studio one
My nom de plume got my pseudo no
And around my neck you know I wear the sony budokan
Indigo blues you got me in my own shoes
The people dancing in the shape
For what they make they can't lose
Yes waxing lyrical but this time it's not satirical
It's kinda spherical so jam me in a
This is the miracle of the dubplate dub selection

So whether you're black white or half-caste in your complection

Yes pull out your phono plug and tuck you in your phony
It's started by Marconi resumed by Sony
A summary a while is a history and only
But massive attack enorme explosione

We don't want it
Get away with your guns now

Bounce around the vibes like acoustics

Looking for you in my flashlight, I'm searching
From in the high or down the ocean
And I face myself in reason
Gain the wolf
Gain the wolf

Conjure me as a child
Slipping down a web side
Stretch up I cannot reach him
Jumping up they drag him from the water

I watch them march him into life
I watch them take him from the pale
Into the sky for your eagle eye
The sun seeds a sickle and a scythe

Ridicule they won't allow
Quench abuse and let love flower
Rip the cage out of your chest
Let the chaos rule the rest

Show without showing
What you know without knowing
Twigs snap eye/I catch no canoe only you and me
Alone on the old tea hope sea

Dissolving who we are
Call out for yesterdays destiny come
We're on a foreign shore

It was your mark of falling
I was the car still running
And will you call and be assured for life
And if you feel it you will fly
The sun should have been with me

And I was set to fall in

Throwing shapes in a gangster lean
Ignoring wars on gasoline
I got some yearning, God I'm made to get high
God's left hand wasn't made to get by
Got more highs left in me
And there's more room in recovery

From evil states that strip all chrome
From Marshall Amps into broken homes
And borstal blues to countless cliques
That rhythm sticks to those classic chicks
Still your tears and drown your fears
All is clear in a glass of beer

In the south west lands
One time in the kingdom
Believe is on the sand

I know what you need

Paper chase

And we'll never learn

The bankers have bailed
The mighty retreat
The pleasure it fails
At the end of the week
You take it or leave
Or what you receive
To what you receive

Masta Ace,"[Master Ace] 
Awww yeah! Uh uh huh 
One two microphone check one two 
Microphone check one two microphone check one two 
Tell you what I'm gonna do 

On and on and on is how the beat goes 
So sell the British Walkers and cut the afros 
And dance till the feeling is gone in your toes 
I wear shorts in the summer Timberlands when it snows 
Sometimes I like to chill sometimes I like to mingle 
Sometimes I get the fever for the flavor of a single 
Sexy young slimmy, but not too young, though 
That's because Jimmy might end up on death row 
Now this here jam is like a special kind of song 
It's not too short, but then again it's not too long 
I brought someone with me, someone you might know 
He's bound to wreck your body from the tip of your toe 
All the way up to your last hair follicle 

[Biz Markie] 
Hey hey hey, it's me the diabolical 
Yes, y'all and, it's time for me to fall in 
To a funky beat to make you have a ball and 
Jump, make you move your rump on the floor and like pump 
C'mon don't be a chump, I see four and maybe five 
Live party people but the rest did not survive 
(Why?) They had a cardiac arrest 
Now rocking microphones is something I do daily and 
Making people dance like if I was Albert Alien 
People just love it when the Biz starts to play 
With my (beatboxing), and by the way 
Skeezing with a girl is something I get tricky 
And I'm the sneaky type to like slip a girl a Mickey 
And I live the type of life that's far from affordable 
Standing on the corner calling cuties on the portable 
Me and Master Ace is FONKY (Word to Miz) 
Yo, who is it Ace? (It's me and the Biz) 

It's me and the Biz [x4]

[Biz Markie] 
Yo Ace, I got an, um, question 
Excuse me brother, but can you spare a dime? 

[Master Ace] 
Naw, but if you want, I can kick a funky rhyme 
All I need is a groove that's as smooth as a harp and 
I'm ready to talk nuff shit like Al Sharpton 
I take the stage and engage in a page and 
My name is Master Ace and 22 is the age 

[Biz Markie] 
Yo, I'm the B-I-Z M and, like a lot of women 
Bought a new car because the first one was a lemon 
Oochie Louie Findy, me and Sexy Cindy 
Riding around the block as if I was in the Indy 
Everybody pointing cause I am the joint and 
They know it's me, because I'm the B-I-Z 
Sometimes I lie in bed all day and think about my life 
Should I just kick rap and settle down with kids and a wife? 
And get a regular job where I'm working 9 to 5 
Shit, I'm the Biz and it's great to be alive 

[Master Ace] 
I'm making crazy hits, a winner never quits 
So those that used to diss me in the past are having fits 
But I just sit back and kick my feet up on the table 
Cause I'm able to rock a crowd without a cable 
Or a Cuban Link and (Yo, Lincoln wasn't Cuban!) 
So I still produce Def Jams like my name was Ricky Rubin 
M-A-S-T-E-R and this ain't store bought hip-hop from a jar and 
It sure ain't Stephanie Mills playing Dorothy in the Wiz 
It's me and the Biz 

It's me and the Biz [x4] 

[Master Ace] 
I'm a 100% proof and rag on the roof and 
Pulling crazy cuties without a gold tooth 
Wilding, styling, this land is my land 
(You're a) prisoner to my music like you was on Riker's Island 
A slim, soft-spoken brother from the ghetto 
My name is Master Ace and I thought that you should know 
You run your rhymes like a horse and force 
Extra booty lyrics on the crowd like you're the boss 
I think you'd better keep them to yourself 
Do it for yourself, put your lyrics back up on the shelf 
Now I'm going to pass it to the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E 
'Cause I know you want to see him 

[Biz Markie] 
Ah one two, one two, this is what I'm gonna do 
Keep the place jumping, get it wild like a zoo 
If anyone can do it, the B-I-Z can 
Peace to Marley Marl, Tagedy, and MC Shan 
And my cousin Cool V and, TJ Swan E and 
The Jungle Brothers swinging from a tree and 
EPMD and, Nice and Smooth B and 
MC Craig G and, Just I-C-E and 
The list goes on and on and on and on 
I go to Dapper Dan or Bennetton 

Hey hey, I got some shout outs, I know you all bought my new album 
I know everybody in Brooklyn bought it 
Everybody in Jersey bought it 
Everybody in uptown bought it 
Eveerybody in Philidelphia and California and Florida bought my new album 
I'm Biz Markie, I'm down with my cousin Cool V, TJ Swan, Marley Marl...",Me and the Biz (Extended Version)
Masta Ace,"Let's get wild
 Yeah, Master Ace in the house
 The whole Action Posse's in the house
 Ice-you-Rock's in the house, DJ Marley Marl's in the house
 Steady Pace is in the house, and we gonna do it like this

So many New Jacks and Jills on the hill
But only one bucket, so fuck it, they get the dills
Cause you no frills, that means your name ain't household
Now watch that little mouse fold
You can't take the pressure from the cooker
Stood there looking soft, so I started hooking off
And took her, I know she used to be yours
Now she's riding on the bus with us and doing tours
Along with some other little runts
We call her a fall girl, she does so many stunts
And then she got liver, she did it with the guy that drives the bus
Now she's a screw driver
Master Ace is flipping
Your grip is slipping, it's time I start stripping
Young ladies and the titles that hold 'em
I treat 'em like a pretzel: bend, stretch, and fold 'em
And I can do the same damage on stage
Black, white, or beige, you're gonna feel the rage
The same way the sluts with the big butts felt it
I'm not a dealer but I dealt it
So if you plan on riffing when I spank ya
Be prepared to grab your ankles because

	(Ace is wild!) No, not really
	(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
	(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
	(Ace is wild!) Come on, stop illing

For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for all of those
Who lost out, cause I was at the polls
And I saw the results as they came in
So many wild-ass ones that need taming
But I hold a whip and a chair
And I don't play fair, so you'd better stay there
Until I say ""Jump through the fire""
But I won't get burned, I learned to admire
>From way across the room first
And after I study, buddy, that's when I kick a verse
That's high powered, you got devoured
By the jaws of death, you little coward
Scared to step in this arena
Where the grass is greener, you're looking meaner and meaner
But your look ain't scaring me away
So I just stay and say words to make your head sway
Capital A-see-E, boy
Serving the masses, you'd better take some classes
If you want to hang with this here
And if you get near, I'll eat you like a pear (Crunch)
But I don't really eat a lot of fruit
So say ""ahh"" (Mmmmmmph!) Now don't you look cute?

	(Ace is wild!) Nah, no I'm not
	(Ace is wild!) I just like to bug a lot
	(Ace is wild!) Leave me alone
	(Ace is wild!) Turn up the microphone
	(Ace is wild!) Yeah...

Mr. Gangster, who you trying to kid?
Fake, flam, and fess and dress the way you did
This is a microphone war
You say you're well-known, but what are you known for?
A porno flick and a hard dick
And always bragging about the girls you stick
Title for king? Yo I don't compete for that
Paid your dues? Let me see a receipt for that
Somebody put you on yesterday
And you fess today, and that's just the way
A sucker is supposed to operate
Just turn on my mic and I'm straight
Now you fronting like you got a million G's
Just because you sold a couple of LP's
Now you walking around thinking you're the man
Cause you bought a little suit from Dapper Dan
But so what? You still ain't dapper
Holding the mic makes you look like a rapper
But you're just a sloppy copy cat
Front on me and I'm a hit you with a bat
Bottom of the ninth, two out, and I'm at the plate
And SMACK! Over the left field gate
That's where your head goes, you're Rudolph the Red Nosed
And you can't join in, you shouldn't have said those
Rhymes that sound so merrily merrily
Since you're soft like poundcake from Sarah Lee
I might cut a slice, then say ""What a nice
Sucker to gobble up with beans and rice""
You fat little rat from the sewer
I eat you like a meal, pass you like maneuer
Put you in the garden where my flower grows
Then where's your power? Tell me where your power goes
Somebody does your dirty work for you
Throw up your hands like a man so I can floor you
And oh, if you pull a jammie
You can run from Brooklyn to Miami
>From Miami to Nevada
You'd better have a lotta, I mean a whole knot of
Payola, cause I'm about to roll a
Mic like a cess joint, so brother here's a bowl of
Pride, now eat it up
Cause I get kind of wild when I heat it up

	(Ace is wild!) Nah, not really
	(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
	(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
	(Ace is wild!) Yo yo yo, stop illing
	(Ace is wild!) No, I'm not
	(Ace is wild!) I feel kinda hot
	(Ace is wild!) But I'm not acting wild
	(Ace is wild!) You know that ain't my style
	(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just cooling
	(Ace is wild!) And also I'm ruling
	(Ace is wild!) I ain't messing with nobody
	(Ace is wild!) I just want to have a party
	(Ace is wild!) No, no
	(Ace is wild!) Come on, yo
	(Ace is wild!) It's me and Marley Marl
	(Ace is wild!) And I'm the Music Man, y'all",Ace Iz Wild
Masta Ace,"Yeah
Just sittin' here in the studio, you know
Thinking about the old days
And reminiscin' about how things used to be
I can remember back then real well

Come in
Oh, what up, yo
Ice U Rock in the house
What's up y'all?
(What's up)
Yo, I was here in the studio, you know
Reminiscin' about the past and how things used to be
(Word)
You know
Big man Uneek is here, my man Master Ice, you know
Ehm
Yo Ice, won't you, you know
Talk a little bit about the old days from what you can remember

As I reminisce back growin' up around my way
I can't help but think about the games we used to play
We used to play games that would make parents mutter
Like Tag, Spider, and Hot Peas and Butter
We rode our bikes through Prospect Park
Did jumps over hills and came back before dark
We even rode skateboards downtown and back
In fact, we were scared, so razorblades we would pack
Played basketball ( ? ), and we
Played Chinese handball at a park called [Name]
And he who lost was forced to play the wall
And then got hit in the butt with the ball
And after we worked up a sweat and got loose
We bought a Hero and a fifty cent juice

Word yo
Uneek, Uneek, remember back in the day?
Yo, let's Ice finish

Just think about when your moms used to dress you it hurts
Church shoes and real loud shirts
Feelin' dumb, so yourself you redeem
You buy some mocknecks and some tailor-made gabardines
Remember those pants with the pockets on the side
You wore with your Pumas and strutted with every stride?
The winter months appeared to be ( ? )
You sported snow boots, leather bomber, then sheepskins
Then when you felt the spring breeze
You bought a name buckle to wear with your Lee's
Campus shorts and shirts in the heat
With a nylon do rag, Adidas on your feet
With real thick laces (Ha!) Am I lying? Shoot
Don't even front, you even had a Hawaiian suit

Haha
Crazy, I never had a Hawaiian suit, man
Yo Uneek, go 'head

The nineties are here, times are going fast
And it's the perfect time to reminisce about the past
When I think about it, I get a pang
And hear people back then talk with they slang
I hear it now, it sounds corny
When 'give me a pound' was 'lay some skin on me'?!
People wore afros and called it their natural
And if you were soft back then, it meant that you
Were a sucker boy who used to irk me
You never was really down, a jive-time turkey
Most other kids used to joke and diss
It was called a ( ? ) and it'd sound like this
(That's why you got rejects) then the next guy would say
(But my rejects are new and yours are old, okay?)

Word
Now we sayin Big Uneek

As I reminisce I'll always remember
1984, the month was September
My first year of high school and every fool knows
You had to dress fresh and look hype in your school clothes
I had the clothes with something added
A gold name plate when a few people had it
Now that was trouble, cause you would get robbed
On the bus goin' home, by a crazy large mob
They'd sneak on the back of the bus and they looked
For somethin' they wanted, what they found was what they took
One day they found me, standin' in the lane
They didn't hesitate to say, ""Shorty, run your chain""
Before I could fight someone snatched it and jetted
Everyone was a victim and I'll never forget it

Word, man
Them times were kinda rough, man
Yo Ace, you remember times like that, man?

Yeah, I can remember like back then, son
You didn't have to worry about a knife or a gun
You balled up your fist like a man and fought your fight
And kept your left up if your brother taught you right
(Word) Back then, a fist was your best weapon
So you threw up your hands instead of just steppin'
And if you lost, you lived to fight another day
I heard a brother say now there's no other way
To win a fight except to use a bullet
""The trigger makes me feel bigger when I pull it""
He said, I just shook my head at this
And that's what made me wanna reminisce

Yo come in
Oh yo, it's my dancers, the Big Steps in the house
My man Shawn, S Boogie
My man Glaze in the house
(Always chillin', yo
What's up y'all, how y'all doin man, y'all coolin'?)
(Of course, I'm always chillin')
Yo, y'all ain't gon' believe who's in the house
Y'all ain't gon' believe who's in the house
(Oh shit)
Yo, tell em who's in the house
The Big Steps, the Big Steps
The Big Steps, Big Steps, the Big Steps
The Big Steps, the Big Steps
The Big Steps, Big Steps, the Big Steps
Damn, why you gotta 'motherfucker' on everything?
I don't care
Word up, I ain't havin' it
Whose mother you're bonin'?
I know you're bonin' somebody's",As I Reminisce
Masta Ace,"Mmm...yeah that sound kinda ill...word...yeah... Master Ace in the 
Studio with my man Marley Marl why'know... Got DJ Clash in the 
House...and my DJ Steady Pace on the cut right? [Doin' the rest] 
Right so I'm about to get into somethin' here... 

I'm Master Ace from a place 
Or should I say borough 
Where they like the bass to be thorough 
With the kick of a mule 
And the click of a tool with no bullets 
In the clip, it's the trick of a fool 
'cause he who fronts gets blunts you can't smoke 
To pull such stunts is no joke 
You better know where you are first 
Try to be rude and get chewed like a Starburst 
Now how much juice you got? 
You couldn't hang if I made a noose and knot 
Now try that on for size 
Too much baseball, too many apple pies 
Click your heels three times, kid 
And now you can see what my rhymes did 
Suckers and nerds come in herds just like cattle 
First I brand them, then I hand them a rattle 
So they can make a little noise in protest 
Those that fussed got bust wearin' no vest 
I told that MC to go West 
Let's see who can put on a show best 
The creep that tried to sleep got no rest 
I got a rap that can trap a slow pest 
Where's your girl? She's out on a hoe quest 
Fingernail tips, red lips, summer stroll dressed 
In a camisole she's a pro blessed 
With a great big backside but no breasts 
Welcome to the fire pit 
I know some kids that wish you'd worn some flyer shit 
'cause as soon as you stepped off the train 
They woulda put a big nine to your brain 
Be on the lookout, and yo, keep lookin' 
'Cause there's a battle goin' on in Brooklyn. 

Just like the water in a river flows, I'm fluid 
And as I do it, I deliver blows 
So MCs, you better keep your left up 
Try to fight and you might just get F'd up 
'Cause I'll terminate, as you learn a great lesson 
Don't ever try messin' or you'll earn a fate 
Worse than death 'cause I'm here to give it to ya 
You got a life, but don't know how to live it do ya? 
I live on a day-to-day basis 
Doin' my shows in all kinds of places 
You sit home with a frowned-up grill 
Talkin' 'bout who ya gonna kill 
Well listen up psychopath 
Put down the Uzi, stop tryin' to play Shaft 
'Cause life ain't a TV screen 
Bullets can puncture the skin, rupture the spleen 
And the stuff that flows out your veins ain't ketchup 
Sit back, relax as I sketch up 
The scene on a Brooklyn street on a late night 
It was a great fight to me 
I was just an innocent bystander 
Let me try and, uh, explain why I'd hand a 
Brother a big fat stick 
Well it was that, or get his black ass kicked 
See, it was five against one 
But this brother was too proud to run 
So he stood in like a trooper 
Fightin' against all odds against a group of 
Brothers that looked the same way he looked, friend 
It was a battle in Brooklyn.",Brooklyn Battles

Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off them, I'm a come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
And the blow that I deliver is a crisp one
Give that style back, Jack, and try this one
If you're gonna pick up the microphone when the beat is moving swift
You'd better say something I can get with
Suckers I mold in my hand just like Silly Puddy
You tried to shank me, Spanky, but my name's not McGilnicutty
Yes yes, let's test the waters
Skinny dipping in a slaughter
Hope you wore your water proof hightop certified
Cause I taight you I got the murder ride
And you don't have to buy a ticket
You can afford to to get aboard and watch me as I stick it
In the face of my foes because it goes to show that I flow like a bloody nose
Raps are sweet just like a donut from Dunkin'
The Action Posse's at the door, and they won't let a punk in
So you'd better try the back door
Before you get a cracked jaw
And I don't need a black had to be a villain
The posse is Action and the label is Cold Chillin'
The question is how hype will you get?
When you heard this beat you was familiar with
A jam you heard before, this is a summary
A voice surrounds you, but there's only one of me
Lyrics of dialect come from all angles
The cordless mic in my hand still strangles
They try rather well, but none are parallel
The words are spinning in your head like a carosel
And out of all the brothers I spoke to
None of them broke through, they sound like a joke, too
Their rhymes are very soft, just like terry cloth
The kid's that standing on stage oughta hurry off
Cause that ain't hip-hop, you little drip-drop
Trying to tip-toe but can't touch the tip-top
Cause you ain't tall enough
Try to brawl and scuff with a style you're calling tough
Is about as tough as a flower
Beware of the posse raise to the third power
Cause we ain't caring, don't mind tearing a
Cocaine-pushing, Dapper Dan wearing
Walking around with a neck full of cables
My DJ laughs when you touch the turntables
Wannabe hard rock when you roll 10 deep
They told you my name but you act like you've been sleep
Get back, sit back and chill you no frill MC's
Slim see, but still I show skill
Words can brutalize without no mercy
Enemies wasting their last breath to curse me
I ain't Shaft with a hat and a Cadillac
MC's lash out, but should I battle back?
Nah, I remain calm and collected
The stage was empty the last time I checked it
But now there's movement there in the spotlight
I can't make out who it is, nah, not quite
A flash of gold from a shiny medallion
A stride of pride on stage like a stallion
Oh, another one of those who try to get close to
But can't cause a man's supposed to
Rip the mic til the crowd is perplexed, but
With this jam here, there won't be no next up
So peace to Craig G, Kane, G. Rap, and Marley Marl

Masta Ace,"""Is everybody ready? All right, here we go""
Allow me to begin, once again my friend
Yo, it's Ace in Action, here to send
Any and all MC's into a frenzy
Cause I'll take a rapper out just like a Benzi
Yeah, this ain't the same old, lame old
Bragging and nagging, yo all that became old
Years ago, and yo, here's a pro-
fession that will better and freshen the soul
I am going on and on like an adventure
Some of y'all are offered that cause I sent ya
Hmmm, this move is forward, or would
You like it if I pause, yeah you sure would
But I ain't pausing, no stop, just like a freeway
You're claiming too close, I need some leeway
Cause it's about time for the party to get a
Little bit hyper and yo, this is a letter to the better

So go check the mail for yours, I unveil the jaws
Then I dog ya, get down on all fours
So he can blow the capital A, the dream
Rhymes are fierce, pierce your ears like a laser beam
Reach, and I'll teach you each the speech
Spectrum, even if you add bleach
It won't fade or run, cause it's made of one-
hundred percent knowledge to weigh a ton
Listen bud, yo the rhyme's a dud
Pencil or pen and I'll draw
Blood I'll take a strong stance, strictly long pants
No short-taking, when you hear my song, dance!
Cause you can't keep still, so dance til
You drop or the hip-hop stop, but it never will
Yeah, now if you're better, then here's the move
Ace in Action, I'm here to show and prove
Plain and simple, you train my rhyme a pimple
Bust it, and watch it in your temple
You need Buffrin, you're suffering, can you cope?
Nah, nope, cause it's dope, and you hope
I might slip or trip, stall or fall
But all hope is lost, you've been stalled
Drugged, you've been bugged if I'd said a
Another line in this verse, this is a letter to the better

I'm flowing, so in fact, kind of rivery
Are you a dope MC? Special delivery
There's no time, here's a rhyme, go ahead open it
This is a letter to the better, I know you're hoping it
Might be some claim on my greatness
But once I state this, watch the crabs rate this
You wear a crown, you don't deserve one
You need a meal for the mind and I'll serve one
Like a chef so def, I'm gonna rip up
Rhymes they gonna rip up those that turn a lip up
One page at a time, you keep reading
Each stage of the rhyme, where's it leading?
You want to know where a path leads, you follow it
I feed you your pride and make you swallow it
Used to be an innocent bystander and the
Lotta years filled my ears with slander
Why should I choose to get used to the way you burn?
When will you learn that every rapper has a turn?
And when the spotlight shines on you, you ought to glow
And show, the next man how to grow
And so, enough said about yourself
The central wealth of our people is mental health
And good things come in due time
And through rhyme, watch as a few climb
Non stop, straight to the top just to get a
Great big piece of the pie, this is a letter to the better
",Letter to the Better [Remix]
Masta Ace,"Some rappers pick up the mic and like to dabble
But I'm gonna flow with the show and never babble
Take your hand, make your stand
To my left, Jeff, your a pest and you fessed and
I think you'd better find a new profession
You think that you want to be a rapper? Well I think you're guessing
No time for fessing or faking, messing or making
Mistakes, cause it takes heavyweights to stakes
Or high, so why would you ever want to front?
And try such a stunt, now the Ace is gonna hunt
Ya down, you clown, cause the sound that you're hearing is dope
You can't cope slowpoke, so pick up the soap
And catch a bad one, you wanted a chance and you had one
You lost it course you sad one
You can't get with the style you hit with
In this rhyme, so maybe next time

Uptown, downtown, crosstown, no matter where you're from
Get on the floor and get dumb
Cause the Master, capital A-see-E is about to kick it wicked
Here's the title, in your face I'm gonna stick it
But yo don't resh leash the speech that you use
Needs a little more spice, ice, you're nice
The style that I heard was third nerd, you gotta be sweet, Pete
You can't make money saying rhymes on the street
So yo get back, Jack, a smack is what you might just get
To the grill, Bill, so chill, or I might just swing, King
Crown, you're down you're like a wingless plane, Wayne
'Cause you ain't fly, in fact you try and I'm a rain
Right on your head so shed hats and coats
The votes are in friend, I win hands down, clown
You tried biting, but biting is a crime
So maybe next time

I like to cruise around the city, find me a witty
Seditty, sexy young lady that is pretty
(Meow meow meow) Says the kitty
The hotel room I got's a buck fifty
Booties in miniskirts, cuties and plenty Certs
To make sure my breath is up to par and
I introduce myself as the capital A the see the E
And say ""Hello"" and ""Bonjour"" if foreign
And if she's a little bit older I'll put her head on my shoulder
And hold, cause nobody told her
That the Master Ace, could move so many hips
Just by the sounds from my lips
Well um dinner was a winner, the movie was groovy
The park was dark as we walked and talked
Stayed and played, chased and raced
Sat and chat, shared and stared, into each other's eyes and lies
Spilled from your mouth right then
'Cause as we kissed you insisted, you had no boyfriend
But I know you cousin and your cousin dropped dime
Oh well, maybe next time

MC's acting wild better get calm
Or you'll get laughed at like like a sitcom
I spell my name A with the see-E
Not an ""LF"" folks, and I'm displaying ""Different Strokes""
Huh, I'm ""Head of the Class"" fast and furious
Rhymes as you get ""MASHed"" as I have ""Good Times""
And ""Happy Days"" I'm slick like a hummer
And smooth and kick my rhymes like a punter
""One Day at a Time"" is how I live life
So no I'm not ""Married With Children"" and no I do not have a wife
Instead I would prefer to have a girl and
Experience ""Growing Pains"" cause it's a ""Different World"" and
Rappers try to play me, just like a sport
Try to bite my rhymes at ""Night"" but get ""Court""
""Give Me A Break"" catch a ""Taxi"" and leave town
You might be a ""Star"" but I'll ""Trek"" you down
Rapping, it's a living and it's been one for years
""Jeffersons"" in my wallet, champagne in my glass, I say ""Cheers""
You wish you could be slick with the rhymes, don't you?
But maybe next time",Maybe Next Time

Microphone check one two microphone check one two 
Tell you what I'm gonna do 

On and on and on is how the beat goes 
So sell the British Walkers and cut the afros 
And dance till the feeling is gone in your toes 
I wear shorts in the summer Timberlands when it snows 
Sometimes I like to chill sometimes I like to mingle 
Sometimes I get the fever for the flavor of a single 
Sexy young slimmy, but not too young, though 
That's because Jimmy might end up on death row 
Now this here jam is like a special kind of song 
It's not too short, but then again it's not too long

All the way up to your last hair follicle

Yes, y'all and, it's time for me to fall in

C'mon don't be a chump, I see four and maybe five 
Live party people but the rest did not survive 
(Why?) They had a cardiac arrest 
Now rocking microphones is something I do daily and 
Making people dance like if I was Albert Alien 
People just love it when the Biz starts to play 
With my (beatboxing), and by the way

And I'm the sneaky type to like slip a girl a Mickey 
And I live the type of life that's far from affordable

Naw, but if you want, I can kick a funky rhyme 
All I need is a groove that's as smooth as a harp and 
I'm ready to talk nuff shit like Al Sharpton 
I take the stage and engage in a page and 
My name is Master Ace and 22 is the age 

[Biz Markie] 
Yo, I'm the B-I-Z M and, like a lot of women 
Bought a new car because the first one was a lemon 
Oochie Louie Findy, me and Sexy Cindy 
Riding around the block as if I was in the Indy 
Everybody pointing cause I am the joint and 
They know it's me, because I'm the B-I-Z 
Sometimes I lie in bed all day and think about my life 
Should I just kick rap and settle down with kids and a wife? 
And get a regular job where I'm working 9 to 5 
Shit, I'm the Biz and it's great to be alive 

[Master Ace] 
I'm making crazy hits, a winner never quits 
So those that used to diss me in the past are having fits 
But I just sit back and kick my feet up on the table 
Cause I'm able to rock a crowd without a cable 
Or a Cuban Link and (Yo, Lincoln wasn't Cuban!) 
So I still produce Def Jams like my name was Ricky Rubin 
M-A-S-T-E-R and this ain't store bought hip-hop from a jar and 
It sure ain't Stephanie Mills playing Dorothy in the Wiz 
It's me and the Biz 

It's me and the Biz [x4] 

[Master Ace] 
I'm a 100% proof and rag on the roof and 
Pulling crazy cuties without a gold tooth 
Wilding, styling, this land is my land 
(You're a) prisoner to my music like you was on Riker's Island 
A slim, soft-spoken brother from the ghetto 
My name is Master Ace and I thought that you should know 
You run your rhymes like a horse and force 
Extra booty lyrics on the crowd like you're the boss 
I think you'd better keep them to yourself 
Do it for yourself, put your lyrics back up on the shelf 
Now I'm going to pass it to the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E 
'Cause I know you want to see him 

[Biz Markie] 
Ah one two, one two, this is what I'm gonna do 
Keep the place jumping, get it wild like a zoo 
If anyone can do it, the B-I-Z can 
Peace to Marley Marl, Tagedy, and MC Shan 
And my cousin Cool V and, TJ Swan E and 
The Jungle Brothers swinging from a tree and 
EPMD and, Nice and Smooth B and 
MC Craig G and, Just I-C-E and 
The list goes on and on and on and on 
I go to Dapper Dan or Bennetton 

Hey hey, I got some shout outs, I know you all bought my new album 
I know everybody in Brooklyn bought it 
Everybody in Jersey bought it 
Everybody in uptown bought it 
Eveerybody in Philidelphia and California and Florida bought my new album 
I'm Biz Markie, I'm down with my cousin Cool V, TJ Swan, Marley Marl...",Me and the Biz
Masta Ace,"Yo we gonna do it now?
To get ahead, in life
I must avoid the rain, pain, and the strife
I have to keep (people) striving
I want to be among the young that are surviving
So I go and get a job and
Work amongst the jerks that I used to be robbing
My boss' name is Rick
The kind I used to vic on the ave with a stick
Now I'm taking orders
Dreaming about the days when I went to Latin Quarters
Me and my batallion
Scheming on the kid with the link and medallion
Rolling with the rush
Anyone that stepped in the way got crushed
But that was then, this is now
And I don't want to join my best friend
Cause he bit the dust
Went one-on-one with the kid and got bust
I can still see the blood
Pouring outta his head, red like a flood
I stayed up til dawn
Cause I knew, that it was time to move on

	""Keep moving, keep moving on"" ""Moving oooooooooon"" (Repeat 4x)
Hot summer night
Rolling on the deuce just looking for a fight
Take a few flicks
As they walked past we harassed a few chicks
I snatch her by the arm
Her man's up the block so she screams in alarm
But we don't give a fuck
He's wearing pennyloafers so we know he's a duck
Try to play hero
And catch a bad one you nerd-looking zero
Pockets are bare
Stetsasonic and Dougie are up at Union Square
Let's take a ride
Even though that we know that we can't get inside
Standing out front
On the prowl, on the hunt
Who's it gonna be?
Some kid rolls up in a 300 E
Uh oh, time to wreck
Diamonds on his wrist, his fingers, and his neck
Sweat on my brow
I wish I knew then what I know right now
Cause now I'm reborn
And I know, that it's time to move on

	""Keep moving, keep moving on"" ""Moving oooooooooon"" (Repeat 4x)
 Here's the break
 This is the break

My man Dre waves his fist
To the crew that means no assist
So he stepped
The kid was at the phone booth, yeah he slept
It was simple
Dre just hit him with a blow to the temple
Then he fell
The girls that were standing in line start to yell
The kid's out cold
Dre's kinda bold, he's putting on the gold
Then another yell
The crowd starts running and I wonder, ""What the hell?""
The kid on the floor (Watch your back!)
Came to now it's his turn to score
He had a gun
Pulled the trigger before Dre could run
Then he jumped in the Benz
And he jetted off, we had no wins
These days I think
As I hold the cup of success, Dre would never get a drink
Cause that night a very clear picture was drawn
It was was tiiiime to move on

	The music man (Repeat 4x)
I am the man, but I'm not the one with the can in his hand
I'm down with a different kind of street band
And I appear from place to place as the Music Man, AKA Master Ace
Stacks of flyers are pressed up
All the part people are home getting dressed up
Just to hear the sound of the underground
Fusion, and the bass like thunder pounds
And so they pack the show just to see
He who claims to be the Music Man

	The music man (Repeat 4x)
It's about time for the music man to rip
First I take a sip, then I like grip
The crowd tight into my hand with the loud
Intro, then throw lyrics from a cloud like Zeus
I'm the one to get the ladies loose
Baby, you just got seduced and juiced
By the Master Ace, I'm not a villain from a place
In the West, that was just the was I was dressed
And so, looking for lust I stand
I got girls, but I would never bring sand to the beach
Each and every person give a hand
And swing with the capital A, the Music Man

	The music man (Repeat 3x)
I bet you thought the Music Man would take a short
I fought tooth and nail to prevail in this sport
So lend me your ears, my peers because here's
Who doesn't fear another because fear's
In the mind, so don't try to scare because you might find
A chair thrust upon your back with the wack
So there, I put you in your place with haste
Now flee, cause now you can't be Master Ace, the Music Man

	The music man (Repeat 8x)
I'm here to reach the youth
The only way that I can to that is to teach the truth, so I do
Some used to diss and dismiss this
But then many of those small minds grew
To understand the mission of the Music Man
I know the time, and I clock dough so I'm grand
But I'm not a father, no I'm more like the sun
Shining down on every single one
So run, run and tell em all
Yell it from a wall, the Music Man will never fall
Or fail, raps tip the scale to get you hot and
I wear cotton, I don't bail
Or pick, I like to kick raps, hape, you have none
So quit, gather round, hear the sound of the man
Cause I can, yes you know I can, yes I can can
Satisfy with the fly display, this may dismay
But I am, the Music Man, yeah I'm the Music Man

Masta Ace,"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.  Sorry to bother you today.  My name is
 Joe.  And, um, I'm not on crack, I don't do drugs, I'm just trying to get
 something to eat.  If you can give just a penny, a nickel..a dime, a
 quarter..anything will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time...
 and have a nice day.
 
  How do you do?
  I'm from the other side of town
  The place where the only skin you see is the color brown
  The sun never shines in this place where I live
  And it's hard to do right when you feel negative
  I have no compassion
  I only know agression
  And there is nothing great about this opression
  People I see on TV, in there towns live the good life
  But I live out of bounds
  Where nobody comes unless they're forced to come
  In school, they call me the bum from the slum
  But they don't know
  My sista has no food to eat
  And her hand-me-down shoes are too tight for her feet
  The way I see things, life isn't fair
  So I never learned how to share or to care
  But to hope - and hope
  Instead of feeling down
  And that's how it is
  On the other side of town
 
 I live on the other side of town
 
  Pardon me, brotha
  As you stand in your glory
  I hope you don't mind as I tell the whole story
  Some people livin life like fun in the sun
  But yo, others are givin strife, and that's all they know
  I feel no comfort in talks from the President
  So put back on Cosby
  A shack is my resident
  I think if I ever die, it might be a blessin
  Some say I never try, but why are they stressin
  I'll never get ahead; my raps have a better chance
  I'm livin on Wonder Bread with holes in my leather pants
  I'm not on the drug scene; they call me a crack head
  I just had a bugged dream that I was a black man
  Workin in the hospital
  Then in came in a half-dead rich bitch
  Yo, they must be insane
  You think I would save her?
  Yo, she wouldn't save me
  I asked for a quater once, and guess what she gave me
  A fuckin penny
  A ?quarter? costs half a mill
  If it's up to me, yo, she's pushin up dafodils
  In a casket
  Payback's a female dog
  Yo, send her ass to the morgue
  Then I woke up, and I sat with a frown
  Damn, I woke up
  But on the other side of town
 
 The other side of town
 
  My teacher's a fat man
  Yo, how can they tempt me so
  Fuck geometry, my stomach is empty, yo
  Can't you teach me to win this crazy game?
  You and I are in so many ways the same
  People tell me, but I don't believe that shit
  Why do you sell me a dream, then leave me spit?
  The truth is bare, and so is my cupboards, too
  I wonder what could even L. Ron Hubbard do
  Because my mind right now is on the brink of breakin
  Yo, look how I think
  I think I'll stick up the store with the Arab guy
  I'm sick of him anyway; his prices are too high
  Or maybe I'll start sellin Avon door-to-door
  Then pull a jammy, and make a bigger score
  Nah, maybe I'll start sellin dope for my cous
  Then I could drive the same car he does
  The life of a poor man
  Consider me desperate
  I sleep in a cold room
  And wish I could just get
  A piece of the pie
  Is that asking too much?
  I can't even reach what others have in their clutch
  I wish I could go on, but I have to end this
  And get back to livin a life that is winless
  There's no use swimmin, so I might as well drown
  In my sorrows
  Cause tomorrow's the other side of town
 
 The other side of town

Masta Ace,"I got something I want y'all to do
Take a look around

Take a look around, take a look around and ask yourself: Why?
See all those people on the other side of town, livin large and postin high?
Take a look around, see that bumrush to this liquor store?
He sold out of Thunderbird, but I got to say more
Take a look around as the wealthy and rich
Go to plush parties and do-si-do together, ain't that a bitch?
Cause they're movin on while most of us sit back complainin
Bout, ""Ain't nuff opportunities for our people"", like it's always rainin
But take a look around, cause I see plenty of sunshine in the sky
Maybe next time, instead of complainin, you go out and get a piece of the pie

Take a look around 
Take a look around

Take a look around as more young people take their eyes off the prize
See my man Simon talkin bout he's gonna put a kit
And a rag-top on that 560 S-E-see he buys?
Take a look around at the music man on the corner playin his sax
	Fillin the air with jazz
He's a one-man symphony, see that 2 dollars in change in his hat? 
	Yo, that's all that brother has
This is just a little letter about the situations we live in
Take a look around and realize: to succeed we just can't give in

Now take a look around
Hey brother, take a look around
Hey sister, take a look around

Now money made is not necesserally money earned
But those who earn money seem to have a lot less
And not very often are those tables ever turned
But then again, money's not a measure of success
The power of 3, you see, is ever present
Slide and ride this groove, to get the meanin
Only a true king can call someone a peasant
You hold a microphone, but for a throne I find you fiendin
Pursuit of happiness and money are not the same
There is some overlap, but they're still separate goals
Because it's possible to have one without the other, a shame
Some don't realize it, so they sell away their souls

Take a look around 
Take a look around

As I walk through Grand Central I see so very many
Brothers and sisters that are down on their luck
Is there really pie, and they just aren't gettin any?
Or is it cause they're lazy and they just don't give a fuck?
Walkin through the park I see Bam-Bam playin celo
4-5-6, Bam just lost 3 g's and a kilo
Who says they only play for kicks?

Take a look around 
Take a look around

I remember Jackie, when Jackie was a hottie
Jeans used to fit her like the skin upon a grape
Me and every other brother fiened for her body
But she's smokin, so now look at her shape
Now Mrs Green goes to church like every single Sunday
And she had three sons, Ron, Mike and Dale
Maybe if she'd done a little bit more than just pray
Ron wouldn't be dead, and the other two, they wouldn't be in jail
I remember Mr. Tee, he used to walk with a limp
He had a wooden leg, why'know, cause he lost it in the war
Maybe if this country had made some attempt
To take care of their veterans, Mr. Tee, he wouldn'ta have to die poor

Ace and Action
Steady Pace by my side
The name of this one here is Together
This is goin' out to all those who some day reach that fork in the road, you know?
Cause we all have the potential to get there together
Listen up

I got a problem, the Ace is bubblin'
Physically I'm fit as a fiddle, but somethin's troublin'
My mind, I'm in search of the find
A style that's designed just for this kind
Of a raid, it's a must to get paid
Or fade into the whack parade
And so you can't wade
Through this groove, it's as deep as a diver goes
As I proceed, the liver it grows
Then it reaches your ear, teaches you where
You are and where it should be, to each his share
Unadultared, dope, I made it to cope
With any that hope that I faded - nope
I'm still on the scene, kill all the mean
Stares, who cares, they hurtin' nothin', when will you fiend
For somethin' attainable, somethin' more gainable
I build and I'm filled with knowledge undrainable
It's overflowin', before long you're goin'
To find out, you kept your mind out of growin'
The way you did it, was you didn't admit it was
Somethin' that applied to you, you should bit it, 'cause
But you chose to ignore, I suppose you explore
Only things with wings and a halo - sure
You're not a saint, but you try to paint
A picture that'll get you respect, don't you know it ain't
How large you're livin', or what you're drivin'
But what your goals are, so keep on strivin'
And gainin', maintainin'
Keep your brain intact, this is mental trainin'
For the minds that have given up
Other are livin up, if you want a sip, then go get a cup
And we'll take a drink from the fountain
Of success, yo, let's all climb the mountain
Together

[Chorus]
We're gonna get there
Oh yeah, we're gonna get there
Together
Together
Together

We got to, got to, got to 
Get there together

Who's with me now, raise your hand
Need inspiration? The capital A's your man
I'll inspire you to strive a little higher
You won't tire, and not even barbwire
Will obstruct your progress, I guess
You want to succeed? Determination is what you need
Face your fears and place your tears aside
Raise your peers to the top, here's a guide
For you to follow by, try and swallow my
Food for thought, and you're short of an alibi
There's no excuses, the rhyme just spruces
And juices up a small mind, so call mine the loosest
Cause I get looser than mice in a basement
I grab the mic, and that's when the place went
Wild, Steady smiled, I didn't crack one
Not that I'm mean or that I lack fun
But the topic is serious, listeners are curious
Rappers are lerious, the Ace and I'm furious
It's not the kinda rage that makes me want to rant and rave
Across the stage like a beast in a cage, I save
All the screamin' and shoutin' for the next man
The look on my face is the proof that I'm vexed, and
I don't yell, I don't swell, I tell facts
And simply stated I made it, sell tracks
But I want respect from those who chose to
Flap your rat traps, cause heaven knows you
Made a mistake when you chose to oppose
You tried to step on toes, now you're dissed case closed
Cause like it or not, Action is gettin' there
So keep on sittin' there, riffin' and splittin' hair
And critizisin', I got my eyes in
An upward glance, and I see us all risin'
Together

[Chorus]

Listen up
Who says a brother can't get his with his
Eyes on the prize, realize that it is
Highly probable that someday he will
Believe and therefore achieve, but we will
Keep an eye out, cause he might try out
A quicker way to payday, but I doubt
The brother knows: the harder the wind blows
The faster the quick cash goes, and I suppose
Gettin' paid everyday means improvement
Bust the movement on the floor as the groove went
(Together) as the bass kicked, the Ace picked
The mic up, and now I'm gonna strike up a taste licked
By a licker and bitten by a biter
Sucked by a sucker, I fought like a fighter
To get the meal rarely barely shared by
A brother of color, but I'm not scared, I
Don't want to stop, to the top it's a rat race
Or should I say rap race, I want to get that taste
My mouth is waterin, who's that orderin?
The Ace'll slow a pace, I'm almost borderin
On breakin, cause it's there for the takin
And I'm not fakin, yo, I want the bacon
But I'm not hurryin or worryin, there's time for
Me to get mine, but I made a rhyme for
To use, so you score, it's more like food for
Empty spaces, now the Ace is in the mood for
Seein the black with a tack with a feather
Cause we don't need a 2x4 just to get there together

You're only as good as your last jam, it's true
Your shit's new, everybody wants an interview
But then, oh how quick they forget
With no hit, they like ""Who's that?"" They full of shit
And straight up, my patience is starting to wear short
I'm gonna land blows like your head was an airport
Say cheese you theif, let me see your teeth
Cause I'm Ultra-magnetic, magnetic like Kool Keith
So abra, cadabra, presto and change-o

Cause I put my foot in Gladys, cause I thought she wore my Nikes
And I just might fuck your wife, cause I'm livin trife

It's the masta ase honey better chill and catch a smack
To the left check (uhh) if you speak freak watch your mouth
'cause I'm gettin play all the way down south
And I got the dope, new, off...
...beat style, and you got beef well make stew
You hold the bowl and I'll do the pourin
Rhymes are abundant like shells on the shore and
Three little pigs made a song out of sand
The big bad ase'll blow them rhymes down man
'cause yo I'm not a sailor and my name is not barnacle bill
But I run game like a carnival
Don't try to flex or you'll fall like September
Still got a posse just add another member
Lord d [the d stand for digga
Rollin' wit umdada masta ase is my nigga]
Punks better slow down and check the speed limit
Get too much light and I'ma dim it
So yo bust the flex and turn in your text
To chapter four, and let me break down the law
I stay away from sluts got respect for my dick
And st. ides'll probably kill my ass just as quick
Original the style and, rhymes in a pill and
How many brothers do I know on rikers island?
One two three four five I'm losing count
But no matter what the sum it's too big of an amount

Yessir you'll get torn and, worn in, contents under pressure
I got magic in my johnson like potion
Try to play me ashe you'll get rubbed like lotion
Must to blow your trouble with the see-cypher power
In cali they call em one time they be gafflin every hour
Which means they be knockin, goodfellas say a pinch
The skins are too tight, baby doll I got the wrench
I like the lowriders with the daytons nice and shiny
If you in the west you got the best you get the heiny
On the other hand uptown at the apollo
Chromed out with no tints and hammers make em follow
But I never get, I say I never get too caught up
Because I know easy come easy go
Nuff respect to the women with the job skills
Not trying to find them, a man to pay the bills
Cause I'm not the one to play piggyback
So take the crack between your legs and find another attack
And just that, mentality alone
Keeps me a healthy happy home, the mad wunz

If I gave em to my posse, they'd probably drink em all
But I don't want a murder, and I never heard of your

And leave on the midnight train the midnight to georgia

Hey mate, the playmate of the month's not the one
That I pursue, though on low she would get done

It seems insane, but I gotta maintain

I can feel the pressure on my brain
Feel the strain
But I gotta maintain

[Chorus]
Workin' hard may help ya maintain
Be able to maintain
Be able to maintain
Workin' hard may help ya maintain
Be able to, be able to
Be able to maintain
Workin' hard may help ya maintain
Be able to maintain
Be able to maintain
Workin' hard may help ya maintain
Be able to, be able to
Be able to maintain

Lord Digga
Back in the days I use to do a little dirt
Now that's comin' back around, and man it hurts
To see everbody gettin' on
But I got to wait cause of the things I done wrong
In my life, I regret it
But the man upstairs won't let me forget it
Everytime I think of doin' somethin' right

Masta Ace,"[Man]
Do you ever sing a little song like this when you get up in the morning?

[Singing]
Dear diary, what a day its been
Dear diary, its been just like a dream

[Masta Ace]
Aiyyo Ace, don't tell me your thinkin about a return
I'm kinda concerned, when will you old cats ever learn?
It's time to hang it up when you stand on your last leg
when you don't right on the reg' and your future is past dead
I'mma tell you cause none of these cats will
You can't still try and rely on your rap skill
You ain't got nothin behind you and believe me
not a label out that gonna find you and want to sign you
Write your rhymes in the shower, you washed up
If there was a law against wack shit, you'd be locked up
These cats in the game pretend that they your friend
but as soon as you walk away, they talkin about you again
Half of your old group don't like you and want to fight you
and even made songs about you to try to spite you
Big Beat dropped you and said that you can't sell
and they ain't had a hit since before Pac was in jail
It's like the shit is up under your nose and you can't smell
hell, you probably older than Blu Cantrell
You can't tell? It's over, captial O-V-E-are
and that's just in case you can't spell, c'mon

[Chorus]
Dear diary, what a day its been
Dear diary, its been just like a dream
Woke up too late, wasn't where I should've been
For goodness sake, what's happening to me?

[Masta Ace]
Yeah I heard all of your prayers but I doubt that God got 'em
So break out the suits and ties, and the hard bottoms
and get yourself a job with a desk in a nice office
and learn to enjoy all of the garbage that life offers
And don't ever again show your face on the stage
or write the name Masta Ace on the page, kid ya done
Whoever let you back in the door should get a smack in the jaw
'cause you sure shouldn't be rappin no more
You already proved that at the Lyricist Lounge affair
tryin to battle with rhymes you wrote on the way there
Maybe next time you'll know not to play fair
Say your best written shit and school 'em like daycare
But through the sad mess and all of the bad press
I can't recall a time in the past when you had less
Ain't nobody out there who gon' keep it realer than me
We one in the same sincerly, your diary

[Chorus x2]",Dear Diary
Masta Ace,"Yea, from BK to the world. I've had enough

Now-a-days, the range ain't big enough
Moskino ain't jig enough
I'm kind of iced out
But my chain ain't thick enough
Album ain't hot enough
Label said its not enough, singing in the hook
I need to change my look
My rims ain't big enough, chrome don't shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab, but I still can't find enough
Iceberg to swerve, don't dress gay enough
No airplay, so I guess I ain't pay enough
Cristale don't floss enough
And I still ain't lost enough
Album barely gold, guess I ain't try enough
Video wasn't fly enough, budget wasn't high enough
And I ain't lie enough, about crack sales and jail
Yall feeling me like braill, well I still got no sales
Must ain't soul enough, 'cause my heart ain't cold enough
Said I was ""Born 2 Roll"", but they said I ain't roll enough
Guess I got to brag more, must don't boast enough
Ain't New York enough, ain't west coast enough
But that's fine 'cause I'm gon' focus on mine
And hoping that two-thousand-nine is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
You'll see how I'm on it, if you hung enough with me
The rap game is a book, and I've read mad chapters
And if you ask me, it ain't enough mad rappers

[Chorus]
Somebody, tell me what the deal is I had enough
Niggaz got to know it's for real

Niggaz only rocking them jewels for you to see
Like Ghostface, nigga dont front for me
Enough is enough, we gon' start calling you bluff
Watching your moves, we gon' be, all in your stuff
Fuck around then come through rocking enough ice
Looking nice in high price, niggaz is nuff shiest
Guess it ain't enough thugs, enough drugs on the streets
And niggaz ain't busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians, no one stresses
Project girls rock vesses, not dresses
Enough lessons learned, play with fire burn
Enough dough get made, not of it earned
Enough wildin', fuck that yo, enough smilin'
I rep Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island
Queens plus the BX, not enough teks
Not enough cops, killing us all for paychecks

[Chorus]

Enough if this, enough of that, enough crap
Enough wack radio stations set enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if there's enough niggaz on it
When we get in the house, it's like its haunted
We got you shook, mad niggaz from the Brook', look
Enough cats with crack moes and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these, enough of those, it never slows
It just grows, your girl don't wear enough clothes
These no-brainers, are lost entertainers
They found on billboards, greatest sale gainers
Enough beans and Benz, enough fly honies  with dime friends
That want to juice you for you ends
It's getting rough, a whole lot of intricate stuff
Mad crime though, like McGruff, enough's enough

[Chorus: x4]",Enuff
Masta Ace,"[It's the way I hold you (x7)]

[Masta Ace]
I will never forget the day that we first met
I wasn't even feelin you then but worse yet
I was all up in the mix with one of your friends
and when you seen us you would always give me one of your grins
like if I only knew what I was missin
I would quit kissing on this chick and change my position
I really thought you and my man was a better match
I never thought you was the type that I could catch
I used to see you out in the park with different cats
them big willie types that rocked them pimp hats
had every other guy on the block trying to get you
wishing that they had that rap to get with you
felt you was out of my league
its like if you was silk and linen then I was fatigue
I never would have pictured you and me together
but its like the way I hold you we was meant to be together
come on.

[Chorus]
[It's the way I hold you (x8)]

The way I hold you it feels so good (yeah)
I don't ever wanna let you go(a-ha)
can't see you with nobody else, (no)
I just really had to let you know,(yeah)
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you

[Masta Ace]
Now I spend most of my time just being with you
early on I was afraid to be seen with you
cuz I knew cats would do anything they could
to stop us from being together, its all good
they was mad cuz I got you and they didn't
some even tried to approach me I'm not kidding
had to be ten times I got into a fight
with niggas tried to say I wasn't hitting it right -
They kept on hating just kept on waiting
hoping that we'd break up but we kept dating
never knew it would be so hard to be with you
I should make it easy on my self and just quit you.

[Make it easy on myself x2)
I need to make it easy on my self
Yup, I need to make it easy on my self
Yup, I need to make it easy on my self
and just leave you alone

No Wait! When I hold you if feels so great
I realize and recognize that you're my soul mate
Its us forever had to let you know
its like I told you imma hold you never let you go
come on.

[Chorus]

[Jean Grae]
One-Two check it
you should have known from way back I tried to amp you
try to speak on your skillz when other niggas felt me
but you know that if you wasn't with me they can't even hear you right
and if you try to snatch me up it'd probably turn into a fight
I been through my phases with cats and shakes
I know you seen me chillin' with fake players
who tried to grab me in the club and dance with me on the stage in gators
they say you just hatin
-you jealous of the money that they're makin
Peep stripper broads, thugs in golds and punks
Cats would front, get me high with all the smoke from the blunts
its not love its just lust
they always put me down when shit gets rough,
I can't do it alone, I need someone to hold me right tell me their feelings
speak on us to they boys, that's why we dealin
niggas startin rumors like we ain't chilling or split up
when you've been writing poems for me just to shut they lip up
and there's still cats who try to touch me when they spot me alone
try to tap me just to see if im turned on
but it's the way you speak to me
its like we on the same frequency
and when you hold me, you make peak
come on

[Chorus]",Hold U
Masta Ace,"Woman interviewing Ace: 
""Okay Ace, one more question before we rap this one up is:
Considering how long you've been in the game, all the places you been
and all the songs that you've done and all the cats you've worked with,
is there anything you'd do differently?
What I mean to say is, do you have any regrets?""

If I never recorded another song
If I was wrong, and nothin' I spitted was ever strong
If I never perform at another venue
If this genuine love doesn't continue
If none of my records was ever sold
If I fold, and I never see platinum or even gold
If no one ever again can recall, if I stalled
And start workin' part time at the mall
If there's no more shows for be to dabble in
No more travelin', leavin' the show in Maryland
If none of my songs that ever been never spin
In heavy rotation ever again
If I don't do a song to insight millions
Or get a video done by Hype Williams
If there's never a chance again to be seen
On the pages inside of another magazine
If the luxuries in life I can't ? or afford
If I never win the Billboard or the Source award
I wouldn't want ya pity or ya sympathy
Even if Marley never put me on The Symphony
But I gotta admit it I'm glad he did it
Its considered the first verse I ever spitted
I release I'm still apart of history
I learned the key to victory, its not a mystery
See I got alotta love for what I do in life
And after this I'm then I'ma find somethin' new in life
I guarantee ya it'll be somthin' that I really love
I give thanks for my life to God up above
That I'm blessed to have a job I enjoy doin'
And now as a man doin' what I was a boy doin'
The only difference is now I get to eat from it
I never though I would be known on the street from it
And if not one fan that shows gratitude
And if they see me they walk by with an attitude
It was still an enjoyable ride
Yeah, big up to Kane, Biz Mark and The Pharcyde
And of course to all of my past labelmates
y'all keep on risin' like the cable rates
Ay yo, Premier and Guru, this goes out to you
Special Ed and Buckshot, this a shout to you
I don't know if its the end but yo it might be
Big up to Q-Tip, Alicia Heed and Spike Lee
And everybody in the game I ever worked with
And all the chicks up in the game I used to flirt with
But if I never get another piece of show coochie
Never see no Louie Vattone or no Gucci
No more suede and linen or designer denim
No more Jeeps with 1,000 watt systems in 'em
No more sittin' on chrome with those Parelli shoes
No more gettin' my name up in the daily news
No more Lexus, Coups, Beamers and Benzes
No more Cardiae frames with colored lenses
No more chains and bracelete, and no baguettes
But for what its worth yo, I got no regrets",No Regrets
Masta Ace,"Yeah, big Strick, let's get it on
Yo, last night I had a nightmare that I was wack
Nope, I'm sorry, it's that you said something dope
Fuck it, it don't matter, 'cause I know shit ain't really like that
'Cause if you said something dope, I know somebody else probably had to write that
You on the wrong song an' I'm on the right track
I hit the cypher, and you bounce talkin' 'bout ""Strick, I'll be right back!""
What the fuck you comin' back for?
I pulled up to the front of the club and hurried and scurried up out the back door
Just in time 'fore your ass got a cracked jaw
Made 'cause I stack more, and what the Lakers sign Shaq for?
Incredible rhymer, what the hell am I sell crack for?
I'm real, you a ac-tor, I'm hot, you just not a fac-tor
You on some bound to do, I'm on some already done shit
I'll burn you with the same light you just lit up your blunt wit'
And I don't came wit' the style you probably 'bout to come wit'
You the opposite of smart feces, get it? Dumb shit
Couldn't give a fuck who you run wit'
Or them niggas you 'bout to go get
Matter of fact, go get 'em, you'll just be layin' on the floor wit' 'em
Lookin' up at me talkin' 'bout: ""Why you let the fo-fo hit 'em?
I really don't know these niggas, I just did a show wit' 'em
Went back to the telly and I hit a couple of hoes wit' em
Met 'em at the studio an' just spit a couple of flows wit' 'em
Bought a bag of dro and just sat back and got high wit' 'em""
Oh yeah, that's good to know, now you 'bout to die wit' 'em
Head straight to the pearly gate, say hi to the big guy wit' 'em
Or take it to that other level, down with the devil and fly wit' 'em
Grumble and groan, piss and moan, boo-hoo and cry wit' 'em
Atleast go home and tell his momma bye bye wit' 'em (bye, momma)
'Cause duke, I'm the hottest nigga on earth right now
And bust my gun in nine months 'bout to give birth right now
Run all up in a nigga hood and take his turf right now
Nothing's what your life is worth right now
I've been in shit for too long, it's about time I burst
A & R's ready to quit 'cause they ain't find me first
Record labels ready to shut down 'cause they ain't sign me first
So let me stop right now 'cause I know y'all niggas be dieing to be writing my verse

[Chorus]
If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve at night to the cracks o' dawn
Got girls in the back takin' off they thongs
Then feelin' that something's wrong!

If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve a.m. to the early morn'
If you seen them things then blow ya horn
'Cause if ya not there's something wrong!

I came outta rap training camp as a reigning champ
An' lay motherfuckers down just like the pain of a cramp
I won't stop 'till I see my name and my face on a stamp
And y'all still won't be able to stick me or fuck wit' me
I'm 'bout to leave my mark on this game like a buck fifty
Took shots but I duck swiftly, you just missed me
Fuck Alice, ????, Norton and fuck Trixie
I'ma fuck like it's my honeymoon 'till I touch sixty
You ain't a thug so don't try to get tough with me
If you think about tryna hit me, you'll get snuffed quickly
Deep down, hate Bobby Brown, but love Whitney
At times I wish it was O.J and the glove fit me
Then I wouldn't have to hear none of you wack niggas
Talk about how your crew's rich and you stack figures
In my hand's a chrome gun with a black trigger
I know you think your shit's big, but I pack bigger
Just ask your wife, 'cause I blasted her pipes
If I tell Strick to pass me a knife would you ask for your life?
You's a pussy, I can tell by your song
Homo/thug rapper, I can tell by your thong
Got sugar in your tank, you probably shit syrup
The world's about to see what it is when I hit Europe
And when I come back on for my birthday
I'ma do another video, too explicit to play

Niggas fear me like the fear of Aids
I take out pretty boys wearin' shades
Or thug niggas with they hair in braides
Then fuck yo' girl through that thing she wearing
Get her pregnant to leave that bitch a single parent
Got mad cars, you probably apin' in a Jaguar
Drunk at Justin's, while you hang out at a fag bar
Scared at jail, but at home you tryna rob
When you got inside you got sodomized by a lotta guys
Girls pile up in Young Zee room
I fucked the wives of about twenty grooms on they honeymoons
We had a check sellin' bottles of rock
An' so much dope came we re-modeled the spot
That's why y'all cats be spittin' that shit from em

Queens Bridge come on
South bronx come on
Uptown come on

Let's take a walk threw the deepest part of the hood
I want to know who it was that said it was all good
He must of never been to the corner, and spent the half an hour
Longer, where you could smell reality stronger
Where they sell you grease in a box and hope that you die quicker
And if your old enough to walk to the store you can buy liqour
Where you can find a dice game at any time of the night
And somebody gets shot or stabbed every time there's a fight
Where cats die in the blue sky in the sunlight
And ya bound to get clowned for not holdin ya gun right
By little kids with great game cause they learned to take aim
At a young age, and to allude police, with a fake name
he's tellin him, i'm Bobby Jackson from 3-be
When the fact is he's really Rashun from 4-D
Hey this is going out to your hood straight from mine
Ayyo, lets take a walk in blue skys and sunshine

Blue skys, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in a..

Overhere it's either rap hustle crack or play ball
And gats niggas carry ain't small
The cats that used to be kids when you ran the halls, is the drug lords
His broad the same chick that liked you from the 4th floor
Her older brother he the neighborhood bully
You and him cool but he keep playin ya boy cause he pussy
Where the old ladies be up in ya be-i
Callin 9-11 everytime you in the yard tryin to be high
Dice games could turn into a shootout quick
If you sayin he aced then he sayin he sixed
People waitin for the mail to get they check
And blue skys and sunshine you gotta give respect to get respect

Cause 14 year old girls be dressin like the much older
See that one chick walkin the block tryin to get paid
Is in the same class as ya sister and still in the 10th grade
And ya might see ya neighbor, down at the corner Bodega
Buyin the malt liqour in exchange for a used sega
You can even buy ya clothes on the block, imagine that
From Versace to a cool-g sweater, and a matchin hat
See this cats got a big bag of stuff that he just stole
It's the same old routine, but it never gets old
And ya might catch a cab if you live on the right block
From Black Pearl to White Top yo they might stop
They got a bulletproof partition, cause niggas draw heat
But the driver, got a bigger one, up under the seat
See cats don't really want to kill they tryin to eat

Aiyyo, its been a long time just like sweet revenge
Never thought that I'd be seen on these streets again
It's been five years at least
Waiting for a piece
Bouncing off of these walls awaiting my release
Pacing like a caged lion
With rage prying
All them days trying to engage with the iron
Stuck in between a rock and a hard place
I got down on my knees, looked into God's face
Its really not the same, is it?
With low digits
And y'all ain't hold me down, ain't paid me no visits
New cats claiming shit just like they bought stock
And y'all let em move in and take over the block
I heard y'all be out there spending dubs with em
Out all night long, going to clubs with em
I guess thats what I get for having a kind heart
Today's when they life end and mine starts

Sometimes waking up is even kinda scary
Some foul deeds I find necessary
Like the Christ and the Judas theory
I feel the hurt and scream loud but nobody hears me
My broken body bleeds heavy plus my mind is weary
Slipped the mickey when they first gave me sex
Addicted to the trees, Henneseys and cigarettes
Inhaling the toxic gases when I breath
Study words of higher deity cause him I believe
I don't pray on my knees
Just in case the evils comes like D's
I'll be ready to blast and make him bleed
In high double-digits I go back to the essence
Leave my rhymes behind so you can use em for lessons
Like a new Revelations chapter
You ain't moving slow, it's just that in my mind I'm moving faster
Sick messiah like I'm David Koresh
You done picked the wrong nigga to test
Now pick - the trey pound or the tech

Tight enough to hold the crowd, control the loud

Check it out, here's the scene
The nightclub, you know what I mean
The dancefloor 'nuff heads
Gucci girls, a few tuff dreds
Homeboys dipped in silky
Leather seats in the Benzes often milky
Cuban link, a lotta Moet to drink
Cash spent as fast as you blink
And all you hear is (dosidodo)

Livin' on the Upper Westside of Manhattan
She's paid, I mean bucks
She's got it made and her butler wears a tux
And look, look at the car that she's drivin'
Before we leave here tonight, watch me get live, and
Swing it, rope it up and string it
Open up and sting it
Ooh, what's up, you think I'm jokin'?
Just because I'm broke and I came here by a token?
Yeah aight, sleep and keep snoozin'
Give me a week, in her Benz you'll see me cruisin'
I'll be like, ""Yeah, what up, yo?""

Ah, Master Ace, and how are you?
Enjoy the party? Word, yo, I am too
So what's your name? Hm, that's kinda different
I must say hard to spell, I trust  Hey!
Is that a diamond in your gold front?
Cute  so is that custommade Gucci suit
Cost a lot? Damn, that's kinda steep
Oh yo, I think you got a beep
The payphone is right  oh, you got a carphone?
Go right ahead, I be at the bar alone
Hurry back, okay? hurry back

Yo, she's postin' high

Alright, alright, maybe you are right
I need to stay down off the post, because the hype
Might make me light in the head, so instead
I stay down on the ground where they frown, cause they're fed
Because they wanna live a life with glamor
They hope and hope and hope, but like a hammer
Reality shatters every single hope
So what they do, is simply try to cope
But who can be happy livin' in the state of poverty
Watchin' the next man live greater?
All he ever does is wish for a chance
Wishin' he could buy the suits and the silk pants
And all she ever does is pray
That one day she'll have a fulllink mink, but hey
They want somethin' for nothin'
You gotta work, jerk, it's not that tough, and
Wise up, rise up, and then you can size up to the fly
And wear the clothes of those that post high

(High)
Postin' high

Post high  but keep a level mind
Post high  but never live blind
Post high  but never make that
The most important whisker on your cat
Post high  but never put the next man down
Post high  but keep your feet on the ground
Post high  but don't forget your friends
While you're doin' laps in your Benz
Postin' high

Masta Ace,"Mmm hmmm, yeah
BK, Uptown, Boogie Down, Queens
It's beautiful

Listen, I got a lot to say (yeah)
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today, I have to laugh
On the real the Aftermath's kind of ill like I'm Dr. Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
It's funny how you get jaded, I just hate it (just hate it)
But this song gives a different kind of feelin'
It's a new kind of dealin', it's a special kind of healin' (uh huh)
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz? You know what it is
Positive over negative, see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster (that's right)
I rise up above
See, people still showin' me love
Get the respect without droppin' a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new ish, you can pop in the deck
It's beautiful

It's beautiful

Yeah, this is brand new Uptown still in the box
This is the Yankees, ten-nothin', killin' the Sox
This ain't huggin' the block wit' a gat in ya hand
This is on the Catamaran (that's right)
With the sun beamin' down while you sat in the sand
I feel like I'm more than a cat wit' a plan
This feels like it's more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in ya hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
That's why I stole this mic, y'all don't hold this right (nope)
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack and a glass of Henny (that's right)
Now drink it up 'til there ain't nothin' left in it
I'm reppin' it, BK, that's a definite
There's more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful

It's beautiful

(I'm wishin' on and on and on} The most beautiful thing ever
And it's here to bring terror to the bling era (yeah)
You can feel it in ya inner
It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving dinner
It's like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark (swish)
It's that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat go and use it
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down wit' Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it 'cause it brought us here
It's like a young mother braidin' her daughter's hair
It's beautiful

Masta Ace,"'New York, Big City of Dreams'
To get by, cats doing plenty of things
It's a honest hustle, but you gotta have some kind of muscle
Either it's that or you sign with Russel

'Cause nowadays an average cat can flow decent
So in your sparetime you can go to the precinct
Let me introduce you to some cats who won't shoot you
Everyday they're spinnnin their pen it's so crucial

They got kids to feed, wifes to hug
Their jobs are so strange, their lifes above
Look, my nigga Al had a store in his trunk
And the place under the dash where he store his pump

He had them white and white 'Air Force Ones' for 40 ($)
And them iddy-biddy-kiddy ones for shorty
He was just trying to survive to the session
Now he's locked up for stolen goods and gun posession

My nigga Neek had them first for cheek
He bough a too family home and excursion jeep
But word got around he was doing it big
Cops ran up in his crib, now he's doing a bit

Now Jose was making money hand over biz
He had legimated jobs with a little bit of a twist
Besides me and my man, I've known people
He sold stuff too, out of the back of home deepo

Everything from new tools to kitchen sinks
And he was just trying to get rich as stinks
'Cause now he lost his job and his morgage due
And he can't afford a lawyer, man law gets through, oooh

We were lying on skeems and skams
Just so we could realize our dreams and plans, man
This ain't America is it?
It don't take much for the cops to come pay you a visit

But do what you gotta do, fuck them laws
Life is a test you better up them scores
Listen, I ain't trying to survive, I'm trying to life
And here is some advise I been dying to give

They don't care if you sell it to inner section
Republicans run for officers when ellection
Who's in the inner section, see my pen errecting
This for my cats that just been effecting

From ground sillawats, it's down steal the spots
It won't stop untill we're down kill the cops
It's a revolution, you believe in god, a evolution
Either way dog, we need a resolution like Aaliyah

A man got sentenced to a year
And when he get out, it's another street career
It's a vicious cycle
For every kid who ball in the park and wish he might do

Listen the world don't like you, but
You better keep it moving, you better keep improving
You love my voice, ain't it deep insolvent
I'm saying fuck fame, I'm having a no-name

Platinum and gold chain, and saying
I'ma beat 'em at their own game",Big City
Masta Ace,"I'm startin' to think that my skill is a waste
Still in the race with an ice grille on my face
Mad at the world, mad at you, mad at my girl
Mad at my friends and anybody drivin' a Benz
I really hate this nigga that delivers my mail
But if I hit him they gonna send me up the river to jail
I hate my neighbors, they always askin' for late night favors
Hate indie labels, especially hate majors
I don't give a fuck no more, fuck this tour
Fuck these shows and these groupies, they all ho's
Hate these rude people stayin' all in my face
And hate the fact that Visa always callin' my place
So all you mean creditors and magazine editors
Same ones that debted us and put niggaz ahead of us
I'm a mad dog who sits in the dark
I'm fixin' to bark watchin' 106 And Park
What a mess, I guess I'm sorta stressed
Turn on the radio and I get more depressed
No wonder I'm kinda bitter
Strick told me I should quit player hating, but fuck that I'm not a quitter
Had a few cats betray me, try to play me
Bail and try to blame me, fuck you pay me
If y'all could, y'all would finish me
That's why this finger here is for everybody in the industry

When you tryin' to hustle for pay and people get in your way
That's when you ready to say ""Fuck all y'all""
When the job is givin' ya hell and pay is minimum scale
That's when you ready to yell ""Fuck all y'all""
When it's really starting to seem that people killing your dream
That's when you ready to scream ""Fuck all y'all""
I'm talkin' to you, and I'm talking to you, and I'm talking to you nigga

Yo I'm simply trying to eat ‘til my belly is fat
And I rest in the Midwest where R. Kelly and Nelly be at
Where my name ring bells like ""Who's celly is that?""
And ""Yo Strick you about to blow!"" yo stop telling me that
'Cause at the end of the day I'm still just a nobody
'Cause nobody knows me no record label chose me
But Tommy Boy did and look where that got me
A bad attitude and a reason not to be cocky
A huge debt, three lawyers, and two managers
A bullshit advance that didn't recoup the damages
A couple of singles that wasn't really chartin'
Yo Ace I got a Cherokee! ""Bow Wow got an Aston Martin""
That motherfucker got a mansion with a swimming pool
A rec room with many games and plenty women too
He prolly got his own chef and a fuckin' hot tub
I got a truck with four rims but yo they not dubs
Speakin' of nots yo, I'm not a happy camper
Not gettin' no younger, feeling like a grandpa
Yo I got low self esteem
Just like a nigga running in place tryin' to chase his own selfish dream
And fuck my girl, soon I'll be startin' to creep
She's a slob and don't care if her carpet is neat
She got a slick mouth and always gets smart when she speak
And can't cook a lick and the bitch fart in her sleep
I got a dog that don't bark and cat that don't meow
Everybody else is rich and I don't fuckin' see how
Sometimes I wonder why even bother waking up
Should just end it and give back the spot I'm takin' up

When you tryin' to hustle for pay and people get in your way
That's when you ready to say ""Fuck all y'all""
When the job is givin' ya hell and pay is minimum scale
That's when you ready to yell ""Fuck all y'all""
When it's really starting to seem that people killing your dream

They walk in the store, I love when they cop it 
Make you other rappers struggle to top it 
But this man flow with the greatest ease 
Never did care about the haters, please 
He done paid his dues, paid his fees 
He done stayed overseas, made his G's 
But now I got a wife and she bad as Halle 
Her moms is a militant, dad is rowdy 
The fans kind of act like they glad I'm outtie 
But they prolly sittin' at home sad and pouty 
You show me some love, I'ma show it right back 
I know a tight track so I throw it like that 
My limo driver's white, my attorney black 
""Show me some love"" like I'm Bernie Mac

This is for my Shaolin shooters and my Brooklyn teens 
Uptown Bronx and them crooks in Queens 
I work like a maid when she cooks and cleans 
'Cause it's about to be a wrap from the looks of things 
The game is changed, the game is strange 
The game is lame and it ain't the same 
But that's how it is, you can ask Iz 
You can ask Biz, we did it for the kids 
Listen here, this is different here 
If you got an eye for detail and efficient ear 
I won't disappear, I'ma keep on givin' 
I'ma keep on livin', I'ma keep bein' driven 
I'm down to earth and I'm close to ground

Send this one out to everybody, trying to make end ends meet
Yeah

I'm on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I, feel like I'm walking on the line
When it, seems like I'm running out of time
That's when I'm going on the grind

Ay yo, I'm trying to make my dollars double
I done found a place to fit in
For niggaz trying to get into this power struggle
I work hard on the job like immigrants
And always try to get my first half in advance
It sounds strange but the rap game is not a game
You could make a lot of money gain a lot of fame
But don't get it twisted
You could get addicted
Buy a mansion in the Hamptons, and get evicted
Now if you call me and I'm not around
I'm probably putting my grind down
Doing shows out of town
I be the manager, road manager, and call handler
Booking agent, choreographer and tour planner
I be the V.P. of marketing and promotions
Producer and arraigner, with a range of emotions
And after it all, I still gotta perform
At three o'clock in the morn', when half the fans are gone
But it's fine
Been on the grind since like '88 or '89
The game is foul like a plate of swine
Now is there anybody con like me?
Is anybody out there on the grind like me?
For everybody working nine to five
For everybody trying to rise with they eyes on the prize
I'm with 'cha, we all going through it
But yo, deep down inside I know we still gon' do it
Oh

I'm on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I, feel like I'm walking on the line
And it, seems like I'm running out of time
That's why I'm always on the grind

Yeah, I'm on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I, feel like I'm walking on the line
When it, seems like I'm running out of time
That's when I'm going on the grind

Yeah
I really feel I'm blessed 'cause I was born with a talent to rhyme
But the stress got me this close to quitting sometimes
On the crowded A train every morning
I can't wait for the day
My hustle game don't got to start this way
Niggaz think it's all good when they see me and hear my CD
And think I'm jumping in the 745 with TVs
They don't know I miss tours and shows
To go to work and pay bills and keep dough on my clothes
In the shadow of a legend so
They expect me to spit and sound like him
But y'all need to let it go
Everyday I face the crossroad of rap or drugs
Album cuts and singles and crack heads and clappin' thugs
When I'm broke my moms won't even give me a hug
But on payday I'm her baby then she call it love
I keep making my moves 'cause one day I'm a prove
I got what it take and I will not lose
Yeah

Tell us, who is this refine black queen, eyes so  innocent
Vanilla cherry scented, can I get to know you?
Let's exchange digits, slide, so we can pick it
The night is almost over, here, but she know  to the sofa
Your place, or mines, she said ""Mines'll be fine
I rarely  found the time to dine and unwind
With working full time, you know, with  school, partime
Are you listening?"" I said ""Yes, love, I'm knowledging
The ball game is on, kinda distracting my attention
Not to ignore you, I didn't  mean to bore
Just thought I'd speak lessons, strive to listen more""

How beautiful is she, to have the God Degree ready
Veggie stirred fried, with the cabbage inside
Pretty feet, pretty  hands, there she lie tanning
Bending with the sand, I docked the yacht
Stepped a shore, greeted the queen
As only a king should, unvailed the hood
Kneel as she stood, before me
She spoke softly, but as, she stood  naked
With the bow-legged stance, so sexy
Sweet temptation, look how the rain come down
Your hormones pound, you moan with passion
Uteris  contracting, time for some action
Cream rising, your breast at attention
Who is the original man? Got your quoting
Lookin' in the mirror, you ride, I hold it open
Short long stroking to death... (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

And the drama stay major, I need a genie
If you can  hold away, then come and see me
I'm guaranteed to make it rain, every spring  but ahh
I know you love me, even when you cursing me out
Waited up til the  candles burnt out
Ahhh -- please forgive me, I'm out here scrapin'
Drapin' niggaz up, stackin' and takin'
A whole lotta paper, it's gonna take years and  years
For me to express, the love elevation
The hell we go through, gives me the motivation
To get it right, makin' up at night
It's all worth the  aggrivation, black woman through you
I'mma build me a nation, nation... Gods and Earths (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Expensive chains, intensive pain from that cocaine
Condition the brain, children in strain, as I look back
Memory lane, civil and plain, it be in fame
A major part of the game, chemistry grain
Foolish kids ran when I came
Forty acres, five percent of terrain
Spark right through my vein tunnel, aim through this jungle of rain
A lot of haters wanna see us hang
But watch me bang as in Eagle/Crane
Step back, shatter your frame
Another victim in the system where he barely sustained
Forkin' in, I sold a million way, his first campaign
Sippin' rosemary cherry champagne, nigga
The young and the dangerous, water on the wrist, ice cryst'
Talk with a lisp, then I be top of your list

We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever, yeah, yeah
We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever

Check the Words from the Genius, that was written in pen
Murder gloves, hide the fingerprint, but never the sin
Ghetto prophet that's born to quote
Got the crimies, behind me, with the face on stroke
Don't provoke, trust son, that thing bust, and we roll dangerous
Who can handle us, when we rush the clubs on thrust
Yo, don't miss the lead vocalist, terrorist
Wu-Tang, a pure danger, the God hold a fort
Teach law, universal, beat down, my stomping ground
We hold courts in the streets of New York
Snort the gun powder, eyes stay red like fire
Cut the mic wire, hit a love ballad note
Pen stroke, beautiful quote, for you to deep throat
Ghetto life had to rough up in the housing
They only make 'em us, every twenty five thousand

Should I break it down so you can see this, break it down in pieces

Born to raise a hell up and bring you this storm
The only hellraiser in the world is the Detroit born
Twenty one years of tears i'm thinking back
That I'm the finished product of the making of a maniac
You see me on the next album letting my style run
I blaz4me like a gun devilish child number one,

First Verse:

Would you ride with me, even though it's suicide?
Only deal with the real, can't get with them true lies
Tellin' tall tales to your home boys and them
Chances of me believin' you, boy is slim
Can't trust words with no wisdom
Fuck him!
If you drownin' out here, must not be doin' too much to swim
Bein' down and out is like water in your lungs
Game over, time's up, out of order son
Only greedy muthafuckas get the World
I done devised a plan so tough, my shit's thorough
Only playa muthafuckas get the girls that split the wigs
And only a Mastamind can tell you what time it is

Chorus:

I'm from the D-E-T, are-O-I-T
Where muthafuckas show fear, for nobody
We there, never scared, prepare, yo posse
Muthafuckas still actin' like some hoes I see
Man some of these niggas is bitches too
And some of these niggas look JUST LIKE YOU
All this madness got me sick as the flu
You could be, executed, all the shit you do

Second Verse:

In the middle of the jungle with the wildlife
I'm throwin' a left blow, while duckin' a wild right
In the middle of war, never fatigue
For these, sharks, they'll spill your blood if you ever bleed
Don't be frontin' now, don't be the one eight-hundred dial
Come automatic like a hundred rounds
Only fearless muthafuckas, could look me in they eye
Only warriors survive, and the weak, get eaten alive

Chorus

Third Verse:

Kickin' wild by my style
Don't cut it down, do it now
I'm a statue of my body and soul, with a food dial
Control the dial, put you up on some game
Man, must I explain?
I want the World like the brain
Don't think I would digest if the city swallowed me whole
With high stakes, think about, the crap I'd unfold
To roll with the wrong clique of G's?  Nigga please
Same sucka roll around to try to get the keys
Man, how I'm gone ride with you?  Tell the truth
You jumpin' out your skin a nigga yell ""Boo""
I'm laughin' at'cha
Mash ya down, the block's passin' ya
I don't need a bitch with a dick for a passenger
3-D, I'm on some parallel level
want to see me?   Must be a dead Devil
Only crazy muthafuckas fly blind
It ain't time to front, time to rep just like a gang sign

Mastedon,"In the midst of a stormy winters night, when you're out in the cold,
Who do you turn to, to make you feel warm.
When you've done everything that you can do and it's still not enough,
Who's gonna be there, to save you from the fall.
Listen to His still small voice that calls from insideâ?¦
It will lead you to the truth that only He can provide.
Let the weight of the world be lifted by the love He has shownâ?¦
For it is finished, no longer will our lives be our own.

Chorus:
It is done, it was a miracle of love...
It is done, given to us from above.
Cause life has not meaning if we're living apartâ?¦
He came to carry all the cares of my heartâ?¦it is done.

When the world has a way of making us feel lost and alone,
Who do you turn to, to make you feel strong.
And when the path that we have chosen seems to lead us astray
Who's gonna guide you back, back where we belong.
And don't try to win what has already been won,
Because your life had been redeemed before it ever begun.
Lay down your life, let the old man dieâ?¦
You can't do it on you won so don't even try.
It is done.

When the things that you live for are suddenly gone
What's gonna happen to you;
When the things you believe in are taken.

Waiting for something you know you will never obtain
Hear what I'm saying 

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid of the thief in the night,
There's nowhere on earth you can hide
He'll free you from chains and steal you away,
Don't be afraid yield to the thief in the night

What's gonna happen to you,
When the wall all around you are closing fast
What's gonna happen to you,
When the bottom falls out from below you.
Safe from the knife, feeling no pain
You go searching for clues how to win this ridiculous game everybody is playing.

Do you hear what I'm sayin'
Are you listening

A your dream comes alive
You have it all in the palm of your hand
But it can cost you your life

It's all part of a machine
With on one in control
And something's about to explode

You gotta rise up, rise up, get excited

No one mentions your name
You are the envy o f every earnest heart
Only your past will remain
Yesterday was here and gone
What's it gonna be today?
Everytime that I turn around
Whoa! Something's in my way
But I got some news from the Other Side
And I know that I'm ready, know that I'm right

You stick around waiting for changes
With one foot out the door
Spend all your time wondering
Who your heart is really for
Now you've broken the chains, you're totally free
So take back you sanity

",Get Up
Mastedon,"She was and angel from a small town, no one knew her name
No one ever thought she'd get caught up in the game
Her momma tired to tell her, it's a cold and lonely world, yea
She was lookin' for a master, he was lookin' for a slave
He was headed for the top, she was headed for the grave
She had everything she wanted, but she had to give her
Love for all the world to see

Pre-Chorus:
There's no reason, it had to end up that way
Her heart was bleeding for someone to take her away

Chorus 1:
Oooh, she's just and innocent girl
Tryin' to be a woman in a mixed up world
Oooh, now she's a woman of the world
But she'll always be a innocent girl

She had her name up in lights, she was a brand new queen
She had a tear in her eye, as she looked at the screen
Then she thought about the past, and it happened so fast
Whoa, for this innocent girl
She headed out of town for the weekend with a friend
No one ever knew she was headed for the end
They found her on a bed, a revolver in hand
Oooh, what a tradgedy

(Pre-Chorus)

Chorus 2:
Oooh, she's just and innocent girl
Just a little girl in a grown up world
Oooh, now she's a woman of the world
But she'll always be and innocent girl

That didn't want to be a small town girl
Oooh, now she's a woman of the world
But she'll always be a innocent girl




",Innocent Girl
Mastedon,"In this great city, you don't hear church bells ring
Everybody dances, but nobody sings
And in the winter, there's never snow on the round
As I look out my window at the rivers of black
I wanna get out on the at highway and never come back
I set and wonder, has it all passed me by
Islands in the sky

Skyscraper temples way above the clouds
And a streetcorner preacher, shoutin' out loud
Nobody listens, and nobody cares
But everybody needs a dream
Everybody needs and island in the sky

Chorus:
Islands in the sky, Islands in the sky
Make a young boy's dreams, make an old man cry
Islands in the sky, Islands in the sky

(Repeat Chorus)

Someday I'll be there, I just don't know when
It's so far away now, but it won't be then
I don't know, I don't know
But everybody needs a dream
Everybody needs and island in the sky

(Repeat Chorus)




",Islands in the Sky
Mastedon,"Ashes are falling like rain, down to the ground
And the flames make the black sky look red, like blood all around
And sirens cry out and give fear to the night,
As victims they lie in the wait
Like a prisoner sentenced to die, awaiting his fate
The expressionless face of the people, it's riddled with fear
And the pendulum swings to and fro, our number draws near.

Chorus:
It's a jungle, it's jungle out there
It's a jungle, it's jungle out there
(Repeat)

Please mister please let me off, at the end of the line
'Cause the price that I've paid for the ride, will cost me my mind
The streets they are filled with signals and signs,
Telling me which way to go.
Don't ask me which way I'm headed, I don't know.

(Chorus)

Don't let me fade away, please hear me when I say
It's a battle of big and small, Lord catch me when I fall.

(Chorus)




",It's a Jungle Out There
Mastedon,"This world is goin' crazy and I'm ready to scream
Feels like I'm about to come apart at the seam
O my vision gettin' hazy and it's hard to see
I can feel this power taking over me

And I just can't stop it, I just can't stop it, 'cause I love it

Chorus
When your love gets inside of me it fills me up
Like the air that I breathe, I can't get enough

I got love inhalation, I can't catch my breath
I get complete intoxication from you
I got love inhalation and I can't hold back
I get the sweetest suffocation from you

I woke up in the night in the middle of a bad dream
I sat up in my bed and I started to scream
There flames in the house and fire everywhere
And when I opened my eyes only you where there

And I can't stop runnin', stop runnin' from what I need

Where your love gets inside of me it fills me up
Like the air that I breathe, I can't get enough

I got love inhalation, I can't catch my breath
I get complete intoxication from you
I got love inhalation comin' from your fire
I get the sweetest suffocation from you

Fill me up with you love

(Repeat Chorus)




",Love Inhalation
Mastedon,"I look around, my life stands before me
I hear the sound, of words that will restore me
Guided by the vision of the truth that will abound
Having assurance of knowing you
Of seeing your face, and the warmth of your embrace
Sitting at the right hand of God
All my hopes and dreams they stand in front of me
As I gaze upon the Savior's glory
Reaching out and touching his hand
To know the world that I must leave behind
Is a grain in all the sands of time

I see the light, the truth can't be denied
I know, the love the kingdom will provide
Far beyond my expectations is what has come to be
All that I've waited for, has been there all the time
Waiting patiently
And now it is known, as I kneel before the throne.




",Right Hand
Mastedon,"Far beneath the raging sea
On the ocean floor
So many ships, are lost eternally
With no light to guide them
To the safety of the shore
They go down for evermore
Beneath the unforgiving oceans roar
Only light can save them
Will you shine again to night
Lead them safely through the night

Shine On, shine on
Through the darkest night, shine on
Shine on, shine on
Till the morning light, shine on

Let your guiding light keep shining through the night

Though your warning often goes unheeded
Though there are still many lost at sea
Let your light to shine
For the few who seek to find their way to safety
Form the deadly undertow that lies below
Those who seek will follow
Lead them safely to your shore
With a light they can't ignore

Shine on, shine on
Through the darkest night sine on
Shine on, shine on
Till the morning light, shine on

Let your guiding light keep shining through the night
Shine on, shine on
Till the darkness hides, shine on
Shine on, shine on
Don't give up your fight, shine on, on me




",Shine on

'Cause I'd been away much too long, you'd been

Then you laid your hands on me
Then you laid your hands on me

'Cause this is the day of our reunion, I've been away too long
This is the day, the morning after
'Cause you laid your hands on me

Well I knew it all along, that there would come a day
I was never really gone, I just lost my way
Now the sun is shinin', there's a new day fallin'
If it takes forever, you will hear me callin'
If it takes forever, if it takes forever
If it takes forever, if it takes forever
I want you so badly

Vamo' a echarle ron a la chambola
Si no resuelve, el tiempo lo disuelve
Formemos un party encendido pa' ver si vuelve
Dile que me observe
Y que me conserve
Sabe que conmigo toa la noche hara full server
Que me responda, que agarre la onda
Yo lo que quiero es que vayemos a otra ronda
Que se disponga, que no se me esconda
Que si nos vemos toy seguro que se monta
Dile que conmigo nunca le dio de una monga
Nos bebimos un cuarto de mama-juana en caÃ±Â¡Â Â§orda
Al que le caiga el sello que se lo ponga
Tan molesto porque le saque la ronda

A 211 in progress
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that the police can't arrest 
I'm going crazy, kickin' down doors 
Breakin' in homes, and with my nine, I'm robbin' fuckin' liquor stores 
I'm droppin' things on you punk ass bitches 
From the streets and I keep 'em all listenin'
Suckas tried to play the P in nine-one
I came with fuckin' rhymes like a shotgun
I'm breakin' 'em like bouldas 
A million plus fans and mother fuckas I told ya
That the P would come through like a bullet 
Cock the mic like a gauge, grab the handle and then pull it
Don't give a fuck about the radio nigga 
Gangsta lyrics that make my mother fuckin' partners bigger
I roll around town four niggas deep
Bumpin' shit like fuck the police
See I can never fuckin' sell out
I was born in the ghetto, so the ghettos what I talk about 
One wrong move in the game and your fucked 
And if I think your going do me, I'm gonna shoot your ass up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 
Shoot the mother fuckas up 
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 
Shoot the mothe fuckas up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up      
Shoot the mother fuckas 
Shoot the mother fuckas up 
  
[Master P]
a lot of labels try to play in nine-two
They didn't really think the P would come through 
And niggas just dissin'
Now I went big time, I got 'em all ass kissin' 
I roll in the Benzo, sittin' on Lorenzos
Now the same record company's at my window 
I guess they want to talk, talk about what 
Heh, makin' me a star 
Well you gotta pay me
Cause to the Underground alone I done sold hella tapes 
Thanks to my hookup, my concerts are booked up 
The same companies mad they over-looked us 
Thick ass contracts to get a nigga stuck 
And then my lawyer say you ain't legit, I gotta shoot you up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 
Shoot them mother fuckas up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 
Shoot 
Shoot them mother fuckas up
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot the mother fuckas 
Shoot the mother fuckas up
  
[Master P]
So I refuse to get paid like them other dummies 
Sellin' hella tapes and ain't makin' no money
You see I gotta fuck 'em up
I started my own company, that's how a nigga fuckin' came up
Lookin' for district bitches 
But like my homie SKI it ain't nothin' but prostitution 
So I refuse to get fucked like a hoe 
That's why a nigga make shit for the god damn streets bro
Now the underground I rule 
Success came fast but I done paid hella dues 
a lot of rappers try ????, like sayin' they in jail, to make they tapes sell
Or poppin' that nasty shit 
Show some pussy on the cover, and talk about eatin' a bitch 
But I can never just stunt
I make that hard-core shit that niggas want to pump
I'm puttin' hits on niggas in the rap game 
I'm takin' 'em out just like the fuckin' dope game
You run up on P pump your pressin' your luck
I pack a nine cause I just might shoot a nigga up 
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 
Shoot the mother fuckas up 
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
Shoot 
Shoot the mother fuckas up 
  
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Yo P, what
Shoot them mother fuckas up
  
[Master P]
Yeah niggas you better break your mother fuckin' selves
You know what I'm sayin' 
'Cause Master P is comin' straight gangsta hard-core 
With this Underground shit for the nine-two 
You know what I'm sayin', we shootin' niggas up this year
I got my partner Calli G close to me 
Silkk, see-Murder, Fonzo, Sonya see, SKI, and CMT in the mother fuckin' house 
With this laid-back ass dope track 
Check this out, we straight killin' mother fuckas this year
So you can take it how you want to you know what i'm sayin' 
You better run bitch!",Shoot 'Em Up
Master P,"[ea-ski]
Its kinda funny niggaz running up
Trying to show me much love
Cause a motherfucker just dropped an album
Now they wanna kiss ass
But hold up bitch all your getting is a luck pass
Trying to gank me for my ducket
I tried to put you down with the ski & cmt you said fuck it
Only came around when things was kinda cool
But did you really think I'd go out like a fucking fool
Oh hell no, I kept my shit tight
Now the ski & cmt is sitting on something right
Your like a gold digging bitch from the neighborhood
That's why I slide on your ass cause it makes me feel good
All this shit you talk when I'm not around
Get your crown on nigga but you still ain't down
I got something for ya'll
A nin-millimeter that will drop you to the floor bitch
Cause if I trust ya for a minute
You would have had a motherfucking knife in my back then bent it
I gotta get ya first
Cause a nigga like ? is the nigga that will fuck you the worst
Punk ass nigga kinda jocking now
You ain't down cause I trust nobody

[chorus/master p]
I trust nobody x2

[master p]
One by one in this century
Brothers are dying getting killed
And sent to penitentary's
And your right hand man could have been a snitch
You think like a hoe you go out just like a bitch
So face 'em to the facts bro'
And end up dead like this other nigga I used to know
I guess it's kinda sad g
But it really didn't face me til the funeral car passed me
And what about them tagalongs
Them mother mother fuckers that are driving with the lights on
Could have been the killers
But nobody really cares he died on dope dealers
But that don't mean shit, cause a nigga like me pack a 9 and 3 clips
And I don't trust a soul from them nigga by my house
To them niggaz down by the store
When niggaz say they like me
That's the same motherfuckers in the game that tried to shice me
Mama say boy you have no friends, ha
I should have listened then
Dour niggaz rolled up with the ski-masks
Pointed the tech-nine out the window but they didn't blast
When niggaz said freeze p
I thought to myself, huh, this nigga knows me
But I didn't find it funny
Pulled out my motherfucking 9 when they asked me for my fucking money
But he didn't even shoot
He must have didn't have no bullets in the gun no time to think
I'm steady pullin' I blast for the driver to the passenger
Four niggaz dead in the car I laugh at ya
Now I gotta see, pull of the ski mask of this nigga that was calling me
I guess it's kinda sad, a tear rolled down my eye cause I knew his ass
His name was little peewe
That's the same motherfucking nigga I was trying to help g
Good thing I thinked fast, cause if I think a nigga gonna do me
I'm gonna do his ass, cause a bitch will get you killed
Niggaz like to steal, and ain't no thing is a good dope deal
So I live just like john montgotti, ha
I trust nobody


[chorus]

[master p]
Yeah you know what I'm saying this goes out to all my niggaz out there
In the game you know what I'm saying
You gotta keep your eyes open you know, a lot of niggaz try to get
Niggaz, and the same nigga that you rolling with could be the nigga
Trying to get you, so a nigga like me you know what I'm saying
I trust nobody I hope you nigga catch on to what I'm saying

Peace. I'm outtie.
",Trust No Body
Master P,"Oh yeah 

this dope shit done got a lot of my niggas 

taken out the game 

And to my brother Kevin Miller  rest in peace fool 



Verse 1 



Growing up in the Calliope  New Orleans to be exact g 

I had to pack a gat I thought somebody was out to kill me 

I'm paranoid I toss and turn in my sleep g 

My best friend done turned into my motherfucking enemy 

19 years old gold fronts and a mean mug 

I hooked up with my little cousin Jimmy 

learned to slang drugs 

A lot of shit done changed in my fucking neighborhood 

This fast cash got the P living no good 

I'm deep up in this shit and ain't no turning back 

Me and my cousin ?? say I got him for a fucking sack 

I told him check his bitch, but he didn't here me though 

He didn't believe that his bitch was out smoking dope 

Now I gotta stand on my own 2 

I came in this world by myself 

that's the way I'm gone die fool 

One year later and my cousin doing life on a case 

I moved to Richmond California just to fucking get away 

Bumped into my partner King from New Orleans 

He couldn't find a job and I'm back to slanging amphetamines 

And everything was cool for a fucking while g 

Til I went to this club and this fool tried me 

We in the back with some bitches counting hundreds 

Til these suckers walked up and said jack 

these niggas from the country 

We didn't have no gats, I had to make a g move 

Connects and head butting, that's how I did this fool 

King G hit this boy with a upper cut 

30 days in the county, but we didn't give a fuck 



(Chorus) 



Anything goes 

Life's a trip, but that's how the game goes 



Hood riding, homicide 4 deep with them gats cocked 

Ready to put some fools on they back 



1, 2, 3 a nigga slanging keys 

but why you have to mess with P 



Hood riding, homicide 4 deep with them gats cocked 

Ready to put some fools on they biggety back 



Verse 2 



Released from the county on a PO 

The only way to get back on my feet is slang that diggety dope 

Hooked up with my partner, my cutty mac 

Two days later I'm back rolling motherfucking black 

Lexus coup with a droptop Benz 

And in the glove compartment you'll find about 33,000 ends 

I ain't tripping cause the game get deep though 

Got a phone call, couldn't sleep bro 

They say my little brother died back in New Orleans 

Pop pop boom and it killed him, here him scream 

But I ain't tripping cause mama still here a cry 

In Richmond one day the P is gonna die 

And if I do I guess I'm going out like a g though 

Like the movie on the motherfucking Untouchables 

So when I go out, I know I'm fucking living wrong 

They betta take me out like fucking Al Capone",Anything Goes

Ghetto cheese and drug deals that's what's made us
Now I'm space-aged pimping but not Eightball
Don't make me get stupid and leave your fucking blood on the wall
Bout' to go physco, and load this rifle
I'm from the projects where we all think alike though
And killing ain't nothing but a hobby
Don't me do a fucking 187 robbery
And like some brand new Jordans, you tied up
You sound like a chicken so its time to get plucked
By a gangsta, keep one up in the chamber
Don't make me wear your ass like some 85 Wranglers
Now you all screwed up like DJ Skrew
Don't have my money, nigga fuck you and your boo
Got amphetamines for them dope fiends
Where I'm from a little town called New Orleans
But blowing up like be	-12
Niggas don't give a fuck cause they quick to send your ass to hell
The murder capital of the world
Where niggas don't give a fuck about you, your boy, or your girl
And if you come stunting on them gold thangs
I'm a have to break you off somethin'

Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin' (x3)

Let me set the shit straight, let me lay down the rules
If a bitch is talking shit, then that bitch gonna have to snooze
Pimp see bitch now what the fuck you said
AK hit the wall tore the stuffing out the fucking bed
I'm looking at dead, I'm fully auto
Tomorrow I got court, I ain't gonna go
Nigga owe me money, thinking it's funny, bought a 64'
I'm bout to pull a kickdoe 
I need mo money money mo money money
Took the keys, took the cheese, and fucked his main hunny, hunny
Now the game is escalted, cause ain't no witnesses 
To go back and tell the Po-Po's all the shit we did
I'm looking at rape, I'm looking at kidnap
But when them bitches get here you gonna be full of hot caps
I'm breaking them bitches off, putting 'em in the trunk
Riding around P.A bout-it hostages blowing skunk
Cause getting rid of enemies to me ain't really nothin' nothin'
Pimp see bitch 14-96'll break you off somethin'

Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin' (x3)

We coming down like a sail, in that goddamn rover
Just when you thought it was the beginning
You bitch, now its over
You can call on the Calvary, reinforcements, and your local P-D
They getting somewhere if they see me
My nigga that's how these G's be we three, me see and Master P
Sipping on Gin and Kiwi
Fuck popping in your CD, bitch we popping in them clips
And now we all up in your grill live in 3-D
With drama, disaster, and death when you make me have to blast ya'
Y'all has to recognize you fucking with murder masters
Who plaster your ass and make your momma call a pastor
Dying faster than you thought, now that's your ass bro
It's the class of 9 scrilla on the for real'a
Direct from the villa of killas, now who thinking they trilla'
Watch me fill a want to be cap pealer with them slugs
Probably for jaw jacking and jumping

They might look at motherfuckin Muhammed Ali
Yah know Sugar Ray Leanord, Mike Tyson, but me..

Air Jordan ain't no motherfuckin hero G
My heroes is niggas in the ghetto that slang D
That right on chrome and triple gold and pimp hoes
And take any nigga in the click to the Super Bowl
And party like it ain't nothin
But most of my homies they done died over drug money
Like Bizzy Bob and Sam Skutty but I still love em
Air full of motherfucker and I still want to hug em
Big Dave, my nigga gone to the battle field
Dandon and Levi, damn guard ya grill

Judge, god damn another nigga didn't make it back (Mr.C)
My lil brother Kevin Miller rest in peace
Elbraud, Nextditch, and Big Leaf
Lil Girl, and Boo, and Anguard
Big Pepper, God damn what y'all thinkin about
They gone, I mean they soldiers
But thets the type of cal i live up and hold to

They got bigger, the list go longer
I could start from New Orleans and go back to California
To lil Tony,to dime P
Seritz,Burnell,can't believe
That he's gone, the Scarface
Dank,Loot,and Meathead
And what about Kenny Sep
And all my niggas that dead and gone that got caught in the rep
And my other heroes still livin
But they locked up behind bars, caught up in some pigeons
Like my lil cousin Jimmy,lil Horgel
Randall,Marlow,Pee Wee damn
Another mission complete
Took off the streets locked up by the police
Meatball, and Nap, La Crowe   
Pac, jinte, the gats go pow
But my homies got caught up
Even though they had no way out the ghetto but the come up
Off the streets in the hood money
that's why my heroes live for drug money

I watched em live fast, I watched em die slow

What you mean I need a hero
A hero is a zero to me
The only hero that I know is them niggas in my hood G
They gave me the game so I enhanced the gat
Than I took the game, and ripped it out the frame
I tried and told ya
A hero can't be ya lucky rabbit's foot or ya 4-leaf clover
It all be a myth in ya mind
A hero ain't about shit if they ain't about dying
You know who was a hero to me
that nigga MoXs on the Howard J G

[Master P]

And y'all other niggas that's still livin
That want to be a hero but can't be givin
Yo life up for these streets
But this goin out to my homies out there slangin D
That still hustlin in the game tryin to make it
But y'all niggas better realize you can't fake it
You either in or out ain't no halfway in
'cause when you die in the end you go to the pen
And its realer than you real niggas feel me
This for my niggas that are heroes in my hood G",My Ghetto Heroes
Master P,"Check this out playas
All y'all gangster niggas
Y'all motherfucking gangsta bitches out there (the dope game) 
I'm a let y'all know something (welcome to the dope game)
Something that'll never end, this shit is going on like fucking numbers
Black on black crime, nigga it go like this here
We live an eye for an eye

You kill me, I kill you, my partners kill your partners
And you dead ain't no love on my spot
Me and my partners pushing rocks
Got them 17 round glocks at your ass spitting like loogies
We packing heat, 32 round clips, my automatic uzi
But I look into the eyes and I stare, I see death
Goddamn thinking ""the fuck?"", it could be me
My little homie on the ground crying
I'm thinking I'm gone, Oh my lord
My little homie Tony's dying (ripped his heart out)
He never had a chance to see his life glow
And he never had a chance to see his wife bro
And his little kid is only 8
It ain't about me or you motherfucker 
You gone peep defeat off the tree  
Cause you die and you murder, how could you live on the streets
And you never hurt, another nigga with a glock G
I'm thinking about Tic-Toc Boom, there goes another one
Send him to the moon
Ain't no rocket ship bitch, it's the temple of doom
I mean the ghetto, cause it's wicked
Most niggas out there in the hood, trying to get a chicken
But never even seen a bird
They die for that cain and that weed and they water
And they to fucking high, to see the enemy
Niggas that pretend to be, fools don't come close to me
Your best friend will kill you
I'm from that 3rd Ward, Caliope Projects 
Where they peel your caps like bananas
Police trying to stand on them buildings with them radars and scanners
But they can't stop the murders 
That's happening in my hood motherfuckers
Cause everybody study capping in this
Everyday, all day niggas dying, mothers crying
But y'all niggas ain't realizing that the hood is murder
Find your ass in a 6 inch gurder
Cause niggas banging like Charlie Chan
You'd better pack a piece nigga 
And welcome to the never ending game

The never ending game, (the dope game) the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep, or die on these streets
Cause the ghetto ain't no joke
Niggas in my hood everyday getting smoked
Welcome to the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep or die on these streets

And the ghetto ain't no joke
Cause every motherfucking day another nigga gets smoked
And momma pray it ain't me
But I'm addicted to this dope game, addicted to this green cheese
I be making mail like the mailman
This is for my partners in the hood pushing massive cain (ice cream)
Through the hood of the projects
Its fiends walking up for bubble ups
You think I'm bout to reject
When a nigga get some money, I got them gats cocked nigga
I ain't living like no dummy
If I die, I ain't scared to die, but don't ask me why
Will I retire and give it up realize
That's this my only mission of money
But y'all niggas look at a nigga hustling like its funny
But I got to feed the family
Even though if that take me getting fucking scandalous G
And I have to hurt shit
Put a nigga in the dirt, mean putting in work
Lay him down, and punch in your time card
Cause you never know when your ass bout to go meet the Lord
So I live ruthless, reckless, and rangeless (dangerous)
Don't give a fuck, my clique is ready to hang shit
Off the rack, ain't no trap
Just a bunch of motherfuckers walking with gats
Through the projects and walky-talkies
Jacking shit motherfucker ungh, that's why they bark
Like dogs, watch a nigga hard
And I be slanging dope like I'm getting paid like Lou Rollins
And the white folks can't stop this
And the Taz can't stop this nigga, cause I'm in the hood slanging rocks
Getting paid cause I'm major
And if I die fucking retire my shoes and hang up my pager
And give 4 G's to my sons and kill my enemies
Y'all can't stop a nigga please, even if I'm dead G
And when I go out, I'm going out with a bang
So fuck what you heard and welcome to the never ending game",Never Ending Game

Momma, this is one thing I still can't realize
How you been so strong when my brother died
You done kept the family together tight
Thinkin' about how we gone get through this sorrow night
This is crazy, I can't sleep nope
Even though i got revenge written across my throat
Five kids and you done lost one
Never had a daddy, but put it on your oldest son
Ain't that a be	, leave me to watch the family
To make the bills get paid, you got to live scandalous G
Cause the ghetto got me pressured
Will I die sellin' dope, or would I sell a million records
Oh momma won't you feel me
Even though Ms. ?? said somebody tried to kill P
And you know your boy's sellin' dope
But all you say is watch yo back
Cause you don't want to see me go

		Momma I don't want to see you cry
		No more tears
		Cause I'm deep in the game
		Sellin much cocaine

Momma how you be so strong
Even tough the ATF, done kicked down your home
And ran right through and got me
But you still came to see me
And said that you love me
And I know that you real though
Cause when I got out, you's the first one at the door
Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand
That I'm trying to make some money
And if I die in this game, I guess that won't be funny
But you still on my side cause you a soldier
You the only friend I got and ma I told ya
One day I'ma change G
Even though the ghetto's crazy, think about your baby
If I make it out this dope game
I know that life won't be the same, momma I gone make a change

Drop the top on the Regal, shot a desert eagle

Seen Tina from the town laid her that's a dizzay
The side show was jumpin' (bumpin')
Oozin bikershorts and daisy dukes outside pumpin'
And niggas from Richmond rollin' hella deep
My little homies from Oakland got chased by the police
And these hoes want to kick it 
I met a bitch from Frisco gave me her number on a traffic ticket
And tonight I'ma page her
My niggas talkin shit bout these hoes fade ya
When your ballin they jealous they hatin'
I guess they mad cause a nigga own gold daytons
And they bitches started lookin at me
Niggas I'm trigger happy, fuck it and my ass nappy
Get more hoes than freak show 
Ask your bitch, nigga she know
But ya'll can't fade us

[Verse 1: Master P]
I remember back in the days it wasn't like that
Everybody knew everybody, now days it ain't like that
We used to stand on the corners and drink brew 
Now days you gotta duck when they drive through
Cause they blastin', life is like plastic
But who would be the next egg took out the easter basket
Is it you, me, or her or she or he? 
who would live to see the long age of 23? 
Cause once you dead and gone who gives a damn
On your tombstone would read Rest In Peace Sam  
But in the ghetto you cooked 'till you dead 
Ain't no love when you dead and gone cause you red 
Like roaches for the gutter, peanut butter
your life in the gutter , fool cause you fluttered 
With this game that I spit, shoot out, don't quit 
Now you a victim of society another statistic
I heard the gunshots rain from the middle of the street 
The gun-smoke cleared three people on the concrete
I mean it's crazy, slippin' on daisies
Time to call it quits, they done put a bullet in a baby

[Chorus: Master P and Mo. be Dick]
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be

[Verse 2: Master P]
Watch you back in the ghetto black 
Open the box, Mom's ain't nothing to eat 
Back in the day, I thought we was a family
My little brother on the street corner selling crack 
Only 15 used to be a quarterback
I wish the law would rehabilitate my auntie 
I came home try to visit that girl tried to do me
Started tweakin' said that she needed crack
Stole my grandma's rent money out her purse black
I stay Tru 2 Da Game you devils' can't see me 
I put that on my mom, I put that on my gold teeth   
My homies bangin' ,no respect for the American flag
But they kill over that blue and red rag

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Master P]
I remember back in the day smoking weed was the everyday drug
Now days they shoot heroin and sell blood 
Back in the day catchin' the clamps was gettin' us shot 
Now days catch the AIDS and your time will stop
My lil' homies doin' time, 25 with a L
A victim of the system, I'd rather die and go to hell 
I try to be legit and start my own company
Till these sucker want to bump into P
They point the finger at me for tellin' another what to do
How could another person tell you what to do
I could tell you to rob or steal or kill 
that's like pointin' the finger at Jack or Jill
For being the first person on this little earth
Is like askin' Mary why she had to give birth
And who would be the next victim to lose his life 
And who would be the next one to make a life
But when you make a life you gotta learn to teach your kid
So one day they can grow up and make it big
But all this gangbangin' and turf wars gotta cease
Cause y'all know we livin' in the last days G

One nigga on the ground lookin' like a eggo plater
But I ain't even trippin'
Gotta show them I ain't fakin'
'cause if these other niggas get me for some bacon

I started counting my dope
Everything was cool black
Headed to the front
Got them fiends walkin' in the back
I ain't even trippin'
Ain't no time to serve these fiends
I got 40 g's and two fuckin' keys
Headed to the bienz to put the fuckin' cash up
Jumped on the freeway nigga fuckin' dashed bro
Think I see the rollers behind me through the rear-view

But I ain't even trippin' 'cause I ran through clear view
Stopped at Egg-Zone tried to get some gas
That's when I see two robbers on my ass
Played it all cold
Told be	 to get that pistol
Jumped back in the bienz shoulda seen they head whistle
I went back to the house and my homie want some flour
I ain't Scarface but got the money and the power
They call me Nino Brown
Or fuckin' Frank Nitty

But if you come up short
There's gonna be some shit up in my city

Got the latest word, swerve to the side of the curb
A fiend that wanted me to serve him, I said bitch can't tell I'm off?
But I still gave him five dollars to wipe my white walls
And then I burst up out the block, dropped the top cause it was hot
Hit the spot with the most hoes at the sideshow, abouts to plot
Spin donuts, you know I'm macking, a straight up nigga
Catch me spinnin', you can tell I was there cause I clocked smoke when I was finished
I seen five-O, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin' he'd be nice and all cause I gotta 185 in the hood

1st Verse: [Master P -- Fiend] 

Master P: 

Somebody musta' told these hoes I was a muthafuckin' rapper, 

but will they jus' tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin' 

captain? 

All the bitches I done broke fo' they bank, 

I got so many cocktales I need a muthafuckin' fish tank. 

I got hoes like acorns fallin' outta trees, 

No Limit niggas don't say hoes, 

ain't no caps that be floatin' in the breeze... 

Fiend: 

Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work 

I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk. 

kepta smirk on his face, lookin' like drug swappin', 

come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage. 

Got keys to his cottage, done changed the law and the act, 

and all he get to do, is eat that funky hoe from the back. 

On top of that, 

the bitch fat!!! 

Makin' a career off this nigga, 

and all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this 

nigga, 

go figga, 

all she wanted was that man to change, 

but if it was me, I done been done slapped that bitch in the brains. 

Chorus: 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby.

Mr. Captain Kirk, I want to have yo baby. 

Verse Two: [Silkk The Shocker] 

See I met this bad ass trick, 

I mean this bad ass bitch. 

Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like buying her 

shit. 

I bought her lunch the first time, 

but see there trick that's nuthin' but game, 

I hit it one time and they be callin' back, 

talkin' bout' ""Silkk, why you do all that playin'?"". 

And she had the nerve to tell me, 

if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless, 

I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick, 

then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose. 

Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind, 

I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs. 

Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, 

a bitch might give you a buck, 

man, but since you my boy you 

better use a condom, before you try to fuck. 

Take the game from this show bug, 

'cause Silkk ain't no love. 

I give'em a little somethin', but at the end I 

take'em back and get the most love. 

And ain't no beam'em up Scotty, 

ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work. 

It all depends on TRU niggas like us, no Captain Kirk (Bitch freeze), 

all you ghetto hoes get yo' Lee Press-On Nails, fix yo' wig, 

bring yo' Bebe kids 'cause the Ghetto Enterprise is leavin' in

Master P,"And the lady America was finally slaughtered 
And divided into 3 quarters 
Her children the cities fell
Battlin' golden' platinum 
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed 
Pity was not spared for no man  woman  child or rapper 
And believe 
For his rap was felt by everyone 
And this time when trust had no meaning 
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decide to the world 
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival 
To open up a path to reality 
For some, judgement 

[Verse] 
The devil took the straps off my nigga legs 
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed 
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies 
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese 
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold 
On these streets, anything goes 
He was on the road 
It took 'em ten to do him in 
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again 
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks 
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks 
The reaper came and took him 
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him 
As I walk through the shadows of death 
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath 
The kingdom of freedom is all they said 
Why the shackle and chain? 
My homie's life slaid
From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride 
Bite the apple of eternity(uggggHH) 
Every mother will cry 

[Chorus x2] 
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends 
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end 
 
[Verse]
Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending 
Start to finish 
Losin' or winnin' 
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin 
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine 
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die? 
Now my whole life I was scared 
The only judge is god 
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws 
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill 
But I lost too many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal 
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps 
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death 
And even though I never see 
I believe there's a god 
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy 
When times is hard 

[Chorus x2] 

[Verse] 
As the sand slowly poured 
I see flashes of life 
Time started ticking it's the end of my life 
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god 
Behold no man or your life destroyed 
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom 
Big ones and small ones 
Good ones and mean ones 
As the angel came the ghetto from hell 
Some words of the piece cause they didn't know no better 
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire 
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire 
Crosses burned cause they souls was scarred 
Hoping for a second chance but ain't none 
Cause it's your final call

I close my eyes, I can't sleep, I visualize death

They'll take your life for a hundred see's

The game gets so wicked that I wear a bulletproof vest
And now I'm grown, and they wonder why I'm crazy 
Imagine feedin' tablets and beer to a baby
Never had a chance when I was 5 
Nigga took me in the car, took me on the ghetto ride
Cruisin' through streets that I've never seen 
Pull the clip off a 30 round magazine 
Taught me how to deal with a triple beam 
And ever since then I've been servin' dope fiends
I got the game in the bag that's so big
Nigga see my nuts it's like two figs
Swoll to the fullest, 
In my heart to my vein, pump nickel plated bullets

Beef with us is death wishing, I put to work because they didn't listen 
They tryed to set me up, why did they push me? 
Hook me up in the town with the killer pussy
Rap me up between the sheets
Nigga bust out the closet, but my 9 made 'em dead meat. 
I shot the hoe who set me up
I'm drivin' off mad because the niggas threw off my nut
I'm going through a thang, ain't no thang though
Cause before I left, I hit the set and took all the dope

From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall 

In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall 

In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star 

But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car 

A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried 

You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire 

Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain

Makin million dollar bets, makin all our money stretch like limos

But if I close my eyes and visualize me together 

Then I suddenly want to smile 

To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up 

You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us 

Even though you was wrong, I never could belive that that was true 

You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos 

See me and see and P forever gon be ridin and thuggin 

Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it

Niggas Die to make covers of magazines
I'd rather be unknown then dead and famous with green
The black hearse roll through da ghetto streets
I made the sign of da cross, glad it ain't me
Not fearing death, just not ready yet
two stones to my brother, may his soul rest
retaliation is a must fool (huh)
some niggas don't play by no fucking rules
in this game get so deep so we gotta ride
Mama don't trip, don't even cry
when its my time to go then I gotta leave
but while I'm here I'm gonna drink henicy and smoke weed
is there a heaven for a gansta niggas callin
trying figure out if they up there ballin
My young niggas getting paid left da earth
goddamn six feet now he's in da dirt
church bells rangin hoes sangin
my nigga's up there for gang bangin
slangin dope, pushin cocalies
got me stressin down on my knees
its a risky life wit a fast pace
but where soldiers go when they get took away

Head first in this world with my eyes impeel
unaware that these niggaz on tha streets is real
will i survive or will the cold streets shake me
will them niggas break me before the lord take me out
this son of a bitch I never want it never asked to come
trapped in a double face not a place to run
get the gun and buck it let'em know I ain't the one to fuck wit
I stuck with this rough shit
screaming tell god to make space them niggas killed my ace
and now they tryin make waste of my face
but I'm strapped up and only fifteen full of hatred
i couldn't be the next rapper faced with waste
cemetery gates all black suits and limos
family tears and flowers no more shows and videos
after parties hoes come to a cease
young thug caught one slug rest in peace

Master P,"This is a ghetto public announcement (weed smokers)
Roll your blunts tight
And light your joints
Inhale...slowly exhale
And that's how you get high.
(clip from Friday)
I know you don't smoke weed...i know this
But I'm gonna get you high today.
Cause its Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got shit to do.
Pass me da green, i need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 8 times)
(Inhale....exhale) Eyes selling red, got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoke some green with her mama.
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store.
Picked up some blunts, got ten on the 2-0.
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Got a nigga's head spinning like the seven seas.
Puff, puff, pass, nigga that's what Simon say
Fools that hog the green or da weed gonna get carried away.
Fingernails burnt, lookin like a tweeker
Ears steadily poppin, but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry, feindin' for them munchies
cause real smokers don't blow no fuckin green on empty stomachs
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 4 times).
Green trees pack wood, make cabbage
I like to get high but it ain't a bad habit.
??????? with that weed smoke comin out my lac 
Got a ??? in the front and one in the back
Blowin shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin lac at Holiday Inn
I ain't even trippin, told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady cause she know I'm ready
Choppin up weed like muthafuckin spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
cause every time i hit the weed I'm lookin for Isuzus
Pass me da green, i need some weed with my hennessy (repeat 5 times)
y'all high yet?
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my hennessy(repeat 3 times)
Damn nigga y'all chokin, get the fuck out of here nigga.
Pass me da green i need some weed with my hennessy
Nigga I said are y'all high yet?
Pass me da green i need some weed with my hennessy(repeat 3 times)
Oh, you think you trippin now huh?",Pass Me da Green

Jump in my 97 Hummer and riside
You be Ms Bonnie, I'll be Mr. Clyde
Together we be catchin g's
Flipping keys, smokin weed
It's all about you and me
Causing major pain on this dope game
You be Halle Berry
I'll be the ghetto Damon Wayans
In charge like the Lakers
You got your pink 380
I got my black nine for the haters
My homies call you that nigga
But you my bitch
Since we banging, I guess we one click
You be that nigga that I drink with
And you don't even trip if i was to let a freak kiss
You give me rubbers so I can stay strapped
You say you can't catch no fucking rat
Without a mouse trap
So we be kicking it like g's
Its a drought, but you got a connect on some keys
You roll up the ?? and drink 40s'
You'll whoop any bitch at any ghetto party
We walk past security cause you got the strap
And when my homies see ya
You the only female they give dap
You the only nigga that I'll kiss
Make love to and still do some gangsta shit with
Like Menace to Society we kick it
I'm Kane, you my thug like Ms Jada Pinkett

[Mia X]
I lays back and chill
Why you ills with the hotties
I'm numero uno in your eyes honey poppi
Yo lady Gotti
Thugged out, hooriding ready to kill
Yet make me feel like others can't with my sex appeal
Be riding ghetto thrills
But still the bitch behind the trigger
The bitch about her scrilla
The bitch to smack her nigga
If the tone faintly rises in his voice
The choice is mine
When it comes to haters living or dying
Blueprinted crimes illustrated by your baby
The unlady like mistress
Be all about illicit business
Bitches witness us together looking tenderly
But to scared to tell wifey, for fear of me
I'm only trying to be the one with the green papers
Bounce on the dick and help me pull off a mean caper
That's why you praise the biggest mama and you care
Other hoes get x'd out in what we share yeah
I give you rubbers for your friends for show
Take me shopping tomorrow
Short change them hoes
Save them 3 more nuts for me
Alize, hot tubs and an ounce of weed
Please, there's not a jealous bone in my body
Take me off to Jamaica
Then take your wifey to (aloha) Hawaii
I don't mind being number 2
You keep more ice on my hands and wrists
Than an ink blue
And if it all falls through you still got me
Yout true bitch nigga down to hustle
From plan be

Master P,"Chorus:
Look at all these haters surrounding me every day
hatin on a baller but they can't stop my pay
stop all the hatin I can't take it no more
I'm just tryin to get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for

Verse 1: Master P

Pop the lock on the benz with the keys 
To high to see his own enemies
his baby mama with him in a short skirt 
his last ride was in a car, i mean a black hearse
his friend took his life for the mighty dollar 
then ran through the alley must have been a coward
No more hit 'em up like in the old days
homies scrab with Mack 10s and AKs
that's why I roll by myself I mean I'm a loner
cause haters be all up on me
tryin to sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
and the same niggas want to blow on your weed
set you up for a caper 
don't want to see you make no money then take ya
gotta figure out how to get what you got 
cause haters be the same niggas on the spot

Chorus 

Verse 2: Master P 

How do hatin get started?
It started by the jealous people 
and they get mad over the things you have 
and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really ain't hard to get 
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors 
I'm really not impressed
I tell you only one time 
with my scrilla fool don't mess

Verse 3: Fiend

I only get with a few cause these bitch made niggas is actors
see I don't had to many gun-ins, run-ins with these ass backwards
non-packers
I'm strapped like P
or see
they ask for me 
capture me 
but I'm going out with a blast
I put that on some cash 
I'm standing last 
for some ass
y'all young crazed punks are trippin 
don't hate me nigga just go ahead and credit my ??
I'm admitting 
that I'm not only on the thwat
but I know i got stopped 
on tha ??
and its understood that I'm not 
one of the best niggas that ever lived
but I got some advice to give 
and that is

Chorus 

Verse 4: Silkk

I wonder why they hatin for?  Probably cause we got G's,
mad cause we makin moves, cause we got keys
But really I can't fade them
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you'se a motherfuckin playa
I know y'all gonna kill me in a matter of lies 
I got friend that will turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me 
when I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes up on  my enemies  I gotta watch my friends
like when I'm sittin on top or ridin in a benz
Why don't y'all go out y'all's ass up and get something 
don't worry about how i got mines
always tryin to point a finger and say that's not mine.
and kill me 
it kills me 
its digusting cause I got a few G's
they try to rob me
but they know they won't touch me
smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
but I just can't call it or catch
but i still got G's and I'm still ballin

[Chorus x4]
Throw em up if you a soldier, if you dodging these niggas, these bitches and
the rollers

The clock hits twelve, I'm on the grind
Punching your code if you want these nickles, quarters and dimes
I got the ghetto soed up like mack diamonds and windy
And I got more sealers than JC Pennies
Throw it up if you a soldier
But if you a punk motherfucker talkin shit and working with the rollers
You better duck down quick when the tank pops
Cause we be slanging automatic fucking slangshots
I went from halves, to hoes with weed to working water
From selling grams, to motherfuckin quarters
From quarter keys, to really tapes and cd's
Not every nigga in the hood knows me
Uhhhhhh, but getting rowdy
Stayin TRU to the game, and still bout it bout it

[Chorus x4
I'm a represent my hood till I die
And when I'm gone put it on the blimp and let it ride
Third ward, calliope, nigga Master P
A ghetto nigga, live and made history
ain't no mugging, just thugs with me
ain't no hugging, ain't no loving P
These ghetto heroes is dead and gone
That's why niggas in the ghetto live like Al Capone
I be breaking niggas like ice in Iceland
Crushing niggas like sevens in dice games
Nickel plated meters knocking down doors
With hoes and gators, jaboes and polo's
So watch your back when you hustling crack
Cause jackers take your life away and ain't no coming back
Uh, I seen a lot of movies, but this shit is real
And only cars get brand new grills

[Chorus x4]

[Kane & Abel]
Automatic gats for combat what we pack
Flip niggas like flapjacks, with oz's and crack
We killing with tatooes our guns and balls
The car with the tek-nine in my droor
Went from selling double up's to going double platimum
For selling crack and, jack and gun clapping and rapping
Watch me smoke my little weed, got my drink and bud
What's up to all the slangers, the bangers, bloods and 'cause
I was a soldier, I still remain a soldier
A cobra, even sold my mamma a bowl a
Down a fifty of hennesee and blow a bag of doshia
Quarter keys with five G's which a hustle for D
Now selling gold LP's, that's a hustling for cheese
G's don't give a fuck till the world blow up
Game over, Kane and Abel, no limit soldiers

Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin'
I'm gonna be real with ya, look I'm trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin'
I'm gonna be blunt with ya, look I'm trying to do something

Maybe it's the bud in me, or the thug in P
Got these ghetto hoties wanting to put they love in me
I'm a G from the CP3 and dedicated
Screaming No Limit Soldiers and these playa haters hate it
Relax shorty, hit the blunt, drop the Ruger
Come close to a nigga, let the P seduce ya
Work it like a Solo Flex, say you wanna a ruff-neck
Cristal and strawberries, weed smoking, rough sex
I want you to open your legs as wide as you could
So I can hit from the back with this nickle plated wood
Up and down like a roller coaster
From your stomach to your back
Let a gangsta poke ya
I ain't trippin', never slippin' cause I got straps
9 months later, we ain't bustin' no caps
Crispy clean, no strings attached
Little bump-n-grind, miss thang are you with that

[Chorus]

I heard you want a romance
Won't you lay up there and give me the chance
I ain't saying romance, now what you to be enhanced
I'm matured enough, and I ain't approached you for nothing
And the reason I came up off cause you working with something
Now I done had a little herb, now I done build up the nerve
On top of that my head tight from everything the boss serve
I'm pitching, cause your curves got me wanting to slide home
And prove that I flip other things besides ounz
Tel your girl you're gone, baby you gots to rome
He leaving with things, he get it on, get it on
You cold make me moan, so you up for screwing me
Please use engenuity when you doing me
Damn you ? blues with you matching hot shoes
Pretty legs but knees gone get bruised
There's no one gonna get used
?
Straight to the point shorty
Look I'm trying to do something

[Chorus]

Back stage at the concerts peepin'
You wanted me to see you and I'm thinking about creepin'
Far from home, destination unknown, rock bone
Hotel booked and I don't wanta be alone
Maybe it's the tone got me visualizing this song
Camouflage love all night making me moan
Thug passion, in the back seat ripping off your fashion
Run and tell your girls about your night with the assassin
I'm here tonight and the vibe is right
Red and blue lights are glowing over Brian McKnight
But tomorrow my flight, and I'll be outta your sight
Take my address down so you can write
But for now lets do something
Fuck the frontin' and the talking
My dogs just about barkin'
Take your outfit off and put the soldiers shit on
And go to the war with me
Pager number's on the desk
Hit me when you trying to do something

Got me deep in this game, some niggaz don't change
Have mercy on P, just tryin' to have change
In my pockets I'm knockin', the feds can't stop me
Most hoes they jock me, I got knots in my pockets
Caviar and bitches, 6-4 and switches
Champagne and riches, but cooking keys in kitchens
Mansions with marble floors, knocking off chocolate hoes
Boots with ignition, Ferraris and drop rolls
I live with killers, dealers and TRU niggaz
No Limit guerrillas, mercenary killers
Beat's by the Pound, haters get clowned
Gone worldwide, but true to the underground

Niggaz livin' for scrilla, banking with peelas

Army fatigues, niggaz straight like g's
Livin' like soldiers with g's, soldiers at ease
Slangin' fuckin' tapes like keys, swang 'em just like keys
From Richmond to New Orleans, we be ballin'
Keep them bitches down on they knees, keep 'em on they knees
Got them smokin' on our weed, but not for free

(chorus 8x)

(Silkk)
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
I live for weed to make money
Man I want so much cash when I wake up in the mornin'
I can't even much count it
Silkk the Shocker, or should I say
The black Frank Nitty see,
Oz's to make g's
The mayor gave me and P keys to the city
Livin' an American dream
5 karats on my pinky ring
Ladies wanna make love to me
Niggaz wanna look at me all mean
But it's aaight cause you still wonder
I don't want your old lady
But she still flip me the number, I wish she'd flip me some money
See um, it's aight to have cash and thangs
Ghetto millionares to live fashion man
600 we gonna be smashin' man
But since I can't spend no bitches
So I need some cash and thangs

Fill the voice with no muffler, I's a bad motherfucker

Can't control my rhymes, because them bitches seep through 
My teeth, so cold I heats, rising like some yeast, bake some beats 
Meltin needers off of technique and that's just when I speak 
Seek and you should find that my mind is beyond 
and y'all niggas lines behind the times of my first lines 
Shit I'm in my prime, I want it with the mic or the nine 
For mine it protects crimes to the blind (he ain't lying) 
And I ain't dying line goes the paper the chase 
P done gave me the break for me to make some cake 
still dope I cook in sake, got pretty ass hoes to bake

Cause this business makin me a weed conniseur 
Meet the have-been, one of the last men on this note

A nigga to give more heart attacks than Fred Sanford had

September 2nd, get the fuckin world high 
bout my motherfuckin business, ha ha, 
Master P, Young Fiend and Mystikal 
Uungh!, bout it bout it",Here We Go [*]
Master P,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",If I Could Change [Street/Movie Version]

Thug nigga, no more tears, moma shared
No more pain in the muthaphukkin' new year

We scream, Makaveli to our enemies
You're like a ghost, to the niggas in the Eastcoast
Makaveli number one in every recordstore
You live life to the fullest, then you die
You taught niggas never run, just ride
Killaz, that's what you hanged with
Gangstaz, that's what you banged with
You felt dead around the corner, but you came out
Real niggas don't change, that's what's you'se about
You taught niggas to take pain, deal main
That's why Tupac, nigga scream your name
Tatooed up with t-shirt
When you die you say ashes and no dirt
See, you'se a legend in your own time
Ghetto means in every gangsta rhyme

Master P,"This is Master P 
I'm down here in South Park 
I just put a million dollar reward up 
For any information or anybody who know who killed Kenny 
Ya heard? 

[Chorus] 
(Kenny's dead) 
We got to ride tonight 
My little homey Kenny died tonight 
(that's what I said) 
Unh! 

Kenny strated messin' up  hangin' with the thugs 
Cutting class  in the fast section  see weed and drugs 
And I guess that's how it is, when the ghetto got you trapped 
But Kenny ain't scared, he seen his pops get his neck snapped 
People lie in they sheet, on South Park streets 
Where the hoes chill and everybody run from the police 
But what I liked about Kenny, he wasn't no crip or no blood 
And he mumbled when he talked, but he loved that bud 

[Chorus] 

A lot of hopeless nights chasin' nickels and dimes 
Kenny rode the other bus to school, but at night, he did crimes 
Two eleven, one eighty seven, it's like a hobby 
Kenny slowed his roll, he did three years for a robbery 
Some say Kenny was the poorest kid on the street 
But picture this, Kenny with about ten g's and a couple of keys 
Huh, servin' the dope fiends, standin' on the corner 
Moved and worked from New Orleans to Arizona 
But it was a trip, Kenny always wondered how he would die 
Would it be a car crash, a plane, a gun, or suicide 
He knew one day that the rats would come 
But he didn't know they was gonna scream ""'bout it 'bout it"" 
And hit him with a shotgun 
Unh! 

[Chorus] 

A lot of wasted deaths, a lot of senseless crime 
But everybody think about what you do out there, because uh 
Judgment day is for everybody 
Just remember that, uh, we can't take none of this wit' us 
And it's real out here on these streets 
I'd love to live like Kenny 
But just remember, Kenny wasn't nothin' but a cartoon 
Huh, died, he's dead, ain't no comin' back 
Ya heard me? 
Hombre, Master P, No Limit 
To the world, baby 
Don't get no realer than this",Kenny's Dead
Master P,"Hey dad I got in a fight with this white kid today at school
Son, didn't I tell you I don't want you fighting?
But he called me a nigger

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world 
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

Its a shame when you can't send your kids, to decent schools
We live in the world for the laws and no rules
Gang-bangers, crease sides, and chalk lines
Correctional facilities full of juveniles doin' petty crimes
In this ghetto, got me crazy
Sometimes I wish, mama wouldn'ta made me
But its a shame when you gotta raise a baby
And the color of my skin might taint me

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

And all the money can't change the color of your skin
Why so many blacks and Mexicans in the pen?
It is cause we VIOLENT?
But why Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and started smilin'?
So many people have dreams
But why society eliminated Martin Luther King?
And they tell us to be proud to be black
And at the same time Uncle John shoot us in the back
Independence, its a free country
No jobs, most blacks turn to street money
A bunch of ghetto full of drugs and alcohol
Where found history books about white laws
And Tommy Hilfiger discriminate
And sell us clothes
But we can't blame him cause
We don't support the black stores
And only God can judge or point the finger and what's
White or black and red and blue equals gang banging

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

(I'm just a black man
Trapped in this white world)
I'm colorblind, so Lord won't you feel my pain
(Hold on, hold on
Trapped in this white world)
I'm colorblind, so Lord won't you feel my pain

P pray for your little brother
Silkk, keep your head up

I'm tryin' but sometime I get fed up (Damn)
What about all of the people that died in the past?
Peers I can't get back with too many found guilty
And I know they didn't do it
But still they can't get back
I see the copper be tryin' to nail me
Police constantly trailin' me
Cause I'm young, rich, and black
I'm always under survelience
Dash me out the car
And wanna ask me who the car fuck
Thay allowed to carry guns
Can't never be convicted
Who that law fuck?
I'm guilty till proven innocent
Still we all equals, how do you figure?
Cop told me
""you weren't speeding but I'm gonna give you a ticket cause you a nigger""
I seen the hardest of my homies
Break down in tears
A white judge looked them in the eyes
And gave them 35 years
Now its a everyday struggle
I hustle just to live
To raise your kids
When they got them teachin' them
Their parents better than them
They got me thinkin'
The color of my skin
Is a sin
I'm a black man in a white man's world
Where its set up for me not to win
Lookit, ain't that about a bitch
They look at us like we ain't shit
But lookit, I ain't racist, but face it, it exists
I'm a black man (Ungh)
I'm just a black man trapped in this white world 
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

Check this out (check this out)
Underneath (underneath)
Ain't no black or white (there ain't no black or white)
We all equal (we all equal)
We all equal (we all equal)
We all (remember that)
Got the same opportunity
Whether we wanna be judges, doctors, or lawyers
Ain't a black or white thing
Pick the best man for the job
And there shouldn't be no hatin'
Where you live, if you can afford to buy a house
Should be able to live wherever you want
The same hospitality they give to athletes
And movie stars
Should give that same hospitality and companionship
To your neighbors
You heard me?
Y'all know it ain't a black and white thing with me
I just make music
For the reality
Only the real could feel this, huh
Only the real could feel this",Black and White

Da Last Don  
Charlie Hustle. 
Check it out. 

Let it be writ and said, done and published 
That on the sixth month of June 1998 
E-40 Fonzarellie A-K-A Charlie Hustleezy 
And my Third Ward weepilation 
From the No Limit Records Headquarters and congregation 
Plugged up and did a rumble together without no hesitation and erased 
Any Old School classic memories of Northern California 
Godzilla ballin' and Bay stranglin' and hustlin'
Morning, night, day in Norleans 
And dang near fallin' asleep on the freeway 
Bobbin and weavin' and ditchin' and dodgin' po-po, Penelope force 
Tryin' to convince em that me and the dope game wasn't gettin' along any how 
We had been went our separate ways 
Shit, we been had a divorce 
In and out of court, betta' yet 
Neva was married any how and engaged 
Pushed in the game at a young age, trapped in a ghetto cage 
Went from hardly any to, uh, plenty of cash 
To, uh, high speed chases to, uh, makin a dash 
Uh, excuse me sir can I have your autograph 
And, uh, when your new album droppin fool 
That other shit was cool 

[Chorus]
Get your money man, get your paper 
Get your paper man, get your money 
Get your fettie or your scratch, get your skrill 
Get your revvies man, get paid 
Get your mail man, get your marbles 
Get your marbles man, get your mail 
Get your grits, get your chettah, get your chips 
Get your snaps man, get paid 

Ugh! Ball wit da real, hang wit da Gs 
Started from Richmond, California to New Orleans 
Game won't change, these niggas can't fade me 
Mama still pray for baby 
Ghetto got me sick, dope fiends and crack heads 
Niggas on da front porch wit tech nines and lemon heads 
And all I want be is a soldier 
Cause I'm tired of runnin' from da rollas 
Jumped in da rap game and now dey can't hold us 
Ghetto millionaires and still blowin' doja 
Keep my composure when times hectic 
Now I own a house in California, Orlando, and Texas 
And still run wit the thug niggas 
And made tapes for bitches and drug dealas 
And push 600 wit a bulletproof 
The ghetto Bill Gates 
The only president wit a gold tooth 

[Chorus]

Uh, n-neva let your guards down 
Always play defense neva offense 
Cause suckas a try to make your kindness for weakness 
And damn sho try to shake your hand up unda falsified pretenses 
Sequence this
Paint a portrait of these next events 
See if you can predict what I was about to say 
Within the next couple of sentences 
Technically impossible 
To hard to call 
See right when he thought I was gone throw a slider 
I threw him a knuckle ball 
Back against the wall, knockin' niggas out (knockin' niggas out) 
Hemmed up in da corner nigga that's what I'm about 

Feel my pain, sometimes I feel trapped 
Nigga tired of hangin' in the ghetto takin' food stamps 
Cause this street life got me crazy 
But I hustle cause I gotta feed a baby 
And only God can take me 
And ain't no nigga in this hood gone play me 
So when I ball I'm a ball til I fizall 
And when I'm gone put my name on the wizall 

[Chorus]",Get Your Paper
Master P,"I was born... coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
When ya comin from the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I see you takin bills

I'm ready to ride, ready to roll
Ay check this mack I bet you're boyfriend aint knowin
That I'm steadily blowin your back out
Watch me track out on these niggas and bounce out on these hoes
Get at em like ""what's up trick"" you know how it goes
It's Friday night, the club is about to close
And I was lookin fabulous
So I,  got up to stretch 'bout to catch me one of these stragglers
True eastside dogs, and we barkin not simpin
Yo holmes 'bout that time to start this parking lot pimpin
I keep that thang, huh, posted in the same spot
Nothin but my khaki shorts, house shoes, boxers and my suede shine
I'm from the home of the riots
That's before the peace died but I'm still hollin out eastside

Uhh, what y'all busters gon do
When the pimps, bangers, and hustlers smash on you
It aint about who's sellin the most caine
Put us all together nigga see you run thangs
If you can't hang, stay the fuck out the kitchen
Bitch I'm ghetto fabbed out, so fuck politickin
Waitin for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin
All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got daytons, Goldie's got daytons

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin

Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin it up is livin life in the ghetto

I was born... coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
When ya comin from the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I see you takin bills",Ghetto Life

Chorus (2x): 
You just don't know what you do to me 
And I hope you know what you got 
Master P: 
I remember walking you from school and homies hate me 
But I ain't tripping cause I knew one day girl you'd be my lady 
Probably have my baby I know it sound crazy 
But thugs need love and if you real girl save me 
Your loyalty got me a sucker for love 
And when I went to jail you sent kisses and hugs 
And I could feel your lips through your letters 
You said you wait for me, 'cause you down for whatever 
Now I'm out girl and we balling 
Mansions, 600 Benzes, Lex Luther, trucks and Ferraries 
Rolex watches and bracelets 
Diamonds on your ears and fingers and taking trips to foreign places 
Now we be hooked like drugs 
But you been there from the beginning, that's why we call it ghetto 
love 
And I hope you know what you got 
You just don't know what you do to me 
And I hope you know what you got 
Mia X: 
My thug love got the weight of the world on his shoulders 
So every chance I get I try to grab him and hold him 
Boo you know I care, I'm gone be there through the toughest of times 
Trying not to ever stress ya take the pressure off ya mind 
You my kind of nigga ain't nobody else gone do 
I can't see being in love without you 
Beside me, inside me, nothing can divide you and me 
That's why them other broads know we gone be 
I ain't tripping, although your ass be slipping sometimes 
Running around and creeping but you know just where to find your true 
love 
Before the fame the big names and the money 
I was at the bus stop with you honey 
That's why you got me pushing phat ass rides 
With a swoll bank account living in a million dollar house, but don't

If you gotta go back to the projects I won't diss ya 
I'm coming right with ya cause I love you thug

This Ghetto Got me trapped (Ughhhh)

[Sons of Funk and Master P]
Lord won't you wash away my pain (this ghetto's got me trapped)
some say life is a crazy game (but I ain't ready yet)(2X)

[Master P]
found me on the street corner hangin' with the big niggas
playin' football in the ghetto we call it flea flicker
and ain't no rules 'cause niggas get shot 
and every fuckin' day niggas runnin' from the cops
nigga won't change mama 'til you bury me 
but make sure six TRU niggas carry me 
but if they miss know (nigga) you a goner 
'cause there ain't gone be no family members to mourn ya 
I wasted sperm for the ovaries drug dealin' to penetentaries (Ughhh)

Chorus(2X)

[Silkk the Shocker]

its a cold and cruel world sometimes it gets shady
I ain't been the same since my auntie gave birth to a crack baby
want to know why I'm rowdy I be clutchin' my glock 
'cause if I have P and see come over and tell mama young Silkk just got shot 
I couldn't even close my eyes and not feel the pain 
I could re-open my eyes and realize 
all the niggas that lost their lives in this game 
I lost a lot tryin' learn the facts of life fuck color nigga we all struggle
with this black or white to all my niggas in penetentaries 
I received ya'll letters 
and I swear to hang in there if things don't get better 
now picture this I got Auntie diein' of overdose uncle diein' of aids
realize that I got a little money but there's somethings money can't save
is there a heaven for gangstas is there a heaven period 
and based on the fact that things did wrong probably 'cause I hang with
too many killers and niggas diein' over wars shits hard where I'm from
that's why I spit it how I live it and I get it how it come 
on top of that I had a fucked up day 
to god look couldn't find the words to explain so I'll tell you
tonight when I pray feel my pain

[Master P] 

RIP homie  RIP 

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 

How do I say goodbye to what we had 

The good times that made us laugh outweighted the bad 

I thought we'd get to see forever 

But forever's gone away 

It's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

[Master P] 

y'all niggas smile for my ghetto heroes 

So many homies gone  trying to ball till they fall 

Now I'm left with nothing but old cards 

and a bunch of pictures on the wall 

RIP tatoos nigga, just to show you that we real 

But I still can't believe that your dead fool, and how you got killed 

And on your birthday me and my boys visit your grave 

And I remember when you first got high 

and the first time you got laid 

And I'm going through a thing, Kevin nigga, what should I do 

I never imagined living life without a nigga like you 

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 

Chorus 

Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

[Master P] 

We shed so many ghetto tears, see time is crazy 

And every sunday grandma go to church 

she said she gotta pray for her baby 

And ah, your little son, he look just like you 

And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through 

And ah me, see and Silk we got a little money but that don't mean shit 

Cause I burn all that shit up nigga, just to have you again 

And it's real out here, all you niggas that's goin through some pain 

Keep your head up, and this for everybody 

that lost a relative in the street game 

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 

Chorus 

[Silkk The Shocker] 

Now look, I couldn't imagine life without you 

I just sit here wonderin why 

But the law of life, and god placed us here 

and said everybody must die 

Ended hard trying to move on but still I try 

Even though we got money, judgement day 

just some things we can't buy 

Even though you gone, I never let you move on 

Cause every time i think about you 

I sit back and write your name in a song 

Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt 

It's kinda spooky when one day I see your face on a t-shirt 

I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better 

And why it take a death or a funeral to bring our family together 

Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father 

Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them 

You'll never know whether they'll be here tomorrow

Master P,"Chorus:Master P
Daddy wasn't home so mama raised me
I'ma thug but still mama bathed me (4X)

Verse 1:Master P
I live my life as a thug, roll wit' some killas
Slang crack to some dope fiends, ride wit' some drug dealers
Find me in 3rd ward pullin' all nightas
Keep a tech 9 cocked for any nigga that don't like me
Throw up your soldier rags if you rowdy
I represent a million muthafuckas that's 'bout it
Mama couldn't control my destiny as a street thug
Find me in the Range Rover buyin, sellin street drugs
Even though, this ghetto got me crazy
Everytime I go to jail mama get me out cause I'm her baby

CHORUS (2X)

Verse 2: Snoop Dogg
I'ma gangsta, located in the alleys and Cali
Shoot dice wit' killas and smoke wit' the dealers
You can't tell me shit 'bout these streets homey
I don' seen it and done it and lived the real from the phony
Out for this money, homies maintain they composure
Since kids on the streets sellin' dope by the police
Now I'ma a soldier muthafucka for the chips
When I dips the trips, GP straight for DP
But the scripts how mama raised me 
Pops wasn't home, left us all alone
Wasn't no thang, cause my mama had game
She showed me everythang except how to be a man
I understand, for all the streets and the jail time I caught
The pain I brought, that wasn't what you taught
It's probably pops fault how I ended up
Gangbangin', crack slangin', not given' a fuck
Two strikes in my life, a nigga fed up
Mama said don't let up, and baby boy keep your head up

CHORUS (2X)

Verse 3:Soulja Slim
Now picture me a ghetto child, runnin' wild
Maybe if you emphasize, niggas supposed to pick us
The world wouldn't be like it is now
I made moms proud, when you mention me she smile
If feels good buyin' moms a car and a house
And my pops been locked up for ten years
Life was a struggle moms shed so many tears
That's why baby ain't got nothin' that I love so much
The only one can hurt my feelings, when she fuss
Momma I love you cause you brought me hear
But niggas startin' to hate and it's gettin' dark in here
But I remember what you told me, and what ya' showed me
Take it slowly

CHORUS (4X)",Mama Raised Me

Could you do me that and I'll hit you back
Little nig just don't know where my thugs at

Got a lot of my thugs in the grave long gone
May they rest in peace

Oh, and hey and then when you dropping you might as well give me your bank

Fucked up
We wouldn't of had to resort to violence
But man the nigga was raised that way
And I'm gon stay that way even if I die today

Burnin' flesh
Have you ever smelled nigga?
Been tapped up, ready to die from mail niggas

Straight goin' to hell
But livin' the dirty, dirty
Havin' yah mama worry
That (?)

Tired of being blast at, but didn't cast that
I done asked for my life, and right there was laughed at
But when I backtracked, (?)
Blast back

But fact is you don't fuckin' choose yo' wars
Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns

Check my war wounds (uggggh)
My war wounds (ugggh)
Every soldier got a story to tell

My adversary's get popped
Got me runnin' from cops
The ghetto life be a dime
Got me carryin' two glocks

My enemies is bad
Chop limes of grass
Drive-bys and rags
And representin' red and blue flags

See I got fools from the ghetto
Like my cousin' Jimmy wear permanent metals
My evidence is satus with hoes
Bloody Polos

Pullin' in car do's
And cut up Jabos

I'm down the blast for my homies
And cash for my homies
Even if I'm old G I'll be down to ride and die
If the hood call me

That's why I be hustin' every day
Could you imagine me with no stash?
Like a bank with no cash
Tryin' drive a car with no gas

And fuck one day with no tag?
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
Or all you girls with no ass

See I'm a risky rider
Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans

See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo' shit
And the nigga the be the grave digga

See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live
See I been scared, popped at, and shot at

But I live an eye for eye
So the enemies I ain't forgot that

[Chorus: x2]

It's real, shit's real check my war wounds
This here real life, ain't no fuckin' cartoons
I'm the Saudi Arabian death killin' veteran on the tube
Either me or you right here

Come back and hang out in my room
I done shot my rifle, trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in ain't no turnin' back

Lay yo' ass over seas
Might as well handle your business
There's no overcome to this shit
Be on yo' Ps and Qs nigga

Don't cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga, that's a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga, that's a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why I'm gone

If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best
Middle finga pointin' sayin' fuck Iraq
If you don't believe me check my combat pack

[Chorus: x3]

I got a motherfuckin' story to tell
Nigga, nigga what?
A motherfuckin' story to tell (What?)
Fool, I got a muthafuckin' story the tell

And every nigga in the jail cell knows it well
I shank niggas, bank niggas
Do mo' for show
Seven cluckas, fake dough

Stayin' way cut throat
I hang out, slang out, at hotel rooms
Up all night gettin' in gun fights
I strike my head on the wall

Seven Eight ward
Eastside, rollin' dubs
Call me big Snoop Dogg
Follow me, and you'll see how Gs move

It's written on my face
I takes my war wounds
Been around drama since me and my mama
Use to listen to oldies

That's why I'm so old G
Look, when half of you niggas couldn't come outside
When y'all was learnin' how the sing

With niggas smelt like they richer hoes but they broke niggas 
And the bitches like the peapop (peapop)
And the niggas ride through the hood and like to slang rocks

And bitches want to make niggas into they baby daddy's
And niggas still ride old school Caddies 
And a bunch of block parties and borrowers on the corner
And niggas wish they could move to California

It never rain in the sun shine 'cause down here the murder rate's high
And bitches love to suck a line 
A lot of gold teeth and nicknames like Big Suo Big Baz Hot Boy and Big Man
And you might get a rep if you're a killer 

The city of the crawdads bad cops and drug dealers
And hoes love you if you're famous 
But niggas representin' wards in the projects is dangerous

Bruise it up 'cause he shoot it up everybody suited up screamin'
God Why he was a killer and that's how most killers die 
I used to tell him slow his roll back in '94 

He was a trippy dog runnin' from the po-po 
Robbin' niggas for their rangs and thangs 
He ran up on the wrong nigga re-arranged his brain
Now check it in my city ain't no Crips and Bloods but niggas yell 3rd ward

Come equipped with slugs and niggas soldier rags throwin' at those who bags
Kickin' up dust chasin' paper that say in god we trust
Now the five can't do nothin' for my light bill some motherfuckers
Might kill for the right skrill in the city we do busy and bust

Do a bid in a minute just to get some scrilla dawg
It's a cold game, I mean she used cold names
Like Nikki, Mimi, Shelly, you know her man

Be a Queen to the King I mean a right spouse
Project chick, but when you see her she be playa
Thuggin on da block but in bed she be nasty
I'm lovin that, I mean I'm huggin that
Put 10 karats on her finger other bitches muggin that
Rolls 600, tats on stomach
Ain't no stuntin, but love gettin money

Don't creep wit her, gotta sleep wit her
I mean I love her too much to draw the heat wit her

Yeah shorty, we could be like Bonnie & Clyde, ya heard
Go out there and get this paper
You wit it? (yeah I'm wit it)
Then let's ride then (alright)

[Chorus: Master P (Souya)]
If them people find that steal (I'll take a case for you)
If I go to jail (I'm a wait for you)
If they question you (I ain't gonna say nothin')
If I need bail (I'm a bring the money)

[Master P]
I ain't checkin' you shorty
But it's somethin' I need to know
How serious this relationship is
And how far can it go

See, love and respect is somethin' you gotta earn
And if we don't keep up with each other, then somebody else get a turn
Would you ask me why if I told you to carry a gun
And do you know how to spur me if I just wanted to have some fun

Can a thug get a massage if I needed your hands
And would you jump in the ride if I told you to bring me them thangs
If a nigga tried to get at me would you ride for me
And if you couldn't swim would you take a dive for me

I know you like gifts, so I could buy you things
Like Benzs, Jaguars, ?? bubble-eyed Range
No obligation, I'm just tryin' to keep it real
Would you argue, fuss and fight when I need you to chill

Can you be cute and still be freakin'
When I leave out the door you ain't gonna try to be sneakin'
If I go to jail you can ?? my people
I need you Lord till I come home and be the sequel

[Chorus]

[Curren$y]
I been through a lot of girls in my life
But never found one who down to ride like you ride
If it's a problem then you gon' be right by my side
Even if I got a couple keys I need you to hide

'Cause you a real chick
One that I can chill with and bill with
Help me get my hustle on, climb up on the mill with
Even through the trouble you don't want a nigga still with

When it's said and done gon' be the one I have my kids with
Yeah you my baby girl, livin' in this crazy world
Wanted you a burner so I bought you a 380 girl
You understand my life and know that it's hard for me

And you the kind of girl I know my mama would want for me
And if the coppers stop us I know you'll take the charge for me
Makin' sure, stack some bricks in the trunk of your car for me
We live the lifestyle of ballers and stars and shit
And I'm out here grindin' to make sure we can afford the shit

Ferrari, 360 is so clean.....
Ashanti rims, that really bing bing
And girls trip when they get in the ride
I got see-L 5, steering wheel on the other
side,
And I'm gangsta man, whatcha thinkin man?....
Shawty want to roll cause I'm on them Twinkies man

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3: LiL Romeo]
Now I'm know I'm kinda young but I keep my dubs clean...
Nick name my rims deime (d-e-i-m-e) cause they older then me
At the age of 15 man, doin big thinkgs man,
Don't hate dog! (why) cause you ain't me man
Some say I'm ballin cause my crome stay crawlin
Took the phantom for a ride, now they stay I'm night crawlin
Never get hungry cause I keep them deep dish'es
The people you saw, then they take pictures
My hummer sit clean on the shaq's minus 8
White, gold and purple, just like them old days (man...)
Now its kinda crazy cause Mercedes getting jeolous (what?)
Range won't asanti's but they can't have it
All for less its my baby, my boo, if I ever need help!
I just scream whoodi whoo!,
P miller speakers match my p.miller sneakers
The ones on my feet and the ones on my beamer!

[Chorus 2x]",I Need Dubs
Master P,"[Intro]
I'm too strong to lose, I mean
My hustlin skills keep me in the game
I've got too much paper to fall off
Man you can take all kind of shots at me I'll bounce back

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You only get one life my nigga
And they steady throwin stones but I'm alright my nigga
The same way they did Christ my nigga
But I ain't mad at 'em, they hurtin and I'm alright my nigga

[Master P]
See ""I'm a Hustla"" homey and you a customer homey
I ain't Cassidy or Jigga but you can't touch me homey
I get my money from the block nigga the Ghetto Bill Gates
I got niggaz on my team from the South to the Bay
I didn't change when I made it I kept stackin my bacon
I'm on the block hustlin hard like I'm black and Jamaican
First they love you then hate you, man these bitches'll break you
From the streets to the pen, man these niggaz'll fade you
Man yo' mother could take you, man yo' brother could hate you
I got cousins tryin to kill each other, catchin the vapors
Disown ya mayne, run up on ya mayne
Pops said what don't kill you make you stronger mayne

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Niggaz rattin for cream, rappers switchin up teams
I'm like Michael Jordan nigga I'm tryin to follow my dream
Real niggaz gon' feel me, see these streets'll kill me
But I'm out here thuggin tryin to feed these children
Turn my family against me, man these cops'll flip me
Play my records if I die, like radio miss me
Ghetto niggaz made history, then the media hit me
I guess I ain't controversy enough like Game and 50
I'm from the streets my nigga, pack that heat my nigga
I'm a boss but suit and ties that ain't me my nigga
I'm from the hood my nigga, what's good my nigga
Uptown, Callope, I'm a bull my nigga
I'm on the block gettin paper nigga you can't hate me nigga
My son worth seven figures you can't break me nigga
I'm on the grind gettin cheddar and cheese
And I started in the ghetto back in New Orleans
I'm a hustler homey

[Chorus]

",I'm Alright
Master P,"I've been tryin to call you baby, where you at?
I'm out here on the block thuggin
After this, you ain't gon' have to want for nuttin, ya heard?

I've been waitin' on you, for all night long
Thinkin' 'bout what I'll do when you get home
Boy I'll cook for you, massage you too
And give you that freaky good lovin' if you want me to

[Chorus:Repeat x4]
It's all good shorty, this be the hood shorty
Paradise straight up the road through the wood shorty

Wanna take you to, paradise cause the hood is hot
We done seen so many people in the hood get shot
And I, don't wanna see my baby cry
Anything happen to you I'm down to ride or die
And, I know the kids come first
But I love puttin' money in your Louis Vuitton purse, can you feel me?
Girl you lookin' beautiful
Let's get your nails done, on a plane or a boat
You deserve the finer thangs
Like Jaguars, minks, and diamond rangs
A mansion with a big piano
We can live like the Black Sopranos
They say all good girls love thug niggaz
I guess that's why I'm so in love wit'cha
Let's ride, let's ride
Me and you we can thug to the other side

[Chorus]

I want it, I want it
I really really want it
I'm gonna, put it on ya
So tell me that you want it
I need it, I need it
I really really need it
I'm gonna, put it on ya
So tell me that you want it

Put you in a bubble I Bentley with the matchin' top
Hit the mall shawty, you can shop 'til you drop
I told you I'ma change your world
Designer names, you that kind of girl
Diamond rangs with the Rolex
You need a dress, Liz Claiborne can drop into the pro-jects
You put my name on your body and I'm feelin' that
You told me never let the hood hold you back
You was there when I needed ya
Now, I don't mind {?} pleasin' ya
Girl we used to thug together
On the block, even hit the club together
Wakin' up to cool-Aid and Crist'
Now you got the ice the size of Hershey's Kiss
I went to jail, youse the first to come visit
Now I'm home, anythang you want, girl go get it

[Chorus]

I want it, I want it
I really really want it
I'm gonna, put it on ya
So tell me that you want it

Butt naked buttocks make niggas act unorthodox

In one week got more strokes on your ass than cash them players be making

And have your crew running in 4 different directions
At 90 degrees angles that connect at no point
Til the missino is completed every sipher I anoint
With my whip appeal as I whoop your crew single handed
living proof that the universe expanded when I landed
On every continent island and water body existing
On any planet in any galaxy I enlist in
When I decide too be born into a form that is tangible
Only because I made it firm enough to handle you
Other than you be looking up in the sky waiting for mysteries
While I'm steady creating history
Picture me rolling like ome of these cats I'm aware of

To back a nigga like me one of the livest Mc's
Out of the NY, capital K see when I
Drop the semi-automatical, lyrically dramatical
Grammatically written to leave a niggas head splittin
Splittin rhymes to slice minds like enzymes in centrifuges
Busting mines then lay back like the luge
We upped the ante, bounced from the penthouse to shanty's
And now second coming got believers quickly running for the
Wax racks to pack stacks of black facts on fat tracks
On black wax in knapsacks
In back Ac's dipping with the volumen on 10
Down the Ave with my joint on your blend
See ya'll need to comprehend every time this brother pick up his pen
And thought you emerge many niggas get served now that's word

Ey Yo I'm slippin down a dark hole touchin my soul
Think I'm rushin to the stars flash forward to zones
Can't move a single bone so I let out a moan
Would burn every single poem I wrote just to reach home
Feel a rope around my neck tight wrip grip no slack
then I hear a whipe make a loud crack
Then feel the flesh on my back split allowing blood to drip to the floor
Then I hear a whole crowd roar
With my last bit of strength open my eyes
To see a pack  of rednecks straight from 1905
Could tell by the clothes thery wore and their broken grammar
That I was the main event of a lynching in Alabama
My body started shaking stamina breaking down
I screamed take me down they started laughing like clowns
I wish I had a 4 pound or any automatic gun
Just to see them crackers run like Satan had come
Then I heard the sheriff say  ""Hey, bring me his son.""
Now picture that want my little boy to see his Daddy get hung
Then the sheriff turned to me and said ""Ain't this fun?
Well this is what you get for florting with a white woman""

[Chorus] 2x
Ey yo from day one you see they try to take us under
Police with guns, and clans hanging us from lumber
the shit don't change no matter the time no matter the place
it all stays the same

1963 and now I'm trapped in a Birmingham jail
Next door to King sitting hand cuffed to the rail
I sailed through 3 generations of time but same predicament
Cause now I'm deep in the thick of it, sick of
I started downtown shopping at Montgomery Wards
Where my mom sent me to buy a new ironing board
>From down on Main Street, trooping through the summertime heat
Sweating bullets, came to the colored door and I pull it
Seen this white girl in late teens, blond hair and tight jeans
Shorts who stopped to ask me  if I like to play sports
I replied yes, told her basketball was my best
but all these lip reading white folks got confused with ""nice breast""
Now it's one mess after another,
get booted from out the store, still no ironingboard to give my mother
Hovered outside on the grass where it seems that news travels fast
Everyone that past said ""that's your ass!""
So I run home to tell mom, to just chill and stay calm
But two hours later they burned a croos on the lawn
Until dawn we stayed frightened my first instinct was fighting
But 10 hooded crackers against one, and I'm done
So I run to keep my family from any more calamity
Right before the riverbank is where I got janked
About to get hanged when the sheriff made his interjection
And now I'm sitting in jail for my protection

What's our frame of mind?
Master of mainstream disaster
And now that you know, no doubt you've been captured
Caught buy pay attention and we'll let your thougts roam free
The underground liberty

[Oracle]
A high chance you'll get damaged in this life challenge
Though it's hard to manage like scales that are off balance
Ay yo niggas are nuts riding my phallus
They're trying to compare my rap ballads
While they're spittin' hot shit 'cause they toss salad
My people travel upstream like salmon
Got water flows powerful like a firehose
Connect it to your stereo and feel the Water World hysteria take you over
Don't matter if you're drunk or sober
Got you entranced like Indian dancing cobra's
Our melodies are solar so you can see the light
Our only claim is we're the brightest
Don't want to be the nicest lyricist
'Cause thruthfully words are primitive
You get amped when we jump start your party and make you chant
I'll enhance your motion with electric shocks ferocious
It's trance music hypnosis
We're moving crows like water in front of Moses
You're wet before you notice
This workout like Tae-Bo aerobics
With punch lines and drum kicks and all sets get flipped
High and low decibels hit and whole crews get split in half
And no doubht you know the math

[Chorus] (2x)

[Kimani]
You know the way the shit goes money for nothing and the chicks for free
But I swear sometimes when I be watching MTV
I'm catching visions of violence, sit in silence
For 120 minutes before I raised the black flag like Henry Rollins
Calling up to loveline ""hello? Wel..""
I got a story to tell to do with they ky-gel
I speared Brittany in the back of a Caddy with 9 inches of meat
Talking on my cell phone to Puff Daddy at the Grammy's
Told him ""Put me on the guestlist!""
Got backstage and hung Brandy with a rusty ass necklace
They went back for the street boys, I gut off the street noise
By breaking their necks on the floor like a be	-boy
Then destroyed the whole program
Had a vision where the wizard was N'sync and I was Conan
I sliced 5 necks at the stem
Laced the mic with see-4 set to blow when Usher Raymond begin
Then stuck my Tim's in the white flabby ass of Marilyn Manson
Gave him a gat and had him bucking at Hanson
Now I'm phantom like the menace, whole crews get diminished
When I'm screaming out loud like No Limit
Present the best rap performance to me, R&B vocal
Hard rock, classical, and country
They're all mine, I'm sort of like the greatest all time
You're sweating me more then Jennifer Lo's behind
While I'm here player hating on most
Grandiose MC's I be turning your bread to burnt toast
With John Blaze shit the type to amze with
I rap tight like Africans packed up in a slave ship

They hide the cost!

To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, can't forget her
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.

You know I'm legend though you clown man stiff and blow
I got the big stage, no props for yo' small show
I light your anus up, pee upon your whole spectrum
Then damage all butt with missiles to your girl's rectum
No matter how where, with activator on your hair
You could be weaved up, toes to your sleeve up
A-D-A-T's work you got static, turn your Nieve up
You on four-track, tic-tac, I still wipe butt crack
Battle me now your cornflake style, chocolate cow
You no test catnip slop runnin' down your vest
Master of what, your kitty styles fall butt
Incest, you settle for less
Yo lick my wee-wee, your sister tried to watch me pee-pee

You get asked up, records get faxed up
Your booty get torn your heiny's all waxed up

I see emcees waste time and vinyl, your point is final
You trapped in the cage and now pregnant by a green rhino

Like Ted Bundy and Kemper, I burn your wig this winter
No matter how hard you are, I still paint that back
Then draw some pictures of Space Ghost on yo' ass crack
With Scooby Doo, Fred and Wilma watchin' Dino doo-doo
Your style is no flake, them beige boots are kinda weak
You suck nuts and lick my balls every time I speak
You at the Apollo, you whack easy act to follow
You get no props, for skirts suckin' Charms pops
You on my penis, still wearin' shell-toe Adidas
I'm in your building, like paint chips off your ceiling
Fake face, yo pack up, start watchin' Scarface
I strike your tour bus, catch you naked smokin' dust
Rip your papers at halftime, your rented rhymes are rust
You got no wins, for crabs in your used Benz
Extra mic stands for Taco Bell burns yo' friends

You know how it is, I hear a noise and take my shit straight to the shop
Nigga FIX MY SHIT and run it by eight o'clock
Who she roll with, Clyde that down South Southern-ass drawer nigga
Yo tell him you with Clifton, and Lady Jones clockin these figures
You see we all connected
My leopard spot drawers got infected

Niggaz sweatin in a drop-top Vette, but it ain't mine

44 mag glove compartment and the plastic bag
I come real with shit, Bobby who you fuckin with?
You down South with the Klabman, close your fuckin mouth
I'm Lenny Jones, chewin steaks, y'all eatin chicken bones
4th of July them city boys come and start trouble
Uncle Harold lightin ass with the double barrels
Winchester sawed-off, blast a motherfucker's neck off
We blow yo' leg off, the shirts and yo' whole head off
We called the ambulance, paramedics in yo' progress
My cousin Ricky, with jheri curls through yo' vest
Double ocks catch crews out there in many spots
Big boy Uncle Pete, down South hustler
Go help Aunt Reese, you motherfuckers bring the mustard
Chicken salad, don't fuck with grandma layin on the palette
y'all take aim and rest, with liquor on yo' fuckin breath

Libra
My name is Keith
We got some nice things for the ladies
Go get the ladies some flowers and stuff
Other people don't love them like we do

I never hurt you talk to you decent at night
And in the daytime I watch you while you sunbathe
And if it rains I bring you straight abouve the water girl
Let me bring you in the house and make some cope of your back
I am stupisfied you know I got my way up
I push you over a 300 just to keep me in the dirt
I love it when we hit the city you got the fireplace
I bring you fire in the a place
Why can't it be me and you
I see your chocolate brown skin
I see your peanut-butter skin breast make me feel like a child go feed me
I bite your rigth cheak and leave a monkey bite
Why can't we be one 'til we die
And if we die why can't we multiply
And if we cry I make sure that a wild kid like me takes care of home while
we two are take

(7x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

I'm not Babyface Jimmy Jam of the Lewis
When I look at you the sex male want to do this
Taste you up and down
Bite the honey brown
Takes you hand up so we can go and have fun
Pope the grill out and everybody chill out
Got to play the little prince
Marvin Grey, sexual healing
You on the blanket I'm ready for fingering
Holding you in the grass whith your so bra jingelling
I got a fruit cocktail for your stomach
Some jellies and juicy fruits from Bellies when I rob it
I lick you there where he won't we lick you there where he don't
Bringing extra underwear to the picknic
Amen to excesy we can get love sick
so quick mick and hunble my ohhhhhh

(7x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

In the bathter looking for your bubble bath
With a condom you bout to make me wonder
Woman I drink your bath water like a beaver art
And pop the bubbles of your bath with my indexfinger
Drinking cups and teas in the fireplace
My hand is slight, touching on the right place
The G-spot I know you got a lot of loving hugging
Your juice is ooze how can I loose
When a woman loves a man
she'll bring her best friend with laundry over to your house
When a woman loves a man, she'll clean the grind off your feet

(4x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

Yeah baby you know I respect you for
Brought me to Burger King
Ride with me in my litty lorry you know sticking bombs sticking them
Yeah you know light castles be emotional
65 Shebbies can't afford the Benzes we can only fantasize
So you won't need them...",Let Me Talk to You

Rappers are weak, most of them belong to Romper Room
They talkin bla bla, baby stuff a lot of rah rah
I close my ears out, windows down, I don't hear 'em
Commercial raps turn pop, two years they get dropped
Stop makin facts, factories stop they vinyl wax
That's on the pressin plant, break 'em down, to a compound
Most of these acts get tough while labels hate they buttcrack
Rip out your rectum, your spinal cord, I dissect 'em
Stop your limit, your style old like Dodge Plymouth
Chevrolet, Cabrolet, your mic sounds in the hallway
Groovin you looped it, you start to write, you sound stupid
Your engineerin level, bass and kicks sound like treble
Mix on your Tascam boards, yo Keith extension cord
You're no comp for me, your corny style smell like pee pee
I ride the see-see, while girls on the train beep me
Pump up my pager, models move, style major
Workin that stage back and forth like we Chuck and Flavor
Rapamatic automatic, erratic fanatic
Fantastic measure, for your rappin pleasure (oh yeah)

[Chorus] - 1.5X

[Motion Man]
I'm kind of like a {?} in the field
Niggaz gotta jump or move, or shake around
Either way they got to yield
How you gonna rap and sport a 'Ville
You walkin in the middle of a store
I cock back smack the backside of your mug
Attack and leave your ass deformed
R. Kelly believe when I perform
I'm givin you what you need to field
That funk that comes around the backside of your head
Now orbitin for real
I'm off that bomb from East bay
That smoke that'll {?} five
But I take twenty sacks straight to the head, so here's my 45
y'all know that Motion Man is live, and I'm about to make a switch
On it like a Satchel Paige pitch
My amazement will amaze them and truly daze them
Drug 'em like a fix, or maybe I'll drag 'em like a race
I don't talk behind their back
Attack 'em on the back and bring it to their face
I'm down to make {?} in the race, MC's pull up limpin
So far, no rap star, will match my lyric bazaar
I'm so crazy conceited, rhymin 12 years with no money
Yo kid check it I'm heated, all y'all niggaz blades of grass
While I'm Lawnmower Man, crankin up with a full tank of gas
Pbbbbt, clearin the field

Up at the mall wearin' the gold chains, one of the guys from BET

He turned his back to me 
Because I am so cool!

I waste no time tellin' you in front of your ugly girlfriend you can't rhyme
Smack your engineer with a tall can of Olde English beer
Urinate on your S-S-L board and your lyrics sheet
Defecate in the hood at your store for leavin' your fans
Butt-naked with a box of Pampers in the middle of the street
Blow your socks off, send the girls you take to exquisite restaurants
To Pink Hot Dog, exclusive company just miss the masses
Talk to white girls with flat stomachs, no stretch marks, with black girl asses
Upscale extravagant, no autographs
Tell the Backstreet Boys I'm arrogant
Lady singers and rappers, I'm Keith Livingston your lawyer, I'm gonna work you
My job is to give you a Benz, close your publishing deal while I jerk you
The contract's ready, you already signed the first two
Your butt crack is I'ma put you on Rap City with Tigger and hurt you
Nothin' to reimburse you, my voodoo curse you
Anything that come out I will alert you
Turn your ass around like a marble head baby and burp you
Smack you, beat you with a telephone cord, I can reach you

Impact a vengeance, female rappers with extensions
Sewin' they wig skullcaps, tryin' to cover naps
P's in the back of they beanie, a rented Lamborghini
You frontin' hard on BET, tryin' to eat linguini
You ain't Italian, with six carat your fake medallions
Frontin' ass homo, rap style can't flow slow
Money for stickers, burn the kids who drew your first logo
Be duckin' royalties, sabotage, whack emcees
Your facilities, on 4 track, when you record
You never walk away with tights and a rap reward
No matter how complex, you try to make the equation
I light a match and throw it at you at a gas station
Open yo' can up, and bake yo' left mic hand up
You want to stand up, you married boy, bring your man up
You got the wedgie, your thong showin', lookin' edgy

So I hid behind a tombstone fascinated by the sight
The I heard her call my name, 'J.B.' she called again
Come join the witches dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the silver glow, you see the wind begin to blow
Young angels knelt before me in the moonlight
The hands that beckoned me drew me in to see
I was dancing with the witches in the moonlight

When I was young I didn't know
The summer days seemed 25 years long Now I ain't no wiser but I know
That it's a drag to be alone

So the moon took control of my eyes and my soul
Now I'm smiling cause I know for me
No bell can ever toll
I'm dancing with the witches in the moonlight
Watch me dancing with the witches in the moonlight

Is the inability of yanks to make a good cup of tea

How simple and clear can the instructions be?

And a pot of water and it may be hot

Get our tea
We need tea

Doesn't matter if we're all alone
It doesn't matter at all x2

'Cause I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would cross any line, I'd swim across the sea

To show you it's for real",Bullet
Mat Kearney,"Call me anything but lonely
Through a stone disown me
Let 'em know I'll never, ever be the same

'Cause they all head on home in the morning
Get on gone when it's storming
Let 'em know I'll never kiss it all away

When the morning sun comes
You'll know I didn't run

It still never changed

Mat Kearney,"My girl America is just a youth in this world
Her smile is more precious than the sparkle of pearls
And though her age reads she's just a young girl
Age behind her eyes show the pain that she's swirled
Through the hand that's been dealt though it's quiet as kept
The weight was all felt last night when she slept
And as she crept into the dreams of the things of her past
Seems to have grown so fast, way beyond her own class
Though they're right there with her, hers brothers and her sisters
A natural born leader even when her peers diss her
My girl, she's at a crossroads, people praying for her
Some are preying on her magazine ads, sex, drama, smoking marijuana
Longing for a father to call her 'daughter'
She's part of a generation longing for reconciliation
And this future that they're facing and this poison that they're tasting
My girl, I know this love that you're chasing

My girl America's crying when she's lying on her bed at night
I can see that she's screaming when she's dreaming for her freedom
My girl America's dying while she's trying just to stop this fight
Don't stop believing, my girl America

Boys with hungry eyes have been beating her door
Telling her that's what's she's for, trying to rob her at her core
Then leave calling her a whore, but still she knows there's more
I know she knows there's more because there's a voice she can't ignore
Cause it was founded in the foundations, from the day of her creation
In God we trust engraved in the treasures of her nation
And the void the boys can't fill
With the tippin' of the bottle or the poppin' of the pill
But still most of her friends don't care as they glare
Ready to drown the funnel as they frown down the tunnel
They stumble and they tumble, breaking down into rubble
My girl America, stop, can't you see
It's not the circumstances that determine who you're gonna be
But how you deal with these problems and pains that come your way
It's for you that I pray with hope for a brighter day
So I say, your deliverance is comin'

My girl America's crying when she's lying on her bed at night
I can see that she's screaming when she's dreaming for her freedom
My girl America's dying while she's trying just to stop this fight
Don't stop believing, my girl America

Faith like a child from your first birth
You left it in the dirt on your worst hurt
And I see each tear and every scar
The hands that have held you where you are
And I can see we've strayed so far
A king born under that morning star
As a crown of thorns was placed to erase
Each tear that's touched your face
His palms and sides were pierced with spears
He hung in love just to draw you near
My girl, out of this whole world
Can't you see this is where we started

My girl America's crying when she's lying on her bed at night
I can see that she's screaming when she's dreaming for her freedom
My girl America's dying while she's trying just to stop this fight
Don't stop believing, my girl America

My girl America's crying when she's lying on her bed at night
I can see that she's screaming when she's dreaming for her freedom
My girl America's dying while she's trying just to stop this fight
Don't stop believing, my girl America

His palms and sides were pierced with spears
He hung in love just to draw you near
My girl, out of this whole world
Can't you see this is where we started
Where we started, where we started, my girl America",Girl America
Mat Kearney,"I meant it all and every part 
And every word right from the start 
I'll never let this love fall in the middle 

Cause you know you broke the hardest part 
You know you broke the hardest heart 
I'll never let this love fall in the middle 
Through it all 

Fifteen years old in a sea of blank faces 
Swimming bold against a stream that's mocking as it races 
In these halls, mountain high under a tangerine sky 
Crack a smile just to hide the race that's inside 
Eighteen years old bags packed and a pass for the rail 
One last look at the past as it drowns in the hail 
One in a million, still I keep feeling you keep me from a fall 
A world to lose coming back with you tall 
Through it all 

[Chorus]
No parachutes no safety nets here 
One foot on the water to face these fears 
I'm coming out strong like I can't be wrong 
I said ""hey, I won't fall in the middle"" 

Twenty five here I am with freshman lp's 
One life to write one, two years to repeat 
Behind a curtain, uncertain if an encore's in store 
Tuck my shoulder like a soldier to knock down the door 
Thirty something here I'm running with kisses for one girl 
These scars upon my sleeve still casting out my pearls 
Throw each stone microphone like it's my last turn 
With a kiss to the abyss and watch the ripples return 
Through it all 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

And I'm gonna be alright, I'm gonna be alright 
With you by my side 
And I said I'm gonna be alright, I'm gonna be alright 
With you through this fight 
Through it all 

I meant it all and every part 
And every word right from the start 
I'll never let this love fall in the middle 
Through it all 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I meant it all and every part 
And every word right from the start 
I'll never let this love fall in the middle 
Through it all",In the Middle
Mat Kearney,"Like a breath of fresh air and the wind at my back
Toe to heel with strong strides taking miles off the map
In this journey called life where I've walked so far
Under the heat of your sun and the shine of your stars
Step by step I've crept, I've crawled, and I've run
Felt the palm of your hand and the barrel of death's gun
I ran for my life stood strong through strife
From a miscarried life to waiting for my wife like
I heard it sung a thousand strong all night long
Heard heaven's bell going something long, it's like
I've been there in total despair
Now I've tasted and I've touched
A breath of fresh air

'Cause I do live and I hope and pray
For something better and brighter today
For something there for something there

'Cause I was just a poor boy living in a poor world
But you gave me more love that set me free
'Cause I was just a poor boy living in a poor world
But you have gave me more love that set me free

Like road trips on open roads
Windows down sun setting and fresh new clothes
Shoes off so you can stop reflect on all these paths unfolding
With these staffs that are pulling in this world so controlling
It's not always best to take the interstate
Sometimes the most is on the windy coast way
'Cause wide is the path pulling astray
Narrow is the truth in these days
But all the while I hear a still small voice say
You climbed the cliffs rocked the desert on your very own
Swam the seas, sang the songs with the sweetest tones
The beaches you've combed, moons you've roamed the love you've shown
But all the while a voice calls you home

'Cause I do live and I hope and pray
For something better and brighter today
For something there for something there

'Cause I was just a poor boy living in a poor world
But you gave me more love that set me free
'Cause I was just a poor boy living in a poor world
But you have gave me more love that set me free",Poor Boy
Mat Kearney,"This is my renaissance
This is my one response
This is the way I say I love you

This is my second chance
This is my one romance
This is the cutting line
On which I stand to show you

It happened fast in a flash, just this evening
As I hit the gas, horn blast, brakes were screaming
As the car crashed, broken glass, broke my dreaming
I hit the dash, so fast my ears are ringing
My sister's on the right side just slightly leaning
I grabbed her hand hard until she started breathing
My brother's in the back, jaw cracked from the beating
The breath in my chest has slipped and I'm sinking
Blinking through diamond spider webs of cracked glass
I'm trying to remember all the words you said in the past
Through the ash, siren screams and red beams
I hear you sing softly to me

I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change
I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change

This is my broken heart
This is my bleeding start
This is the way I've come to know you

This is my winding road
This is my way back home
This is the narrow door you know that I will walk through

I got a letter today of why she went away
She said, â??It's better this way, you knew I never could stay.â??
Half empty closets and frames, all that's left to my name
As she left in the rain and left my heart on a chain
Three years I've built this two-face tower for hours on a lease
You gave me one yellow flower that said rest in peace
In pieces I've broken open to think too much or just enough
Alone to trust midst the rubble and the dust
Humbled, it took this much to break down and understand
Spent my life this far on castles made of sand
Tossed in the breakers in the palm of your hand
Now I can finally stand

I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change
I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change
I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change
I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change

I can be the one
I heard it in the song
And I can be the one
I heard it in the song

This is my renaissance
This is my one response
This is the way I say I love you",Renaissance
Mat Kearney,"I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow

I hear a cry going out in the middle of the night
Under the scatter of the stars from a voice cracked with fright
And as the tears stripe cheeks from pain running south
The taste of salt hits the corner of her mouth
Resting on tied tongues with no breath left to speak
Sick of throwing up with no bread left to eat
Tired and confused from disillusionment
Sunny days turn to grey and away he went
Ripping the hooks out your heart from the promises at dark
The words found their mark as the sheets came apart

Every spoken word broken
As he flipped you a token
Kiss on the cheek as his feet found the open door
What's in store for you he didn't question
Shook his burden to the floor to leave you guessing
About the future and what it will unfold
But you're still standing there rockin' it so bold like

I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow

I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow

Holding on these songs of hope 
I cannot sing them without you
Holding on, holding on

You can't just point a finger and say it's alright
Make a trip downtown and put it out of sight
Because two came together so strong one night
And two wrongs don't make one right
Giving a voice to the voiceless saying it's choice less
'Cause they're priceless my princess

I feel the kicks and the churns give me a turn
And a shot at this world to fight the fight
To beat my plight and let my light shine
In this dark time with all its ways of wearing crime
And let this world drown in these ultrasounds
Hearing this heart beats speak sweet so profound
From beat down to higher ground
Where hope abounds with love that astounds
Les Miserables this ain't no miserable daughter
Calling you Cossette 'cause God will be your father 

I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow
I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow

I cannot sing them without you

Mat Kearney,"I'm past the point of returning
For you I'm ruined and broken
There is no way of me turning
You've got my heart in the open

I see it shrink in the distance
In the glow of your glory
And I never will miss this
Bottom line of the story

I see the ocean come crashing
Under lavender skies
I see clouds come flashing
Now tell me, who am I?

You're the air that I'm breathing
While I'm lying there sleeping
You're the cool of the evening
Now you got me believing,

Trainwreck, I'm a trainwreck
Trainwreck. I'm a trainwreck for
You (Oh lord. yes I am) 

I'll kiss it all with a farewell
Goodbye, how you doing
And let it echo in stairwells
All these songs of my ruin

Now watch me climb my own cross
Without a loss for these words
As I motion a moment's silence
Let it fly with the birds

All else I got without you
Is mucha ado about nothing
I'd rather stand by you gone
Than on the throne of another

You had me all from the start
I count it lost every part
I'll sing it out in the dark
You've got a grip on my heart

You (Oh lord. yes I am) 

Where could I turn from you
The darkest nights, you know you'd find a way
What else have I to do
What words are there left to say
You are the air that I breathe in
Here is my heart I give
You are all of my reason
You are my reason to live

Mat Kearney,"It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable

February fifth, Friday morning, purple dawn
Broke a yawn as a I stepped through the fog, like I stepped to a song
A moment like a poem; you wish you could hold it
I shut my eyes like it's frozen; it's gone when I open

It slipped passed the clouds right there where it lingered
Like your band and a girl could slip through your fingers
My feet hit the ground like a beat for the lonely
On a path beaten down by the crowds in the morning

If only I could touch past the phony
If only they were there now to hold me
As the questions keep droning

You're the only one who stuck it out last night
The only other one who caught the other line
You're the only one when this world collides
The one that I can't deny

It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable

It's my last year here
My first class moved to portable 'A'
Under construction since summer
And it's cold today

I can see my breath and what's left of the west parking lot
And all the spaces that we fought
And it all seems forgotten, left in the bottom
In past piles of rubble in puddles of rain water

That hurt last night when I left like that
When I won't come back
Speaking my peace to the past
I can't help but wonder who is this wind at my back
A whisper to walk on come on from all that

It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable

How am I gonna take it away in this winter wind?
You found me on a summer breeze
How am I gonna run away when the autumn breaks
Now that you found me in the spring
Come on and sing it out",Undeniable

Mat Kearney,"You woke the morning up
Running off the darkest night
The longest fight I've seen
Here goes a chance I know
Cashing in on all my chips
Let all my ships come fly

These days, a little bit longer than the last
And all of your ways, a little bit stronger than the past
And your light, found my bottle in the night
Gave me second life, kept me in this fight

And I won't back down
I won't turn around and around
And I won't back down
Doesn't matter what comes crashing down
I'm still gonna stand on solid ground

You found me once and for all
I laid it down in the sinking ground
The hopeless undertow
Singing out the gentle sound
Rattling through my smoking screens
My broken dreams last night

These days, a little bit longer than the last
And all of your ways, a little bit stronger than the past
And your light, found my bottle in the night
Kept me in this fight and gave me second life

And I won't back down
I won't turn around and around
And I won't back down
Doesn't matter what comes crashing down
I'm still gonna stand on solid ground

Hallelujah ripped through my veins
I heard the hammer drop
My blood in the rain

Hallelujah came like a train
When all is lost
All is left to gain

And I won't back down

I woke up this morning to a blood red sky
They're burning on the bridge turning off the lights
We're on the run I can see it in your eyes
If nothing is safe then I don't understand
You call me your boy but I'm trying to be the man
One more day and it's all slipping with the sand
You touch my lips and grab the back of my hand
The back of my hand

Guess we both know we're in over our heads
We got nowhere to go and no home that's left
The water is rising on a river turning red
It all might be OK or we might be dead
If everything we've got is slipping away
I meant what I said when I said until my dying day
I'm holding on to you, holding onto me
Maybe it's all gone black but you're all I see
You're all I see

The walls are shaking, I hear them sound the alarm
Glass is breaking so don't let go of my arm
Grab your bags and a picture of where we met
All that we'll leave behind and all that's left
If everything we've got is blowing away
We've got a rock and a rock till our dying day
I'm holding on to you, holding on to me
Maybe it's all we got but it's all I need

You're all I need
And if all we've got is what no one can break
I know I love you

I know there's never gonna be an easy way out
She's rolling round the town with a fast gun
And I know I can't be there to catch her when she falls
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either halfway drowned or half way â??round the pier
When you're that far gone

I walked the steps to her apartment with the window by the shore
And saw her curled on the tile through a crack in the door
I've been searching for the words I don't know how to say
I've been searching for the words to make it go away
I spent all of last night and the night before that
With my feet in the sand and the wind on my back

Watching a ship sail out to a blue wide sea
There must be more than this with a kiss we can't see
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either half way drowned or half way round the pier
I can't break her, I can't break her fall
She's lying in the back room, crying on the bathroom floor
Singing I can't take it, I can't take any more
Just one reason, one to believe in
That's not that far gone
Not that far gone

I held the back of her head and laid her in the bed
And watched the sheets raise and fall to the rhythm of her breath
Turn the lock on the handle and slipped down the stairs
To the cover of the night with diamonds in the air
I'll say a prayer in my breath and take a left at the water
To the rhythm of my feet a sister and a daughter
To the rhythm of the sea with the breeze in the autumn
As it blows through the trees my hands into the water
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either half way drowned or half way round the pier
I can't break her, I can't break her fall
She's lying in the back room, crying on the bathroom floor

The brightest stars are falling down
I'm walking the edge, walking the tightest rope
We can be frank, reality rips on through
Rolling like a hurricane

If everything's falling, if everything's changed
If I'm in the open, if I'm in the way

What am I doing here
If you're not with me
What have I got to live for
If it's just my own dream
When gravity's pulling
You're still holding my heart
You come crashing down
Crashing down

These four walls are closing in on me
The talk is louder than I'll sing
I want to be there, want to be where you are
But you know it all
Every look and smile that aren't meant to break
I'm over the bridge and under the rain

If everything's falling, if everything's changed
If I'm in the open, if I'm in the way

What am I doing here
If you're not with me
What have I got to live for
If it's just my own dream
Take it back to the beginning, back to the start
When gravity's pulling
You're still holding my heart

And you say that everything is different
Why don't we just hold on

The sky's alive with a burning light
You can mark my words something's about to break

And I found myself in a bitter fight
While I've held your hand through the darkest night
Don't know where your coming from, but your coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've ever known or seen

Come on, and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on, and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

And here we go
There's nothing left to choose
And here we go
There's nothing left to lose

So I packed my car and headed east
Where I felt your fire and a sweet release
There's a fire in these hills that's coming down

And I don't know much, but I found you here
And I cannot wait another year
Don't know where your coming from, but you coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've ever known or seen

Come on, and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on, and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

And here we go
There's nothing left to choose
And here we go
There's nothing left to lose

I can still hear the trains out my window
From Hobart street to here in Nashville
I can still smell the pomegranates grow
And I don't know how hard this wind will blow
Or where we'll go

Come on, and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on, and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

Come on, and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on, and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

Come on, and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down watch the world around fly by us

And here we go
There's nothing left to choose
And here we go
There's nothing left to lose",Nothing Left to Lose
Mat Kearney,"The wind hit my back
Cold as I remember
And caught me off guard
In the middle of December
Sometimes a crowded room
Can feel the most alone
Sometimes I wonder
Why you won't pick up the phone

This wall is glaring
And it's too hard for me to climb
I've ran and ran
And now there's nothing left behind
I see a picture of a broken man inside
I tried and tried
And now there's nothing left but time
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you alone
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you alone
Together we will fly tonight
Leave all of the rest behind
I'll wait for you

These hands can feel
Like they're not even mine
A tree and hill and a cry in the night
Sometimes a little step is the greatest divide
Sometimes I feel your breath right at my side

When this wall is glaring
And it's too hard for me to climb
I've ran and ran
And now there's nothing left behind
I see a picture of a broken man inside
I tried and tried
And now there's nothing left but time
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you alone
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you alone
Together we will fly tonight
Leave all of the rest behind
I'll wait for you

Here I am at the edge of the road
One hand on the end of the rope
One crack and it breaks alone
Wondering who's gonna take me home
On my knees when you call my bluff
Begging please from the edge of the rough
I know when I've had enough
And I know it, and I know it

I see a picture of a broken man inside
I've tried and tried
And now there's nothing left but time
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you alone
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you alone
Wait here, stay here
Say you're the only one I need
I know it, I'm holding
Together we will fly tonight
Leave all of the rest behind
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
Wait here, stay here
Say you're the only one I need
I know it, I'm holding
Wait",Wait
Mat Kearney,"'m sure that I'm moving to St. Louis
Three long years wondering here in New York City
I guess I'm looking for the right way to do this
I guess I'm looking for the right things to call pretty
Young boys playing in the park turning their backs to take a shot
You know I'll stay sharp around here'cause they're stoning and leaving type
It's the kind of love that comes and goes when there's company coming around
What's a boy to do who knows no man now?
What's a boy to do who knows no man now?

Daddy's been looking down his nose at all of them
And I've been looking round for someone to tell me who I am
He kept saying I was too young to finish a fight
I'd die each time they came I never got to draw my knife
Well it was just a pair of shoes in a middle school room with the world watching in
An angel is crying I'm dying just a little inside as they ran away
Funny which words stick around 20 years down when you're driving alone
What's a boy to do when there's no man at home?
What's a boy to do when there's no man at home?

Well I'll stack all my books into perfect rows
From the biggest down to the smallest ones
And I buy all the perfect clothes
Bullet proof and black, where I look like a son
Well it was just a rainy night at his house
A bottle spinning around the room
And everybody's singing and slipping down the bottom of a halfway rush of blood
And I was grabbing Missy but I was trying to find the light switch in the dark
What's a boy to do with no man in his heart?
What's a boy to do with no man in his heart?

It's all quiet for the first time
With no voices left to fall
I saw a boy at the bottom of the bridge
His car was left there on the top
It's four o'clock in the morning
Didn't need to be like this
There's a white sheet left to cover up
What should have been a holy kiss
It's not like those days
It's not like I'm scared of you
What's the Son of Man and a boy to do?
What's the Son of Man and a boy to do?",What's a Boy to Do
Mat Kearney,"And all of your ways and all your thunder,
Got me in a haze runnin' for cover,
Where we gonna go from here,
Where we gonna go from here

The carlights in the driveway,
Wonder whos goin, comin' my way
Tomorrow were turnin' down the highway,
With another bright stage, on a weekday
The green grass, and a radio,
Watching it fly past, then away we go,
700 places, 700 faces more

[Chorus]
And all of your ways in all your thunder, 
Got me in a haze runnin' for cover,
Where we gonna go from here,
Where we gonna go from here.

The back of your eyes look like my mothers
When we talk you're like my brother, 
Where we gonna go from here,
Where we gonna go from here.

The time is, movin' on a side,
How could I miss you, to another guy,
Pull up the ocean, and the roarin' tide is
Bigger than my eyes, or my desire
My father, got a best pin, savin' a daughter, for the best man,
700 places, 700 faces more

[Chorus]

Now I've waited and I'll wait some more
Won't see you knockin' on another door
But all this is crazy and amazing
There's only one I've found, us that I'm saving
So I'm praying just to let it go
Watch from a distance just to see you grow
700 places, 700 faces more

[Chorus]",Where We Gonna Go from Here
Mat Kearney,"Here we go at it three years later
Will you help me to dream it all up again
Tired of the same song everyone's singing
Rather be lost with you instead

Don't you come around here
Come around here anymore
Dragging my fears
Dragging my fears
Out the door
All I have
All I have
All I have
Well, you know it's yours
Every breathe
Every step
Every moment
I'm looking for
All I have
All I have
All I have
Is yours
And you watch my heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more

Is it cold yet in New York City?
'Round here the trees been blowing off bare
Everyone's talking about change on the airwaves
I still got you on my breathe

Don't you come around here
Come around here anymore
Dragging my fears

Oh I still trying to do my hardest
Pick us all up from the fall oh
Off the little corner of the darkness
Just a crack the light in the middle of it all

Mat Kearney,"I'm caught in a moment out in the rain
Tell me there's something we can say
Help me to find a light
Something that's worth living
Shes walking the back beat out in the grave
Tell me there's something we can change
Help me to find my way back down

'Cause Annie's got to get out
Before she never can
Were chasing for the ceiling
I'm grabbing for her hand
Were calling on a thin phone line, tonight
Cause Annie's got to get out

Holding the line from the back of the car
Miles and miles from where you are
Maye the hardest things are the dreams that we've been given
And you scream and you sing and you shout
There one way in and there's one way out
Help me to find my way back down

'Cause Annie's got to get out
Before she never can
Were chasing for the ceiling
I'm grabbing for her hand
Were calling on a thin phone line, tonight
'Cause Annie's got to get out

There's one love in the morning
Add three days in the grave
Fall back in the evening
Now our lives will change

Tell me there's something we can say
Help me to find my way back down

Mat Kearney,"This whole city's black and white
Tell me what is your color.
Could it be the same as mine?
Faded greens and blue street lights,
There's a red fire burning
In the sea up to the sky.

I don't want to wait until tomorrow
To tell you how I'd feel the rest of my life
You don't want a waste another minute to realize
Walking on the dark side of the evening
Baby it is you, that opened my eyes
Burning like a fire on the water
The city of black and white.
Won't you just stay?
Won't you just stay?

I'm on the top step looking down
And their coming up to me
It's where the whole world wants to be found
Golden rings and coffee brown
There's white flag waving 
Where my heart is on the ground.

Mat Kearney,"She got the call today
One out of the gray
And when the smoke cleared
It took her breath away
She said she didn't believe
It could happen to me
I guess we're all one phone call
From our knees
We're gonna get there soon

If every building falls
And all the stars fade
We'll still be singing this song
The one they can't take away
I'm gonna get there soon
She's gonna be there too
Cryin' in her room
Prayin' Lord come through
We're gonna get there soon

Oh it's your life
Oh it's your way
Pull me out of the dark
Just to show me the way
Cryin out now
From so far away
You pull me closer to love
Closer to love

Meet me once again
Down off Lake Michigan
Where we could feel the storm blowing
Down with the wind
And don't apologize
For all the tears you've cried
You've been way too strong now for all your life

I'm gonna get there soon
You're gonna be there too
Cryin' in your room

I'll be holding a golden ring

I wait for the whole world to show you
Maybe we're not, not that gone

The rain came down and I lost you, In the wind
You said something about don't leave, before you fell back asleep
Before I could sing my song back to you

But you could find your self lost out in this world
And I found a way to get back to your side
No mountains to high, no stone is too small
I'll build a bridge through the fire, for you I would crawl
From New York to California

I could hear you softly breathing, oh what you do to me
But baby I could climb down into your dreams
I Build a ladder down through the clouds
Where the storms Is raging now I
Don't want to sing another song without you

If you find your self lost out in this world
Then I'll find a way to get back to your side

One road opens and one road ends

Choose one baby your head or your heart
We could not of known it'd go this far
Choose one baby it's the hardest part
Losing one becomes the very start

Tell me have I lost a friend?
Trains are ringing in the yard again
One road opens and one road ends

Mat Kearney,"Meet me in Chicago
Down by the water line
Step across the gold coast
To my heart and to your wine
Maybe Cincinnati
With a trip in the morning light
Step across the branches
I will follow you over the Rhine

And it takes one to know one
That's what they always say
I've waited for the dawn
And I've waited for the day
Oh, I'm coming low
And I'm willing to pray
Stepping through the haze
One more day on a wide open road
On and on and the lights come and go
And everything I might not even know
What is the distance
On through the resistance singing
Oooooooh...

Meet me in Portland
Roast here in the summer light
See you in the evergreens 
I will catch you down on the Northeast side
And maybe San Diego
Moonlight at the lowest tide
See you in the shoreline breaker
Stepping over my maker's line

And it takes one to know one
That's what they always say
I've waited for the dawn
And I've waited for the day
Oh, I'm coming low
And I'm willing to pray
Stepping through the haze
One more day on a wide open road
On and on and the lights come and go
And everything I might not even know
What is the distance
On through the resistance singing
Oooooooh...

You met me on the backstreets
Right there at the end of the line
Where a spark turns into fire
And a tear falls into life

And it takes one to know one
That's what they always say
I've waited for the dawn
And I've waited for the day
Oh, I'm coming low
And I'm willing to pray
Stepping through the haze

Mat Kearney,"She don't know what she wants to be
With all the pictures in the magazines
Holding hands when she's mad at me
'Cause she don't wanna go, don't wanna go

I met her at Anthropologie
Purple boots and her golden dreams
Standing there like a Tennessee queen
Singing, don't look at me, don't look at me

Singing, oh oh
Won't you help me sing this song
Singing, ee ee ee
She don't ever want to go to sleep

Singing, hey mama, don't want no drama
Just a kiss before I leave
Hey lady, don't say maybe
You're the one that I can believe
Hey lover, don't want no other
Finger for my ring

Hey mama, hey hey mama

Hey mama, hey hey mama

Hey mama, hey hey mama

Hey mama, hey hey mama

Oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh

I can see it in her Cherokee eyes
Those baby browns and the golden thighs
What you doing for the rest of your life?
'Cause you don't want to go, don't wanna go

Singing, oh oh
Won't you help me sing this song
Singing, ee ee ee
She's playing like a mystery

Mat Kearney,"Every bridge that you keep on burning
Every leaf that you keep on turning
Every road that you find uncertain
Pray for you now
Baby that you'll figure it out
As you keep chasing the light

Remember back when you slept on my floor
Blow up mattress down by the door
Ten pounds heavier from wasted time
We didn't know we were way out of line
From the moment that you
Popped out on the scene
Hard to know what you got or you're meant to be
Everything that you know goes flying
From Jonny O's couch to a gypsy bus island
Holding hands with people in life
Till they walk away saying no good byes
And you keep saying that you're running down a dream
But you don't know where it leads

As you keep chasing the light
Every bridge that keep on burning
Every leaf that you keep on turning
Every road that you find uncertain
Pray for you now
Baby that you'll figure it out
Every hope and a dream that's dying
Every time that I see you crying
Every step that you keep on climbing
Pray for you now
Baby that you figure it out
As you keep chasing the light

Got the call that you sent out yesterday
Forty lines and a fallout holiday
On my knees with the weight that was mine
Think about you when I'm driving at night
Familiar sounds and it takes me right back there
Bridge street and the beat in the summer air
Was it easier to watch you feet
And never deal with the hell that a young boy sees
Where liquor runs thicker than blood
On your own when push came to shove
Before we had these mouths to feed
With innocent dreams, while you keep

As you keep chasing the light
Every bridge that keep on burning
Every leaf that you keep on turning
Every road that you find uncertain
Pray for you now
Baby that you'll figure it out
Every hope and a dream that's dying
Every time that I see you crying
Every step that you keep on climbing
Pray for you now
Baby that you figure it out
As you keep chasing the light

Remember hearing Dylan's first songs first
Remember writing down a train wreck verse
We were running down Franklin High School lights
Burning alive in a Chevrolet night
Remember driving out to Salton Sea
Dreaming bout all we thought we'd be
One way tickets into southern lights
Slammed the door and said goodbye, goodbye

As you keep chasing the light
Every bridge that keep on burning
Every leaf that you keep on turning
Every road that you find uncertain
Pray for you now
Baby that you'll figure it out
Every hope and a dream that's dying
Every time that I see you crying
Every step that you keep on climbing
Pray for you now
Baby that you figure it out
As you keep chasing the light",Chasing the Light

Two wrong and not enough right
Three words you said in the night
Before we held the fire
High five me brother it's amazing
Her six shooter came out blazing
Seven Up and Coke on the pavement
Ate my heart out daily baby

Hey I love you,
Hey I need you,

Pick you up when you fall be there when you call

Mat Kearney,"It took his breath away holding the bank page
He got the letter they're gonna take their house away
I'm 'bout to have a daughter he yells it in the air
Feeling the weight of a world that just don't care

He lit a cigarette felt it on his lip
Driving home on a long road with regret
He pulls the window down shouts it out loud
Pushing the pedal and praying lord help us now
He's looking for a reason watching the sun coming down

Can you here when we call
There where we fall
Standing our backs against the wall
Top of our lungs hallelujah
Where pain and love bleed into one
Baby when all you see is darkness
It's coming down now
We all need forgiveness
Coming round now

It was Monday night under the street lights
She's turning seventeen in seven nights
Out on the fairgrounds walking in monotone
She kicks a bottle as empty as her soul
On the road alone in a house that's half a home
They give her pills just to kill when she feels alone
She's looking for a reason watching the sun coming down

Can you here when we call
There where we fall
Standing our backs against the wall
Top of our lungs hallelujah
Where pain and love bleed into one
Baby when all you see is darkness
It's coming down now
We all need forgiveness
Coming round now

Take these broken streets
Take these broken dreams
Hold my hand like we we're walking free
Tell me it will change I see it in your face
The hope the fear the love the faith

I'm working late again slaving to make the rent
I'm slanging coffee with dreams heavy as cement
They're coming one by one the face of falling love
I write a song with a prayer as I slide the cups

Can you here when we call
There where we fall
Standing our backs against the wall
Top of our lungs hallelujah
Where pain and love bleed into one
Baby when all you see is darkness
It's coming down now
We all need forgiveness
Coming round now

Can you hear when we call
There were we fall
Standing our backs against the wall
At the Top of our lungs how far we've come
Were pain and love bleed into one
All that we need it's so bitter sweet
The pain that opens our eyes to see
Baby when all you see is darkness
Coming down now
We all need forgiveness
Coming round now
It's coming down now",Down

We've all felt the flame and shed those same tears
Driving home to a one man hell, still counting years, still counting years
Hey brother we're all learning to love again

'Cause that was the real you running through the fields of gold wide open
Standing in places no picture contains
That was the real you, windows down, we could smell the mint fields crying
Singing with the radio to a song we can't name
That was the real you saying, “Maybe I'm not too young to be a cowboy.”
Hey brother, we're all learning to love again
Hey brother, we're all learning to love again

Making up your bed that day on a foreign floor between foreign walls
Thinking 'bout the words you'd say to a phone that never calls
Feel the weight of your father's ring and all those dreams, and all those dreams singing
Hey brother, we're all learning to love again

'Cause that was the real you running through the fields of gold wide open
Standing in places no picture contains
That was the real you, windows down, we could smell the mint fields crying

That was the real you saying, “Maybe I'm not too young to be a cowboy.”
Hey brother, we're all learning to love again
Hey brother, we're all learning to love again

And I know you like I know my reflection
Walking on the water 'cross an ocean of desire
Everyone I know is looking for protection
Trying to pull down your hometown 'cross a telephone wire
'Cross a telephone wire

'Cause that was the real you standing there in the shape of your body
Fear don' know no love when we're all the same
That was the real you looking back across the water
Tears falling like rain, drops rippling against the shame
That was the real you singing hallelujah, looking down a barrel

Mat Kearney,"I was born in Rochester
To a bookmaking man
Had a fake cigar shops
With the games on in the back
See them coming and going
Let them ride on thoroughbreds
Police chief and Tompaw wondering what was the spread
Carried rich men's bag through the brow
Trying to chase down a little white ball
I learned that any soft place wasn't good for me at all
Daddy come home fired up looking for some sort of release
He beat the hell out of Timmy, Timmy beat the hell out of me

I would hop the fence out to this government fields
Run 'til there was nothing more to feel
Lying there watching planes just disappear
Knowing one day I'm gonna fly on out of here

Well that same police chief came knockin' my first freshman day
Put my daddy in handcuffs and put his picture on the front page
To everyone of his suits and all my dignity
Walk the halls around the court waiting for any punk to set me free

I would hop the fence out to this government fields
Run 'til there was nothing more to feel
Lying there watching planes just disappear
Knowing one day I'm gonna fly on out of here

Well I got that call to Vietnam just like everyone else I knew
So scared of the hand grenades threw them farther than any other troop
I came home like an iron fist and Timmy tried to take my keys
Ripped open his front pocket that was the last time he touched me

Moved to an island out west up to Breckenridge
Met a mermaid on a glass boat and she promised me some kids
Bought a house in Oregon where you could touch both of the walls
Had a son named Benjamin and I was so scared of it all
Well Benjamin walked in the front room where I was cutting up my hash
Looked into those deep blue eyes wondering why I'd been so mad
Flushed a quarter pound down the drain praying for the mercy to confess
Trying to rip the boy from Rochester right out of my chest

We're gonna walk right out into these heavenly fields
Run like there was no more time to steal
My three boys in the grace of god I feel
Knowing one day you're gonna take me out of here
Knowing one day you're gonna take me out of here",Rochester
Mat Kearney,"Says she likes me to all of her friends
Cold shoulder's what she pretends
I buy Americano every morning
Rings me up and winks with no warning
At the park with nobody else
Purple boots and her basquiot belt
Lights up when she sees my face
Turns red as she's turning away
All I ever know baby
All these games that you're playing
You keep driving me crazy
Gonna get there, get there

Singing she got the honey and I got some money
To buy her a big bouquet
She got the loving, leaves me with nothing
I just don't know what to say
Well I'd beg, steal, and borrow
If tomorrow she'd stay
She's got the honey
I don't think it's funny
That she keeps walking away
Back to the beginning, back to the beginning

Saw her down at the De La show
Walking in looking down at her toes
Tall like a flower on the wall
High heels stealing looks across the hall
I walk up, she's turning real red now
Deep breath, hi how you doing, wow
Caught you catch the corner of my eye
She got a call, gotta go, goodbye
We're gonna get there, get there

It's amazing that I could be standing tall
It's like a million lighting bolts
When she walks right through the door

To buy her a big bouquet

You keep passing me by
Just wasting time
Trying to prove who’s right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If its just you and me
Trying to find the light

Like ships in the night letting cannonballs fly
Say what you mean and it turns to a fight
Fists fly from my mouth as it turns south
You’re down the driveway
I’m on the couch
Chasing your dreams since the violent fifth grade
Trying to believe in your silent own way
'Cause we’ll be okay, I’m not going away
Like you watched at fourteen as it went down the drain
Your pops stayed the same and your moms moved away
How many of our parents seem to make it anyway
We’re just fumbling through the gray
Trying to find a heart that’s not walking away

Turn the lights down low
Walk these halls alone
We can feel so far

And I was late heading to a red carpet
They wont know my name
Riding in silence
All that we wanna say
'Bout to board when you call on the phone
You say I’m sorry I’ll be waitin’ at home
Feels like we’re burning this out on our own

Down through Manhattan Boulevard and First Avenue
With her black frame glasses and her Daisy perfume
I said, ""Have we met before?"" She said, ""No, it's only noon.""

Rolling round like blankets, oh, this won't last

If I'm honest I fell for you that first night

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Only wanna be with you

You put too much salt on everything you eat
Wake up freezing 'cause I stole the sheets
And you talk to the wall, pop your gum in your sleep
You're the only one
And you worry about your dad on his motorbike
The way your voice cracks when you wanna fight
And you never wanna sleep so I talk all night
To the only one
Turn out the lights and hold me tonight
We don't need the sun
Whatever the weather, we'll stick together forever
'Cause you're the only one

Seven billion in the world baby
I only wanna be with you
I don't want another girl baby
I only wanna be with you
Waiting for you all my life
I can't wait another night
Seven billion in the world
And you're the only I want, it's true

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Only wanna be with you

You're the only one for me
You're the only one I need
Searched the whole world for a while
Looking for your pretty eyes

Seven billion in the world baby
I only wanna be with you
I don't want another girl baby
I only wanna be with you

Seven billion in the world baby
I only wanna be with you
I don't want another girl baby

Mat Kearney,"You've been running with the ghost again
Singing ""It's all gonna fall like we're living a lie""

You've been tearing up these walls again
Ain't no place left here for a girl to hide

You know I tell you just like it is
Gonna walk that far in the scars of another guy

And I'm not gonna give up all of this
Ain't no room left here for me to fly

And if our love is a hurricane
Broken phones and broken doors
Baby you know I can stand the rain
Let it lift us off the floor

You use your words just like a criminal
Kinda like a bullet from a gun
(Young Summer)
Well that shadow found me years ago
I've been bought, I've been shot with a lawless love

And if our love is a hurricane
Broken phones and broken doors
Baby you know I can stand the rain
Let it lift us off the floor

Build it up, tear it down
Let it fall right to the ground
All the words that we could bleed
Let it fly just you and me

Wasted pride
It comes in like the rolling tide
We don't have to give up this fight
But it's too late to give up tonight

I'm waiting for a train that's not coming
It's like a waterfall in my head

Oh won't you tell me why
I keep waiting up at night
Leaving on the lights
Like you never said goodbye?
I hear you at the door
Footsteps on the floor

I hear you blowing in the trees at night

You turn me right round, baby like a forty-five
And I'm feeling every song that this town could write
Well the fire in my head
And the tremor in my chest
Just take one look in my eyes and they will confess

And you are the rhythm of my life, my life

I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
Beating right next to me

You share my name

Mat Kearney,"I was turning nineteen, on a cold December night
Burning like kerosene for nearly half of my life
And I barely had the GPA to make it out of Eugene
You can blame it on me with an ADHD while I'm falling asleep during the SATs
And as I pack my bags and headed to a foreign land
One way ticket on a one way plane
Laying my head down on each night
The same devil's calling and that same old fight
'Cause this one's for middle sons living in the middle love
Where they coming from and a halfway rush of blood
This one's for those first prayers to heaven on a road that seems never ending

For all the heartbreak dreamers waiting for the light
Looking for just one reason to get through the night
Every long lost believer caught in the fight
All the heartbreak dreamers gonna be alright
Everybody sing

And I was turning twenty five in a city that don't sleep
Was feeling only half alive to the dreams that I keep
And I kept on waiting only she's waiting for me
You burning down Maine on a quarter tank of pain with soles off your feet
And you've been waiting and praying for the right one to come
Watch the rise and the falling of another setting sun
Nobody seems quite good enough for you except the wrong one you keep running back to
So this one's for Mike still waiting for his wife
This one's for grandma losing the love of her life
This one's for those first prayers to heaven on a road that seems never ending

For all the heartbreak dreamers waiting for the light
Looking for just one reason to get through the night
Every long lost believer caught in the fight
All the heartbreak dreamers gonna be alright
Everybody sing

And this one right here ah, this is for the fat girls
This one is a, is for the little brothers
This is for the schoolyard wimps, for the childhood bullies who tormented them
To the former prom queen and to the no crate ball players
For the nighttime cereal eaters and the retired elderly Wal-Mart store front door greeters
Shake the dust
This is for the benches and the people sitting upon
For the bus driver's driving a million broken hymns
To the men who have to hold down three jobs simply to hold up their children
For the nighttime schoolers and for the midnight bike riders trying to fly
Shake the dust
This is for the two year olds who cannot be understood because they speak half English and half God
Shake the dust
For the boys with the beautiful, beautiful sisters
Shake the dust
For the girls with those brothers who are going crazy
Those gym class wallflowers and the twelve year-old afraid of taking public showers
For the kid who is always late to class and forgets the combination to his lockers
And the girl who loved somebody else
Shake the dust
This is for the hard men who want love but know that it won't come
For the one's amendments who not stand up for
For the ones who are forgotten
For the ones who are told to speak only when you are spoken to
And then they are never spoken to speak
Every time you stands you do not forget yourself
Do not let one moment go by that doesn't remind you
That your heart beats hundred thousand times a day
And that they have gallons of blood making every one is an Oceans",Heartbreak Dreamer
Mat Kearney,"'Cause it was Bell Biv DeVoe, playing on my radio
And I had Wu-Tang Clan living in my stereo
Mama said we're 6th generation Oregonians
I was rocking in Jordans with reflector tongues
Two kids with wet cement living down in their souls
They say what gets caught when you're young
Stays there when you're old
So misunderstood they say
You're up to no good
And now we're trying our best
To start it over again

If I'd had met you at the playground
Before a hand could tear your world down
Before I slammed down the door and
You said I'm just like my old man
Before I put you in those boxes
And we learned how to disagree
And how your family is a rocket
That blows up in infidelity

For crying out loud I wanna know
How the waves keep on crashing down the doors
Feel the weight of the world and they keep on bringing more
If it's just you and me on the floor
Go grab your coat and I'll drive us home
Like we were just kids
Just, j-j-just kids
J-j-just kids, just, just kids
Like we were just kids
Just kids, j-j-just kids
J-j-just kids, j-j-just kids

Bob Marley was painted on
My high-school walls
But I just disappeared
Into the darkroom hall
Never thought I'd ever
Make it quite this far
Teacher put up my photographs
Say ""son you'll be a star""
It was smoking mirrors
Running down through my veins
I kept on running downtown
Running from God's grace
Every morning I'd climb back through
Those window panes
And try my best to ride it out
Over instrumental tapes

If I'd had met you at the playground
Before a hand could tear your world down
Before I slammed down the door and
You said I'm just like my old man
Before I put you in those boxes
And we learned how to disagree
And how your family is a rocket
That blows up in infidelity

Mat Kearney,"For every time the tears are falling down your face,
For every night you hear those three words start to change,
When you're just close enough to know how far you're away,
Let it rain.

When the heart you've known feels like an empty home,
And your frozen hands just don't feel like your own,
When your love is caving and you don't have the strength to roll back the stone.
There's a time meant for war, there's a time meant to pray,
There's a time

With the sun on my windshield
Black 4Runner in the summer like a big deal
Apron at Starbucks
What you gonna miss, B
Nah, I smiled out, over the Mississippi
Got a friend out west
With a little studio time
Futon in the valley
And the dream gone wild
Ralph's turkey in the pouch
And Ramen in the cup
Check the funds in the account
When the pennies add up
Well, this fire in my chest weighs more like gold
I'm try my best, Lord to let it unfold
For all on the quest
Let the story be told
Right from the soul

Driving the 101
My dream down to the bone
Your smile, your kiss
Every little part I miss
Baby, I'm trying to find a place where we belong

I got a buddy name Shawn
And a minivan too
CDs at our feet
How to tour no clue
Thousand cap room
And only eight people came
And five on the guest list were under my name
But I slayed every one from the bottom of my heart
Maybe there'll be sixteen here next time we start
So move with the wind
Fifty dollars in my pocket
Wait for the sun
That silver-lining rocket
Two traveling souls
Living on the road
To wayward kids livin' how they don't know
So we put it with the wind
We let it all unfold

Twenty K to make a record, now we're walking on a wire
Every favor that I got, I'm cashing in to use
Judson, JoJo, Sy, Lindsey, Robert
Thank You
So, Bullet was made
And I'm scared out my brain
And the song's getting played
And everythin' starts to change
People showing up singing along to what I say
And It feels like we might just be on our way
I think that's Letterman, he just said my name
Check the crowd at the House of Blues
Like they're cardboard fakes
Everyone's livin' out loud
And down their mistakes
And these schizophrenic records that I love to make

Feels like the last day oh of the rest of my life
All that I want to say I never could quite say goodbye

I could hear the short breath that you're breathing
Said darling it's the way we fall, it's the way we fall
Close my eyes and put it in the picture
Carve your name in my heart like a scripture

Your somewhere flying riding up high in the clouds

And I still believe in everything we dreamed that it could be
And I saw headlights shining in the window
Looking down at a phone that never will call

On a corner in the coat that you gave me

Black wings beneath, history repeating
A moment, fleeting, through outside your eyes

How easily I fall for the same old test

And I'll crash this car. 
Do you have to make this so hard? 

You're so good at pretending everything is alright. 
You're as welcome as cancer
But my door is always unlocked.

Hey, how I used to be
How I used to be
Well, I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
How I used to be

Why don't you just go away
I can't seem to get my head straight
There's so much I need to say
It could take all day

Yeah, but what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Your bad mood just ties my hands
Turns my cartwheels into head stands
I've done everything I can
Gave all I have

Ever what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons why

You don't help me none
So warn down, so torn up
Still in love

Yeah, what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Woman, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah bah duh bah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah buh dah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah bah duh bah)
Tell me why (bah dah dah dah bah bah bah buh dah)
Oh, baby, tell me why",All Your Reasons
Matchbox Twenty,"I'll stick around
See how bad it gets
I'll settle down and deal with old regrets
You know I, I adore you

I can't let you go
Can't let you go
You're part of my soul
You're all that I know
I can't let you go

Is it better now
Do you feel like all is fair
Can we work it out
So that it's easier for me to bare
Because life, it can blind you

I can't let you go
Can't let you go
You're part of my soul
You're all that I know
I can't let you go

Down from the edge I can see you where we are
And I'd give up all of my days to go back
There was all this wonder
And all this magic
Has all this wonder, over and done

If love were a whisper
What could I give you to speak
Maybe you're out of my reach

I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You're part of my soul
You're all that I know
I can't let you go

I can't let you go
You're part of my soul
You're all that I know",Can't Let You Go
