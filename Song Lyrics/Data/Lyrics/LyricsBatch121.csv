Fleetwood Mac,"Written by christine mcvie.


You've got a sweet, sweet way
You know you'll always be the only one
And if you'll let me say
You'll never be a lonely one
Well you've just got something
Makes a girl start feeling crazy
And I'll do anything if you'll let me be your baby

Even when everybody tells me
I'm just being a fool
Something inside says I've got to have you
And I can't play by the rules

Ooh baby baby tell me there's a chance for me
'cause I'm crazy about you and I know this is love for me
Well you just got something
Makes a girl start feeling crazy
And I'll do anything if you'll let me be your baby
",Just Crazy Love
Fleetwood Mac,"Written by christine mcvie.


Once in everyone's life
You know a feeling has to grow
And you may be having a bad time
And you really shouldn't let it show
You're taking a risk, but it doesn't matter
'cause you know, you know that it's real
I can't conceal the way that I feel
I can't conceal the way, the way that I feel
How many times have I told you
Oh, I adore you
And if it meant anything at all
I'd do anything for you
But it's too late and I know I'm making
A fool, a fool of myself
But I can't conceal the way that I feel
I can't conceal the way, the way that I feel

There's no use in crying, it's all over
But I know there'll always be another day
Well my heart will rise up with the morning sun
And the hurt I feel will simply melt away

You make me feel, I just can't carry on
But I know I won't always be that way
'cause my heart will rise up with the morning sun
And the hurt I feel will simply melt away

You don't have to give up
Why is it all wrong
Why don't you love me
Why won't you just be strong",Why

I'm a road runner baby
Can't stay in one place too long
I'm a road runner baby

Ohh you're a dream
Hide your head in the sand
You're far away, when I want you around
And you leave me lonely when I'm feeling down

Do your ever wonder, or worry about me
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me
Do your ever wonder, or worry about me
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me

Why is it baby, our love just won't grow
You made me happy but time has gone by
Please leave me softly, I won't say goodbye
So all I wanted slips through my hands
You're far away when I want you around
And you leave me lonely when I'm feeling down

Do your ever wonder, or worry about me
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me
Do your ever wonder, or worry about me
Did I ever love you, did you ever love me

Why baby why are you still so sad
When you know how much I need you
I hate to see you feel so bad
When I try so hard to please you
You know I'd do anything
Just to see you smile againg
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to take away a little pain

You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)

My home is yours and I want you to know
That I need you to depend on
Any everything you feel I'm feeling too
And I just hope you haven't forgotten
How can I make the sunshine through
So we can be happy again
Oh baby there's got to be a way
Just to take away a little pain

You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)
You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh
Dissatisfied (dissatisfied)

Please don't say you don't love me anymore
Cause I couldn't ease up on you
You're the only reason for all my joy
And without you what would I do
Cause I'd do anything
Just to see you smile againg
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to take away a little pain

You make me feel, ooooh ooh ooh oooooh

Is look at me that way

You're feeling the same way to

Not to leave me up in the air

I feel about you
It may not be love
Or an everlasting feeling
But you sending me reeling

Fleetwood Mac,"He had all the rivers, under his power
He had all the mountains, under his command
You know that he had all the cities, in his own two hands
Yes and he had control of the four winds

And of the hunger of starving man
And now we're passing on the reins
'Cause in my heart I can feel the change
You know the lord of light is laughing

'Cause things don't stay the same, 
Revelation, revelation
He controlled the brimstone, and eternal fire
Surrounds himself with downers, in the king of cold

You know that he had all the princes kissing his diamond ring
And I heard that he walled up, the door to summer
And cut the heart out of mister spring
And now we're passing on the reins

And in your heart you can feel a change
You know the lord of light is laughing
'Cause things don't stay the same, 
Revelation, revelation

Dream on, keep your eyes wide open...
On a Sunday morning, with a voice that's cold
The future gives a warning of the fire that burns below
He puts his hands together, cause his faith is strong

And that's what you've been needing
Oh but it don't seem to last too long

Fleetwood Mac,"She came in like a hurricane
 Wearing boots and diamond rings
 With a fox fur on her shoulder
 She set wondering
 And I could tell she was feeling abandoned
 Because she flashed a look across my way
 She said hop for a ride
 You'll never ask me but I'll tell you anyway

 She took me out on the blackboard jungle
 Put me straight in a hurricane
 She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
 If I could sing like Paul McCartney, or get funky like Etta James
 I'd never change, I'd never change, I'd never change silver heeled ways

 She came in and her flags were flying
 She was a sailboat of sweet perfume
 And I could see that her eyes were smiling
 From across the room
 Well I couldn't think of conversation
 I was busy looking at her furs
 She said hey, you'll never ask me
 So I guess I'll say the word

 She took me out on the blackboard jungle
 Put me straight in a hurricane
 She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
 If I could sing like Paul McCartney, and funky like Etta James
 I'd never change, I'd never change, No I'd never change silver heeled ways

As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon

And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion

It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me
And so I followed

As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
I think she knew
The people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel

She asked me
Be my sister, sister of the moon
Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
Wrap her in velvet

Does anyone, ah, know her name
So we make our choices
When there is no choice
And we listen to their voices
Ignoring our own voice",Sisters of the Moon
Fleetwood Mac,"Every night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test

Every day you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much
Is there anything left to say

[Chorus]
Every hour of fear I spend 
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly call inside

I haven't felt this way I feel 
Since many a years ago
But in those years and the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road 
And I did not deal with you I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win

[Chorus]

So I try to say good-bye my friend
Id like to leave you with something more
But never ever been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm

Always been a storm

Oh always been a storm

I have always been a storm

Id be the broken-hearted

For a pot of gold

Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow
As Long as you follow

I've been wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are

And the sun went down
Never seem to rise
Ah, but now you're here
With the light shining in your eyes

Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow

Yes, I can live today
If you give me tomorrow

There's an intenseness
In him, in his eyes

How could that happen anyhow

So how can you say
Well I don't know what love is
You haven't and you have no time for it
You feel completely indifferent
You feel pushed up against the wall
And then one day it just almost goes away
You spend lots of time alone
Sometimes you spend years
And you just miss those arms that used to go around you

Night after night
No questions asked and
Who cares, the cold wind of it all, every time
Well it's hard to be civil and it's
Real hard to be nice
But you did it my love, every time

So how can you say well I can't see you
Not now, not tomorrow, not until it's right
Not until
None of us is pushed up against the wall
I don't know, the cold wind doesn't get you anymore

So today she says well I've changed my mind
That's a woman's right they say
Well I'm frightened and I'm lost and I
Can't give you up, not now I need you now

Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?

A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Now I know just what to do 
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you

She had the Midas touch
She was Lady Luck
She's got a million bucks
And she looks like it
She's had a few hard times
Sometimes it blows her mind
Those papers she never signed
Sometimes she remembers

Sometimes she was just an actress
But you'll never really know
A shadow moves across her face
You cannot see her soul
Unless she lets you
See her soul

She was a girlie girl
Caught in a man's world
And as her world turns
She feels so alone
Still she's a danger girl
Insane far beyond her years
On some things she's very clear
She's a wild adventurer

Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon

And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me

It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me

And so I followed as friends often do
I cared not for love nor money
And I think she knew
Well, the people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel

She asked me, ""Be my sister

You brought me here 
So here's where I belong
Like a fish in a bowl 
The only world I know
I can't stay but I won't go 
Don't tell me that it's over

Makes it hard for anyone to ever want to change

That's why I still take it everywhere I go
All that I love all that I know

Every word I've ever said 
Every thought that's in my head
Marked like money by you 
To never be without you
Layers of my veneer 
Melt away like the years
When I go back to that place 
It's only me in here

To send a message with my mind

Guck mich an, mein Rap ist jetzt so explosiv. 
Der Skandalrapper wieder mal bei Explosive, 
So exklusive ich sorg' für schlechte Publicity, 
Werde nicht Schickimicki wie deine Gang ich disse sie. 
Ein Opfer, ich hab dich mit dem Messer entstellt. 
Ihr seid nicht hart, ihr seid die dümmsten Verbrecher der Welt. 
Ich bin so heiß, heiß und ich burn' wie Lava, 
Du willst Kacke labern, los geh zu Jörg Pillawa. 
Ich bin ein Fernsehstar, jetzt ist mein Hobby verreisen. 
Du willst ins fernsehen, los geh zu Oliver Geißen. 
Du bist im selben Jahr geboren wie dein Opel Vectra. 
Hier kommt die Neue Deutsche Welle und ich flow perfekt, ja. 
Hier kommt mein Gras im Paket und verkauf's dann in Päckchen. 
Wir machen Scheine ohne Ende, ich zieh sie raus wie ein Plättchen. 
Brrrr. Ich schlag sich auf, oh du bist 'ne arme Sau. 
Wir sind der lebende Beweis, Verbrechen zahlt sich aus. 
Ich bin der erste G in den Top Ten Charts. 
Der blonde Türke fickt wie es deine Tochter mag. 
Du hast dein Kopf im Arsch, holst 'nen Rapper aus Bremen, 
Wir sind Berliner und deswegen die besten im Game.
Eyy

Breitem Ring und voll fetten Felgen, die dein Golf blenden
Du wärst gern so schön wie Fler

Ich krieg 'n Abtörn, Görl, was soll ich mit dir (Geh mal weg, hehe, yeah)
Du bist 'n Abtörn Görl

Ich geh zum Blind Date, hoff' es ist 'ne geile Frau
Ich steh am Treffpunkt, was für 'ne dreiste Sau
Sie kommt angewackelt, man wie Kacke sieht sie aus
Was für ein Fettschwein, was für ein Fiech die Braut
Sie schielt mich an, was für ein Elefant
Nicht elegant, so eklig Mann
Sie braucht 'ne Typberatung, sie hat ein Doppelkinn
Weil das Opferkind jeden Burger doppelt nimmt
Oink, Oink, das Schwein da kriegt kein Freund, Freund
Ich lass sie abblitzen, guck mal wie sie heult, heult
Sie stank so übel, die Bitch, hat so übel geschwitzt
Und hatte locker um die 80 Kilo Übergewicht

Es gibt Frauen mit Verstand, Frauen mit Charme
Doch irgendwie krieg ich nur die mit zu viel Haaren
So wie letztens die Braut an Silvester
Kein Scheiß, die sah aus wie Reinhold Messner
So mit Fell auf'm Rücken, wie ein Yeti
Und ich dachte wenn ich nein sage, versteht sie
Sie hat geweint, sie hat gedacht, dass ich sie liebe
Doch ihr Zickenbart am Kinn macht mir ?
Sie war so unendlich unmenschlich haarig
Dachte das Monster etwa das stört mich gar nicht
Es liegt an euch, Ladys, macht euch interessant
Valezka hat es fast erkannt: Neue Frauen braucht das Land

Du bist 'n Abtörn Görl

Ich krieg 'n Abtörn, oh sie ist emanzipiert
Will mir irgendwas erklären, und eh man's kapiert
Ist sie wieder anderer Meinung, sie ist kompliziert
Ich krieg 'n Abtörn, muss weg von hier, weg von ihr
Du sagst sie fickt jetzt mit Dir
Ich sag trotzdem diese Nutte hat kein Sexappeal
Ich krieg 'n Abtörn von ihrer SMS
Weil sie will, dass ich mich mit ihr zum Essen treff'
Ich krieg 'n Abtörn, denn sie hat kleine Titten
Ich krieg 'n Abtörn, wenn sie weint und nicht schreit beim Ficken
Es törnt mich ab, wenn sie die Beine spreizt
Und es stinkt als wär' ihre Muschi Schweinefleisch
Ey

Es törnt mich ab, wenn Sie immer das letzte Wort hat (Nänänä)
Und immer am lautesten schreit, als wär's ne Sportart
Es törnt mich ab, wenn sie geht wie ein Mann
Redet wie ein Mann, mein Gott ekelt sie mich an
Es törnt mich ab, wenn sie trinkt wie ein Loch (Gluck)
Oder wenn ihr Stöhnen klingt wie ein Frosch(Quark)
Wenn sie fett ist und es ihr nichts ausmacht
Oder sie nicht gleich ficken will, wenn sie aufwacht (Yeah)
Ich könnte kotzen, wenn ihr Essen mir nicht schmeckt (Ha)
Und sie mich weckt, nur weil sie sich im Schlaf erschreckt
Oder wenn sie lieber TooShort als Pac hört
Das sind so Sachen die mich an 'ner Frau abtörn'

Sie ist'n Abtörn Görl, ich seh's dir an
Du bist'n Abtörn Görl, geh mal weg

Fler,"Alle wird gut

Yay, zieh's durch!
Da wo wir herkommen gibt's kein Plan B!
Fler und G-Hot!

Mein erster Gedanke, ich sehe wie mein Vater meine Mutter schlägt
Die Sonne für mich unter geht, ein Junge der im Dunkeln steht
Ich wollt nur raus, raus zu meinen Kumpels gehen
Doch muss bald los, mit meiner Mama Nummer ziehen
Ich war auf sieben Schulen und hab's nie gepackt
Doch ich hab gesagt man ich zieh es durch in dieser Stadt
Hab auf den Straßen was gelernt, vertraue keinem Menschen
Und sei jetzt dankbar für die Gnade des Herren
Ich hab mein Ziel vor Augen, ich weiß ich mach es klar
Ich war der Typ der noch vor fünf Jahren in der Klappse war
Und jetzt schaut mich an; ich bin der Bulle der neben Sido steht (Was?)
Ich bin der Teufel, den jetzt abends nur ein ? steht
Ich war im Heim doch hab es raus geschafft
Ich hab Angst, dass ich immer aus 'nem Traum erwach'
Wie ist es alles gekommen, es hat sich neu verformt
Denn jeder Augenblick im Leben ist 'ne neue Chance!
Ich geb' mein Geld aus, denn Fler ist krass
Ich geh' mit G-Hot zur micicon zur Airforce One
Krieg Prozente, denn ich bin der Beste
Weil ich bis zur Rente meine Clique represente
Ich bin gesegnet, das ist mehr als Musik
Das ist Flers Musik, das ist Fler sein Lied
Ich komme G-Hot zu krass, so smooth
Und sag auch ihm, 
Ey, Junge! Glaub mir, Alles wird gut!

Alles wird gut, denn wir nutzen den Tag
Jede Stunde, jede Woche, jeden Monat im Jahr

Alles wird gut, solang sich die Erde dreht
Wir sind die ersten die kommen und die letzten die gehen

Alles wird gut, denn irgendwann alles kommt zurück
Und Jeder kriegt was er verdient doch nur Stück für Stück

Und alles wird gut, nenn' es wie du willst
Ist es Gott oder Schicksal der nur du selbst

Schon mit zehn wollt ich nicht mehr bei meinen Eltern wohnen
Ich bin ein Ghettokind, ich hab mich selbst erzogen
Ich habe Geld gestohlen, mir wurde nichts geschenkt
In meinem Sparschwein waren früher nur 50cent
Eine arme Familie in einem reichen Staat
Wir hatten kein Geld für mich und meine Klassenfahrt
Mir wurde nichts innen Arsch gesteckt wie Richi Rich
Ich hab früh gelernt, was für mich wichtig ist
Meine Leute vom Block, meine Freunde vom Block
Zusammen teilen wir unsre Träume vom Block
Wer den Cent nicht ehrt ist den Benz nicht wert
Die Steine, das Auto was ein Gangster wär'
Meine Mama hat gesagt ich hab mein Leben verkackt
Auf einmal rap' ich bei den Nägeln,  mit dem Sägeblatt
Ich bin nicht reich geboren, vielleicht im andern Leben
Doch reich geworden, Fler hat mir die Hand gegeben
Du stehst um sieben auf, ich geh um sieben schlafen
Ich brauche gut viel Geld und fahr 'nen Mietwagen
Ich lass' den Beat schlagen und nach vier Tagen
Müsst ich etwa deinen Monatslohn verdient haben
Noch vor zwei Jahren war ich ein verlorener Junge
Ich hab nicht aufgegeben, weil ich nach vorne gucke
Und jetzt guckt mich an, Straßenträume werden wahr
Jetzt bin ich Rapstar, mach deine Perle klar

Alles wird gut, denn wir nutzen den Tag
Jede Stunde, jede Woche, jeden Monat im Jahr

Alles wird gut, solang sich die Erde dreht
Wir sind die ersten die kommen und die letzten die gehen

Alles wird gut, denn irgendwann kommt alles zurück
Und Jeder kriegt was er verdient doch nur Stück für Stück

Und alles wird gut, nenn' es wie du willst

Guck', Ich hab angefangen vor vier Jahren, wollte es schaffen,
Wollte mit achtzehn damals, schon 'ne goldene Platte.
Ich war ein Amateur, alles war schwer, die Kasse war leer,
Ich war so lang' im Heim, denn ich hatte keine Mama mehr.
Der Stress war mies, ich hatte Stress im Kies,
In Westberlin, wo Bullen auf den ""Assbuck"" schießen.
Hab die Trains gebombt, mit dem besten Team,
Der Fame ist gekommen, doch ich hab' kein Cash verdient.
Ich hab' tausend Bilder gemacht, 'ne Ausbildung gemacht,
Bushido kennengelernt, bei ihm zu hause Lieder gemacht.
Wollte nicht Mecker, war nur der Back-Up-Rapper,
Nur der deutsche Junge, nur dieser Patrick Decker.
Ich hatte Menge Ideen, hab' ihm 'ne Menge gegeben.
Jetzt klaut er nicht nur meine Raps, sondern bitet mein Leben.
Es war so so Shit, er machte Soloshit,
Dachte nicht an seine Leute bei dem Promoshit.
Er wurde gesignt, ich blieb in meiner Wohnung allein,
Allein beim Rhymen, da fiel mir dieser Chorus ein
Carlo Cokxxx bis zur Skyline, Gordon Sport Massenmord,

Und dein Freund mich enttäuscht, also her mit dem Mic.
Ich muss für Klarheit sorgen, muss die Wahrheit sagen,
Im Damenchat im Internet ham sie garkein' Plan.

Über mich schreiben, ihr Biter seit so übel dabei.
Das ist mein Albumdebüt, das hier ist Loyalität,
Aggro Berlin, dieses Team geht seinen eigenen Weg.
Ihr kriegt 'ne Macke, egal wie viel Hits ich mache,
Ich bin ein Macker, als wäre es meine dritte Platte.
Ihr macht euch lächerlich, ihr seit nicht besser als ich,
Du bist kein OG, ich seh's an deinem netten Gesicht.
Ich war mit zehn in der Klapse, war mit zehn schon der krasse,
Ging zum ""Kaiders"" um die Ecke, und dann da an die Kasse.
Jetzt hol' ich Gold, bevor mein Album erscheint,
Hab' mit zweiundzwanzig Jahren, mehr als ihr alle erreicht.

Fler,"Das ist meine Mentalität mit dem Kopf durch die Wand bis ihr's endlich versteht.
Das ist meine Mentalität, die Art wie ich leb', ein Gangsta von früh bis spät.
Das ist meine Art und Weise, das bin ich, wie ich bin, wie ich war und bleibe.
Das ist meine Mentalität für mich kommt jede Hilfe zu spät.

Ich bin ein Dickschädel,
Ich scheiß' auf jede Regel auch,
Wenn ich merke, ich steh' mir manchmal selbst im Wege.
Ich hab mir viel verkackt durch mein Temperament.
Ich bin ein Macho, bin der, der das Lenkrad lenkt.
Ich sag was ich denk, glaub mir ich änder' mich nie
Und wenn es Deutschland nicht passt, meine Gang ist fies.
Wir bangen MC’s.
Leute nennen mich den Husky,
Blaue Augen, Chinchilla Pelz, ich bin ein Asi,
Ich dreh durch, ich verprügel' MC’s.
Sie sagen, ich soll chillen doch ich bin hyperaktiv.
Ich gebe Hundert Prozent, dieser Rap hier ist astrein,
Rede über mich und ich schieb' dir mein Ast rein.
Ich bin ein Alki und ich nehme Drogen,
Doch nur aus Wut auf die Lehrer und die Pädagogen,
Nur aus Wut auf den Staat und auch auf mich selbst,
Bei mir ist es wirklich so ich bin jung und brauche das Geld.
Ich brauche es schnell immer wieder, denn ich geb' es gleich aus.
Die guten Rapper sterben früh, darum geh ich bald drauf.
Ich hab meinen eigenen Willen, ich kann nicht einfach chillen,
Ich bin der Hauptdarsteller in meinem eigenen Film.

Das ist meine Mentalität, die Art wie ich leb', ein Gangsta von früh bis spät.

Das ist meine Mentalität für mich kommt jede Hilfe zu spät.

Ich hab die Hände voller Namen, hab mich oft geschlagen.
Der Stacheldraht macht die Jeans kaputt, wenn dich Cops jagen.
Ich konnt mich nie vertragen, wollte bloß nach oben
Doch nach dem Heim erstmal ins betreute Einzelwohnen.
Ich war alleine, hatte keinen, der mir zeigt wo lang.
Ich hatte Feinde, doch ich fickte sie im Einzelkampf.
Das ist der Alltag, jeder ist am Scheiße bauen.
Meine Lehrer meinten, Junge du gehst bald in Bau.
Doch egal, so ist das Leben, wenn Kumpels sich stechen.
Du gehst unter, unter im Sumpf des Verbrechens.
In den Ferien seid ihr alles Ski gefahren,
Ich machte Urlaub in Berlin auf der schiefen Bahn.
Mach kein Heckmeck, sonst macht's Klicki klack klack, du keck Rap.
Doch ich geb' dir kein Respekt,
Du willst ihn haben? Du musst ihn dir verdienen.
Du willst hier verdienen am Block,
Dann musst du wie wir dealen mit Gras, E’s und auch all dem harten Zeug.
Ich bin Berliner, du willst reden, dann sprich Straßen-Deutsch.
Guck mich hat diese Scheiße geprägt,
Denn das ist meine Mentalität!

Fler,"Ich zeig' dir die Realität, das ist meine Straße.
Hier sprechen wir 'ne eigene Sprache.
Komm her, ich zeig' dir meine Welt,
Hier hat der gewonnen, der die meisten Scheine zählt.
Ich bin kein Abiturient und fahr von Papi 'nen Benz.
Ich hab' die Trains gebombt und hab' 'ne Party geschwänzt.
Du bist kein Nazi hier, wenn du 'ne Glatze hast.
Es ist egal, ob du Kanake oder Japse sagst.

Ich konnt' mit 10 meine Pornos sehen.
Das ist der Grund, warum wir mit Hoes wie in Pornos reden.
Ihr beschimpft euch mit Blödmann, wir schreien, Hurensohn!
Du hast Pech, wir sind nicht gut erzogen.
Ich konnt' mich nie politisch korrekt artikulieren.
Ich wollt' auf der Straße hängen und kein Mathe studieren.
Ich wollt' die Waffe polieren und meinen Überfall planen.
Jetzt hat jeder Alarm, weil wir schon überall waren.

Ich hab' vor zwei Jahren nur für mich und meine Gegend gerappt.
Nur für die, die hier leben, die die Regeln hier kennen.
In Berlin ist es hart man, wir reden mit Slang, leben in Gangs,
Probleme regeln wir selbst und auf einmal hört ein ganzes Land mir zu.
Die Eltern hassen mich, die Kinder finden mich spannend und cool!
Doch, wenn es Nacht wird, machst du dich besser vom Acker,
Hier gibt es Mord und Totschlag,
Hier zerfetzen dich Punker, mit Messer und Hammer.
Ihr könnt's nich' nachvollziehen, hier leben deutsche in der Minderheit, 
Der Stress ist unfassbar.
Kleine Mädchen müssen hier zum Drogenentzug,
Sind mit 12 Jahren schwanger und haben Drogen im Blut.
Ihr habt kein Plan von der Jugend, ich sprech' die Sprache der Jugend,
Und war der schlechte Einfluss und nie brav in der Schule.
Yeah!
Ihr habt uns zu lange ignoriert, wir mussten's selber machen,
Nun sind wir in, guck' hier!

In meinem Leben musst' ich eben so viel scheiße erleben 
Und deswegen leb' ich ewig alleine mein Leben.
Gerade eben standen wir zwei noch beide im Regen und auf einmal is' die Chance da, 
Ich greif' sie und geh'.
Ich muss nach vorn', nach vorn' muss die Scheiße hier regeln.
Scheiß' auf Fans, auf Politiker und scheiß' auf die Medien.
Ihr könnt uns zwei nich' verstehn', doch wir fighten dagegen,
Denn wir leben unser Leben, nach eigenen Regeln.

Wenn du nach oben willst, hast du keine Zeit für Gefühle.
Ich sag' immer die Wahrheit, sogar wenn ich lüge.
Zeig' mit dem Finger auf mich, das ist der Bösewicht,
Du bist nur 'ne Marionette, du blöde Bitch.
In meiner Stadt, vergeht die Zeit wie im Flug.
Existensen gehen kaputt, weil es keiner versucht.
Keiner hat Mut, (Shit), komm' und nutze den Tag,
Denn vielleicht is' morgen alles schon kaputt und am Arsch.

Das Leben ist 'ne Nutte (Bitch), sie wird gebummst und das war's.
Ich nehm' jetzt G-Hot und stürm' mit meinen Kumpel die Charts.
Ihr habt uns zu lange ignoriert, wir mussten's selber machen,
Nun sind wir in, guck' hier!

Meine Heimat ist Berlin, eine Welt für sich
Denn sie blendet jede andre Stadt in grelles Licht
Die Straße scheint, wir tragen Königsketten
Wenn wir sie löhnen wenn wir betteln, weil wir böse rappen
Wir treiben uns rum, haben die Schule geschwänzt
Rum gestresst, denn jeder war im Jugendarrest
Hat einen Gerichtstermin
Das hier ist Berlin
Deutsche wollen in diese Stadt, doch haben's nicht verdient

Waren nur ein zwei Stunden in dein kleines Kaff
Doch wir nehmen euch die Schmach wie ein eigenes Land
Es ist unglaublich, man sieht Blaulicht überall
Hier ist Silvester schon am ersten Mai
Und fast jeder hat bewirkt was mit großen Tabu
Mit deinen Fehlern am Block von den Bullen im Zug
Die Lichter brennen wenn das Nachtleben losbricht lichterloh
Groupies werden hier bedroht
Ich wünsch' mir die Mauer zurück
Wenn du nicht raust kommst, wir laufen ein Stück
Jeden Tag gibt es neue Probleme (Doch keine Lösung)
Willkommen in meiner Gegend

Willkommen in Berlin, in der Stadt der Probleme
Das hier ist Berlin, diese Stadt in der ich lebe
Man steht in Berlin, Sport man die Macht der Straße
Es gibt keine Konkurrenz, wir sind einzigartig

Willkommen in Berlin, wir haben die größte Schnauze
Das hier ist Berlin, das hier ist mein Zuhause
Weil ich lieb Berlin und hasse dein beschissenes Kaff
Aus der Gosse in die Charts wir sind die Kinder der Nacht

Willkommen in meiner Stadt wo die Nacht zum Tag wird
Wo die Spack die grad' turnt nachts im Park stirbt
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht mach dich rar, Knirps
Blas' die Bars mit einer dieser Hits, die im Lauf liegt
Spits bis sie auffliegt, spit bis mein Licht in den Rauch zieht
Spit ich vernichte dich auch, Freak!
Du bist es nicht gewohnt, hockst den ganzen Tag im Dorf rum
Wo wir herkommen ist Hass oft an der Tagesordnung
Pack' die Rapsticks um ich mach Business
Hinter verschlossenen Türen wie Kabinettssitzung
Wie die Mücken auf der Bank in Bronx
Oder bar auf die Hand, oder ganz in Fonds.
Für den Rolls Royce und das Stückchen Land in France
Deine starken Strahlen strahlen wie Lampions
Und du boxt dich von unten durch
Auch wenn der Shit den du bringst nicht stimmt bist du unten durch

Meine Fans fragen mich Alter, 
Fler, wann kommt deine Antwort, Alter? 
Zu den ganzen Disstracks Alter gegen dich? und ich sag meinen Fans, 
„Habt Geduld, es braucht Zeit , wenn man so viel Geld zählt wie ich jeden Tag, 
Es braucht Zeit, wenn man so viele Hits schreibt wie ich jeden Tag“ 
Aber hier ist der Track für meine Fans, hier ist die Antwort

Die Uhr sie rattert jetzt gibt’s soni Massacker,
Ich cruis’ und baller' mit Kugeln bist du blutest du Bastard,
Ich hab genug gechillt um unser’ alter Freundschaft willen,
Doch muss dich leider enttäuschen ich wird dich heut’ Nacht killen
Ihr habt genug gelogen, habt die ganzen Fakten vertauscht,
Ich raste aus und box’ dir heute deine Akne aus dem Maul, du Homo,
Ich kick’ die Bässe gerade, schmier' dir Wichse in die Haare,
Du bist der Verräter, Du lutscht Schwänze in der Chefetage.
Du bist nicht hart du Schlumpf, Du wirst mit dem Part gebumst,
Das ist kein Waschbrettbauch, nein das ist Magersucht
Der Gangster bin Ich
Guck’ ma' sie rappen wie ich
Doch hängen auf dem Strich, und lutschen tausend Schwänze für nichts.

Wenn ich komm dann dreh' dich lieber um,
Ich hab lang gechillt doch heute geht es rund
Ich sag den Fans die Wahrheit und du hältst den Mund,
In dieser Großstadthektik kommt man leichter um.

Denn ich hab nachgeladen und ich schieß’,
Wechsel die Straßenseite wenn du mich siehst,
Ich bin nicht nett Boy, nein ich bin nicht lieb,
Ich bin A.G.G.R.O Gee.

Spiel deine Rolle Gee und du bist nur ein Trottel wie,
Der Rest von deiner Gang ihr seid Stranger als Scientology
Ihr glaubt die Lügen, und dein Major regelt’s für dich,
Ich schäm’ mich für dich, wegen dir ist Rap jetzt ekelig, du Bitch.
Du hängst an der Bong, du Spast jetzt schreibt dir Eko die Songs
Du fakest die Votes bei TRL, hast so dein Echo bekommen,
Doch deine Fans sind geblendet, nein du bist Faker als Sentence,
Du bist ein Kinderficker, scheiße, Du hast AIDS doppel Anis
Keiner glaubt dir deine Lügen, weil du auf Gangster tust,
Weil du dir Gangster rufst, machst keine Gangstermoves
Tanzt für die Kumpels jetzt Gogo wie auf den Strumpfhosenfoto,
Du schuldest Spector noch n’ Tausender für dein komisches Logo

Wenn ich komm dann dreh' dich lieber um,
Ich hab lang gechillt doch heute geht es rund
Ich sag den Fans die Wahrheit und du hältst den Mund,
In dieser Großstadthektik kommt man leichter um.

Denn ich hab nachgeladen und ich schieß’,
Wechsel die Straßenseite wenn du mich siehst,
Ich bin nicht nett Boy, nein ich bin nicht lieb,

Mit deiner Freundin und deiner Cousine.
Du hast schon so viel gehört über unsre Sessions.

Du würdest alles dafür tun um dabei zu sein.
Backstageparadies, Alkohol und weiße Lines.
Ich weiß' du willst dich einfach gehen lassen.
Dein Freund draußen im Regen stehen lassen.
Du willst ein Autogramm auf deine Nippel haben
Du wirst immer feuchter bei jedem mal wenn ich ficken sage.

Sie ist so fresh, sie ist so geil, doch ihr fehlt ein bisschen Style.
Dazu high und nich' brünett, doch Hauptsache sie ist klein,
Sie ist tight, weiß Bescheid, ist bereit für jeden scheiß.
Sie ist heiß in ihrem Kleid und mach bestimmt die Beine breit.
Bei jeden auftritt hat sie ein neues Outfit.
Dick gepresste große Titten gucken aus ihrem Ausschnitt.
Sie macht sich auffällig, denn ich bin ihr Traummann.
Sie wackelt den Arsch, weil sie so sexy mit dem Bauch tanzt.
In ihrer kleinen Stadt gibt es leider nur Dorftrottel.
Sie will in Backstage, lässt sich dafür sofort poppen.
Das sind so leichte Mädchen, die meistens alleine leben.
Glaub mir, das sind solo Bitches, die es dir vom feinsten geben.
Du bist jetzt unsre Bitch, gib Bobby ein Kuss Chicita,
Du kriegst 'nen dicken Fick von Fler mit einem Schuss Tequila.

Shake dein Popo, tanz Gogo, ich mach dann von dir Nacktfotos,
Und als Gegenleistung darfst du Bitch dann an mein Schwanz, Logo.

Du bist ein böser Engel trotzdem lieb' ich dich.
Ich bin überall. Wieso übersiehst du mich? Warum?
Ich bin hängen geblieben dachte es geht vorbei.
Du hast mein Herz gebrochen für die Ewigkeit.

Ich hab' mich jeden Tag auf den Bus gefreut,
Du standest an der Haltestelle wenn du mich
Ansahst traf mich der Blitz wie eine Schelle.
Ich sah dich an es war wie Liebe auf den ersten Blick.
Ich wollte der erste sein der dich kriegt
Und dich als erstes fickt.
Du warst in meiner Klasse ich wollte kleine Zettel schreiben
„Willst du mit mir gehen
Bitte kreuze an ""Ja oder Nein"".
Wir waren auf Klassenfahrt saßen da am Lagerfeuer.
Ich hab' mich nicht getraut ich hatte zu viel Paranoia.
Ich wollte zeigen, dass du für mich was besonderes bist,
Ich wollt's dir sagen doch ich hatte einfach zu viel Schiss.
Ich wollt dich anbaggern damals in der Party Nacht
Doch war zu besoffen und der Typ hat dich dann klar gemacht.

Du bist ein Böser Engel trotzdem lieb' ich dich.
Auch wenn es blöd klingt ich sing' dieses Lied für dich.
Ich bin hängen geblieben komm nicht mehr los von dir.

Ich bin überall. Wieso übersiehst du mich? Warum?
Ich bin hängen geblieben dachte es geht vorbei.
Du hast mein Herz gebrochen für die Ewigkeit.

Du hattest jetzt 'nen Freund doch es war mir scheißegal.
Er war ein reicher Bonze und ich war der der pleite war.
Doch ich hatte jetzt einen Plan wie ich dir mal schnell imponier'.
Und es hat funktioniert und du nahmst mich mit zu dir.
Es war 'ne coole Zeit wir chillten in den Sommerferien.
Du warst mein Engel ich habe jeden Abend zu Gott,
Gebetet, dass es was ernstes wird.
Du hast mich zappeln lassen dann hab ich bei,
Dir geschlafen und durfte deinen Arsch anfassen
Ich hab dich geküsst und du hast gestöhnt dir hat’s gefallen
Du hast mich an dich ran gezogen und machtest deine Beine breit.
Es war 'ne geile Zeit du wolltest von mir Kinder haben bis
Dein Freund eines Tages davon Wind bekam.

Du bist ein Böser Engel trotzdem lieb' ich dich.
Auch wenn es blöd klingt ich sing' dieses Lied für dich.
Ich bin hängen geblieben komm nicht mehr los von dir.
Ich könnte jede haben doch träum' nachts bloß von dir. Yeah
Du bist ein Böser Engel trotzdem lieb ich dich. Du Schlampe
Ich bin überall. Wieso übersiehst du mich? Sag Warum?
Ich bin hängen geblieben dachte es geht vorbei. Niemals
Du hast mein Herz gebrochen für die Ewigkeit. Yeah

Als erst dann wusste, kam dein Freund und wollte mich
Schlagen dir war’s egal denn du hattest dich mit ihm vertragen
Er wollte mir auflauern normal ich wär' auch sauer
Doch scheiß egal dieser Bauer hatte kaum Power
Du hast davor erfahren und hast mich nicht vorgewarnt
Es hätte schlimmer enden können ich hätte jetzt 'nen Mord am Arsch, Nutte
Du warst 'ne Feige Sau hieltst dich aus der scheiße Raus.
Ich war 'nen halbes Jahr wegen dir nur Scheiße drauf
Jeder ging sein weg und ich hab’s dann mehr und mehr
Geschafft, hab dich mehr und mehr geliebt hab dich mehr und mehr gehasst.
Ich hab seitdem nichts von dir gehört, ist schon verrückt
Weil mein Herz heut' noch dir gehört, du Schlampe

Du bist ein Böser Engel trotzdem, lieb' ich dich.

Du hast mein Herz gebrochen für die Ewigkeit. Yeah

Yeah
Und was ist jetzt du Schlampe alda?
Ich hoffe du bereust es alda das du dich damals
Für den Bonzen Jungen entschieden hast alda.
Ich war dir ja nicht gut genug alda ich war ja nur ein Heimjunge alda.
Aber ich hab’s geschafft ich bin jetzt ein Star, ich kann jetzt jede haben.
Ich hoffe du ärgerst dich alda,
Ich hoffe du siehst mich im Fernsehen
Und ärgerst dich alda.

Du Opfer, meine Lehrer war'n die Pornofilme und der Kiez,
Und das hier ist der Unterschied warum mich niemand unterkriegt.
Ich überspann den Bogen, trinke Alk, nehme Drogen, 
Mach mir das nicht nach sonst kriegst du Ärger mit den Pädagogen. (Oh)
Das ist zu krass Boy, Schule ist wie Knast Boy,
Ich hass' Mathematik, Physik, man ich hass' Deutsch. 
Wir wollen ein Neuanfang,
Fackeln das Gebäude an, Alle
Schau dir dieser Feuer an.

Die Schule brennt, denn ich hab die Hits dabei, Fler
Und jetzt ist Hitz, Hitz, Hitzefrei.

Ich schein' wie ein licht in der Nacht
Ich schein' wie die lichter der Stadt Ich
Ich schein' wie ein Wolkenkratzer 
Jedes Fenster strahlt auf den Kopfsteinpflaster Scheine
Ich schein' wie Sirenen am block
Wenn die Bullen kommen ich scheine durch den Nebel und Smoke
Und ich schein' das nur einer scheint alleine scheint schein' auf 
Schein' ich scheine auf Scheine

Ich scheine auf scheine ich stappel' die scheine
Du gehst drauf läufst du hier in dieser Gegend alleine
Du siehst hier dunkle Gestalten (Gestalten)
Die mit Drogen dealen und Kapseln ziehen ihre Freizeit gestalten
Das ist nicht Hollywood nein ich bin kein Schauspieler
Soziale Missstände ein Mann boxt seine Frau nieder
Und ihr wollt sowas lieber nicht sehen du bist naiv den du hast es nie auf VIVA gesehen
Das ist die Realität und ihr verschließt die Augen wenn Kinder kiffen und rauchen
Eltern die Kids missbrauchen jeder zweite hat sich hier seine Zukunft verbaut
Träumt von'em Pool und ´nem haus geht geht an´ner Kugeln dann drauf
Egal was du suchst es wird dir an der schule verkauft
Es ist hitzefrei Stecherei sie bluten am Bauch
Ich bin der Nachtfalke komm wenn die Stadt schon schläft
Und am nächsten tag bin ich dann das Stadtgespräch
Deine Kiddys reißen raus und scheißen drauf
Und haben Hunger sind verzweifelt rauben Kaisers Haus
Du siehst boombing Sex und der Himmel wird grau
Und dieser Star hier scheint bis in den Himmel hinauf

Ich schein' wie ein licht in der Nacht

Schein' ich scheine auf Scheine

Schein auf schein' ich stappel' 
Die scheine leg was bei Seite und guck dann welchen stappel' ich teile
Ich steh mir auch wenn es dunkel wird
Und zähl die Stunden bis dann wieder mal ein Kumpel stirbt (Tschüss Maxim)
Doch ich schein' wie ein Rotlichtviertel
Breitling, Viertelcap, Guccigürtel deine Homies würden dich im Schlaf erwürgen
Meine würden sich für mich verbürgen
Eine Hand wäscht die andere keine bleibt sauber
Du kommst hier bloß raus wenn du irgendwie was drauf hast
Du beißt dich durch machst krume Geschäfte
Weil die Armut diese Jugend verpestet
Das hier ist nicht wie bei GZSZ
Wenn du als Leiche in der BZ endest
Die Uhr tickt und deine Zeit verschwendest
Bist du spätestens mit 18 im 'nem scheiß Gefängnis
Tja alles kommt immer anders als man denkt
Freunde trauern weil wieder ein Verwandter sich erhängt
Keiner kriegt hier was geschenkt, kämpf' um die scheine
Ich hab gekämpft und ich Scheine

Fler,"Ich kam auf die Welt als ganz normales Einzelkind
Und hab schnell gemerkt,was falsche Freunde sind
Doch ich hatte Glück, 2000 kam die Wende
Das war die Zeit nach dem Heim und den Angstzuständen
Als hätte Gott mir ein Engel geschickt
Ohne Shizoe wär' ich heute noch plem plem und verrückt
Du hast dir Zeit genommen und hast mich durchgefüttert
Ich war gefangen in mir selbst, du kamst durch die Gitter
Für meine Homies, die mit mir am Start sind
Ich ging zu Spaiche, unterschrieb' den Vertrag blind
Du hast gesagt du bist der Ehrlichste im Bizz
Und hast mich nicht enttäuscht, mein Fame zeigt, wie ehrlich du bist
Danke Specter, du bist mein Mentor
Dein Krieg ist mein Krieg,ich schiess' und schrei' yes yor
Mit dir bomb' ich jeden Train mein freund
Nur mit dir geh ich durchs Game mein Freund
DJ Perres du stehst hinter mir
Ich bin vor dir, doch im Leben steh ich hinter dir
Lass auf Tour gehen, denn keiner macht uns beide platt
Macht einer Faxen, dann schneid ich ihm die Beine ab
Sido hat mich gepushed bis ganz nach oben
Tut mir leid das ich nicht bei war,beim Hip Hop Open
Ich hätt' mich mitgekeilt, hätt für dich ausgeteilt
Du bist mein Homeboy,mit dir wird jede Frau geteilt

Für meine Homies schreib ich ein lied ,ihr seid es wert
Für meine Homies ich bleib bei euch,ihr bleibt bei fler
Für meine Homies,ihr seid meine Engel auf erden
In der Hölle auf erden,bis wir irgendwann sterben

Wir sind die,die jetzt als letztes lachen

In der Nacht bin ich mit Desue und seinem Escalade am Cruisen
Und am nächsten Tag gehe ich dann Engin in dem Krankenhaus besuchen
Ich sag alter ruf' mich an, Alpa ruft mich an
Holt mich ab, und wir fahren dann am Kuhdamm lang
Sein Auto fährt auf Chrom und tief
Wir drehen den Sound auf, von B-Tight und Tony D
Tony D, der deutsche Oldie B
Boxt sich im Puff, bis der Zuhälter im Koma liegt
Ich fühl' mich gut wenn ich Groupies mit Bobby ficke
B-Tight der Playboy,mit Zahnlücke und Sonnenbrille
Ich chill' mit Hengzt, was liegt an mein Freund
Standard, erst Friseur, und später dann zu Sunpoint
Ich bin mit G-hot im Club und schrei' jump jump
Tomekk kommt vorbei und wir beide halten Abstand
Ich brauch n' killer Beat, rapp' auf Paul NZA Beats
Tai Jason, Desue, oder N Joe Rilla Beat
Ich geh' zum Frauenarzt, mach Lieder mit der Basscrew
Kauf' dann mit Mr Long Sneaker bei Bass 2
Ich fahr' mit Paymal und Halil zu den Lieblingsrappern
Lauf' durch die Straße mit Bogy auch bei miesem Wetter
Ich geh' zu Aggro und seh' dann mein Homegirl
Wer ist mein Homegirl, Kaethe ist mein Homegirl
Dieses Lied ist wie ein letzter Brief
Vor dem Tod FLER rest in peace

Doch ich weiß wie es ist wenn man nichts hat, 
Das Essen bei den Nachbar riecht und selber ist man nicht satt. 
Ne' Einzimmerwohnung mit 'ner Decke die nicht dicht war,
Wasser auf dem Boden und ne' Küche die kein Licht hat. 
Ich hatte Hunger, musste Pizza bei der Tanke klauen,
Wurde dann erwischt, musste den Typ dann bei der Tanke hauen. 
Sprang übern Gartenzaun weg von der Polizei,
Konnte nicht nach Hause, musste erstmal bei meinem Homie bleiben. 
Er hat mich durchgefüttert, was für ein Durcheinander, Alle
Ich hatte kein Cent, kam mir manchmal vor wie so ein Punker. 
Ohne eine Mama die dir immer Kohle schenkt,
Kann's passieren das du beim Sozi jemanden zu Boden streckst.

Ich werde so reich das jeder Mensch im Land mich hasst.

Ich bin so froh ich zahl die Miete denn ich rapp' jetzt.

Bin nur am arbeiten, verdienen mir den Respekt wie Sido. 
Paparazzis machen Fotos von meinem Papa, krass,

Vergolde meine Platte und dann später auch die Zähne ganz.
Es macht bling wenn ich flow', es macht buh wenn du rappst, 
Applaudier' nicht bei dir, ich cruise ruf jubelnd My Yes.

Sie hat dein Essen gekocht und deine Hemden gebügelt.

Nach so vielen Jahren. Du hast sie so oft geschlagen,
Ich hab's mitbekommen. Auf dem Weg zur Schule bist du nie mitgekommn.
Du hast mich so oft belogen. Ich wollte Bugs Bunny gucken.
Du hast gesagt, ich kann's ja später mit Mami gucken.
Wegen dir hab ich die Folge verpasst, und du hast jeden Tag gesagt das du heute nich' kannst.
Warst wie ein Stiefvater, sag nich das du mich liebst Vater.
Nach der Trennung wurd' es schlimmer, du hast Mami bedroht.

Wenn dein eigener Vater nich' einmal nach dir fragt.
Ich wurde älter, kam in die achte Klasse,
Und fing dann damit an, dich verdammt zu hassen.
Mama sagte ich bin schon wie du, und ich werd' sauer,
Ich bin nicht wie du, verdammt nochmal, komm bitte jetzt nich an.
Ich würd' dich umbringen, für all die schlimmen Stunden.

Ich wollt als Kind nur zu Vater und Mama,
Doch sie verschwanden wie 'ne Vatermorgana
Ich werd als Mann ein guter Vater und Papa,
Und geh nich weg wie 'ne Vatermorgana
Zu viele Kinder sehen 'ne Vatermorgana
Denn sie leben ohne Vater und Mama.
So viele Kinder sehen ihren Vater ein paar mal,
Bis er verschwindet wie 'ne Vatermorgana

Ich werd' ein guter Vater, werd' mein Kind erziehen.
Werd ihm alles kaufen, auch wenn ich nichts verdien'.
Ich werd' ihn mehr lieben als mich selbst,
Werd' ihm mehr geben als nur Geld.
Werd' ihn streicheln, tragen und behüten,
Man wird sich streiten doch nicht schlagen und belügen.
Er wird es besser haben, auch an schlechten Tagen,
Wird ihm nichts fehlen und er wird immer was zu essen haben.
Ein großes Kinderzimmer, jeden neuen Turnschuh.
Will er ein Basketball, geb' ich ihm den Korb dazu.
Ich nehm' ihn Huckepack, es wird ein guter Tag.
Weil ich immer Zeit für ihn und seine Kumpels hab.
Wünsch' ihm 'ne gute Nacht, schenk' ihm ein Teddy Bär,
Bin sein Teddy Fler, bin sein Daddy Fler.
Ich werd' sowas wie sein bester Freund und er wird sagen:
Danke Paps, du hast mich nie enttäuscht!

Denn mein Schwanz ist so groß wie der Grill von Desue's Chrysler
Du hast Probleme, oki doki man ich regel das
Ich hab mehr Ice am Start als jeder Spast bei Häagen-Dazs
Du willst mal wissen wie das Ghetto so ist
Doch du hast Schiss, dass du dich verpisst
Bist nur ein Ghetto Tourist
Jeder Promi ist ein Fan von mir und liebt diesen Scheiß
Ich hab im V.I.P. Bereich, darum ein V.I.P. Bereich
Du Vogel

Man du bist das Letzte da hilft auch kein Imagewechsel
Du machst auf maskulin, doch es sind nur Kindertexte
Leute sagen ich hab ne Hooligangang
Denn ich trag die Fahne nicht erst seit der Fußball-WM
Ich cruise im Benz
Schieße mit Kugeln auf Fans
Sie nennen mich arrogant
Mir scheiß egal was du von mir denkst
Das ist nicht Phantasie
Man ich schieße auf die Phantasie
Ich werd zum Amokläufer, wenn ich meine Pump Gun zieh
Du bist ein Punk, du Dieb, red dich nicht raus
Ich sag die Wahrheit ins Gesicht und ich red mit der Faust
Ihr seid alle jetzt am Boden und steht nie wieder auf
Ich nenn dich Hurensohn, denn du hast meine Lieder gesaugt
Möchtegern Gangstarapper wollen Aggro jetzt dissen
Kein Problem ich puste euch weg, so wie Marlboro Kippen
Jeder rappt jetzt von Gangs und welchen Rapper er kennt
Jeder rappt jetzt im Slang, ist im Goldkettentrend
Fick deine Masche
Ich hab jetzt mehr als nur einen Schein in der Tasche
Du bist kugelsicher
Schlag dir eine rein mit der Waffe
Deine Bitch ist wie ne Tanke, sie ist offen für alles
Ich geh jede Nacht zu ihr und
Wenn wir poppen dann knallt es
Man wär ich du, würd ich sagen ich bin schlechter als Fler
Camouflage, vorwärts Marsch, Gangsta Rapmilitär
Ich bin ein Pitbull und du Homo wie Brad Pitt schwul
Du gehst auf Party und keine Bitch find dich Bitch cool
Ich hab deinen Song nie im Club gehört
Wir decken mehr Gees den Rücken als ein Gucci-Shirt
Du bist der Typ, der kein Respekt von der Straße bekommt
Du bist nicht Fler
Sag warum machst du auf hart in den Songs?
Ich bin ein schlechter Einfluss, denn ich trink mein Alk bei Viva
Meine Lieder machen mehr Stress als die Al Quaida
Ich bin ein Topterrorist
Der Boss der dich disst
Ihr seid keine Stars
Ihr seid Sternchenopfer im Biz
Ich könnte kotzen wenn ich heute deine Loser da seh
Ich dreh die Boxen auf
Und fahr im Benz am Ku'dammkarree
Dj Desue cuttet die Beats
Du kackst nur auf Beats
Ich bin ein Zuhälter und gib dir Backenfutter im Kiez
Du sagst erst: Salamaleikum
Und dann: Wo ist mein Salami Bacon?

Man, du bist alles was ich brauch'
Und ich lauf' und ich lauf',
Vielleicht nicht immer geradeaus,
Doch du bist alles was ich brauch
Und ich sauf' und ich sauf',
Und ich hör niemals damit auf.
Denn du bist alles was ich brauch
Und ich lauf und ich lauf,
Vielleicht nicht immer geradeaus,
Doch du bist alles was ich brauch
Und ich sauf' und ich sauf'
Und ich hör niemals damit auf.

Ich halt dich fest auch beim Auto fahren
Auf der Autobahn machst du jetzt dass ich fliege und ich schau dich an
Du begleitest mich, denn wir sind beide unzertrennlich
Nur du kennst mich, machst mich männlich - unsre Liebe unvergänglich
Doch ich seh', wie uns die andren hassen
Wie sie lachen, wie sie kommen und sagen dass wir nicht zueinander passen
Wie sie sagen, ich soll aufhören jetzt im Dreck zu leben,
Versuchen dich mir weg zu nehmen und mich ins Bett zu legen
Doch egal wie viel zeit mir bleibt,
Du bist mein ein und alles, wir verbring' die Zeit zu zweit
Ich bin, nur dir treu, du bist mein Sinn im Leben
Mit dir schaff ich es meinem Leben einen Sinn zu geben

Man, du bist alles was ich brauch'
Und ich lauf' und ich lauf',
Vielleicht nicht immer geradeaus,
Doch du bist alles was ich brauch
Und ich sauf' und ich sauf',
Und ich hör niemals damit auf.
Denn du bist alles was ich brauch
Und ich lauf und ich lauf,
Vielleicht nicht immer geradeaus,
Doch du bist alles was ich brauch
Und ich sauf' und ich sauf'
Und ich hör niemals damit auf.

Yeah, wenn du nicht da bist geht's mir scheiße, ich fang' an zu zittern
Hörst du das Gewitter, es ist wie ein Leben hinter Gittern
Hol mich hier raus, ohne dich krieg' ich kein Bissen runter
Fick auf das Business, ohne dich ziehen mich die Disses runter
Warum bist du nicht mehr da für mich ich Plan es nich'
Ich nehm' dich wieder in den Arm, leg Bares auf den Ladentisch
Gehen aus dem Laden und lauf mit dir jetzt die Straße hoch
Und danach 'ne Nase Koks, wieder eine Straße hoch
Wieder das Glas und Prost, wieder so ahnungslos,
Wieder das ganze Leben einfach mal im Arsch und so
Doch scheiß egal, fickt die Realität,
Es ist eh zu spät, es ist eh zu spät

Man, du bist alles was ich brauch'
Und ich lauf' und ich lauf',
Vielleicht nicht immer geradeaus,
Doch du bist alles was ich brauch
Und ich sauf' und ich sauf',
Und ich hör niemals damit auf.

Es geht mal wieder um die ewige Frage 
""Underground oder Mainstream"" und um diesen Kampf auszufechten 
Sind heute angetreten, Underground-Legende (Frank White) 
Gegen Mainstream-Rapper (Fler)
Auf in die erste Runde!

Fick dich Promi du brauchst Bodyguards wenn du auf Party bist
Neue deutsche Welle, jeder weiß, dass du ein Nazi bist
Man guck dich an du bist 'ne fette Kartoffel
Man Sonny hatte recht, du kannst gar nicht rappen du Trottel
Denn ich bin Frank White, glaub mir ich gewinne das Battle
Steh am Block mit Newszettel, fick dich du Bengel
Meine Pumpaction, ""Pump, Pump"" Fick auf dein ""Jump Jump""
Du bist ein Arschgesicht, man denkt du rappst mit Handstand

Man deine olle jumpt im Club, ich mach die Party klar
Du sagst ich bin Nazi, guck meine Bodyguard ist Araber (Hoho)
Du kannst rappen, doch bist pleite mit dei'm Untergrund
Meine Mukke pumpt im Club, du nimmst gern fürn Pfund in Mund
Und du sagst ich bin 'ne fette Kartoffel, man du bist Frank White
Kein Fan weiß, wie du halbes Hemd heißt
Ich komm mit Benz, heißt nicht mit der BVG
Warte auf den Bus Junge ich komm im BMW (Wuuhuu)
Kein Ding, Alter!

Habt ihr das mitbekommen, die Nazi-Nummer gegen Fler, 
Aber Fler’s Bodyguard ist Araber. 
Es scheint so, als müsste noch ein bisschen mehr kommen. 
Und die Zeit dafür, ist jetzt.
Hier ist die zweite Runde!

Ich mach kein Geld mit Rap, ich mach mein Geld mit Crack
Und fick auf deine Baggypants, du Opfer bist ein Nuttensohn (Opfer)
Was halbes Hemd? 100 Kilo gepushed
Ich mach alles ganz alleine, dich hat Sido gepushed (Oh ja)
Du verkaufst keine Platten ohne schlechte Skandale
Und Specter weiß jetzt dieser Rapper macht hier echte Randale
Jetzt ist Krieg die Devise, duck dich wenn ich schieße
Ich fick dich Bastard auf der Badewiese

Man du sagst bei mir wär' jetzt ohne Sido nichts passiert
Auf dei'm ersten Tape steht noch von Bushido präsentiert (Shit)
Du bist kein Gangster, Junge, guck wie du auf Gangster tust
Dass du immer Gangster rufst, ist Opfer- und nicht Gangstermove
Du hast kein Crack, du bist Story wie Sonny
Man ich mach Business in der Lobby, Rapper ficken ist Hobby (Verstehst du?)
Du bist 'ne Bitch, denn dein Shirt ist zu eng
Ich ruf' deine Ma an und nach 'nem Flirt wird gebangt (Oh Hamma)

Disst du meine Mutter, fick ich deine ganze Sippe
Deine ganzen Homies sind für mich nur eine Spasten-Clique
Fick dein Mainstream deine Zeit ist vorbei
Ich bin so geil, nicht nur Baba Saad bitet mein Style
Du bist ein arroganter Rapper wenn du Platten verkaufst
Und wenn du Platten verkaufst, weißt du ich Kacke jetzt drauf
Ich bin 'ne Untergrund-Legende, deine Kacke ist out
Das ist Carlo, Cokxxx Flavor, halt die Backen du Sau (Wow)

Du bist im Untergrund Legende, kauf dir Colakeks

Doch deine Freundin sagt, der Rapper ist so süß auf dem Cover von der Backspin
Jetzt ist Action komm seh' heut' mein Face bei TRL

Fler,"Guck' ich lebe, wie Meisten,
So gut man halt leben kann
Und ich regel' meinen Scheiß längst,
Wie ein echter Mann.
Viel zu weit um aufzugeben,
Viel zu fern von meinem Ziel.
Stets bereit um los zulegen.
Das ist mein Spiel.
Und ich weiß jetzt was es heißt,
Du bist immer nur auf dich,
Und zwar immer nur auf dich,
Ganz allein gestellt.
Das ist wie ein Teufelskreis,
Den du einfach nicht durchbrichst,
Außer Jemand schenkt dir Licht,
Das die Nacht erhellt.

Und sie sagen, dass du das für mich niemals sein wirst

Doch ich kann dich sehen,
Auch wenn meine Wut mich blind gemacht hat.
Ich kann dich hören,
Selbst wenn mich mein Hass schon taub gemacht hat.
(Du verfolgst mich)

Ich weiß genau, man.
Ohne dich ist in meinem Leben alles negativ.
Es ist egal wie viel ich fick,
Oder Champus in die Gläser fließt.
Es ist egal wie viele Lines du in deinem Leben ziehst,
Denn eines Tages merkst du,
Dass du ganz allein im Regen liegst.
Und du merkst, du willst es schaffen im Leben
Du merkst du hast einen Segen
Du hast die Kraft es zu regeln
Deswegen, mach dein Ding auch wenn sie hassen und reden
Und auch die hassen und reden, werden bald lachen und beten
Ich weiß es.
Ich kann dich sehen
Du bist die Kraft die mich leitet
Bist die Macht, die mich jede Nacht als krasses begleitet
Mit dir bin ich nicht nur dieser Rapper der rappt
Bin ein besserer Mensch
Dann der Rapper der rappt
Ich weiß genau
Dass ohne dich in meinem Leben alles anders wär
Denn du bist der der mich gemacht hat
Deshalb gibt's kein andern Fler
Mein ganzes Leben war ein Auf und Ab
Ich hab nicht drauf gekackt
Ich hab an dich geglaubt
Und hab es raus geschafft, amen
Du bist die Liebe, die Ziele
Die Perspektive bis ich sterbe
Mit der Bibel der Liebe
Und es ist scheiß egal welche Krise ich schiebe
Denn du bist da für mich
Verzeihst mir jede miese Intrige
Ich schieße
Nicht Friede ist besser viel als Kriege
Denn wir sind eines Tages bei dir
Und ich fliege und fliege
Ich gucke in den Spiegel
Weiß jetzt alles hat sein Sinn gehabt
Früher dacht' ich nur
Mein ganzes Leben und ich sind verkackt
Heute bin ich Gottes Sohn
Früher nur ein Kind der Stadt
Gangbanger schweigen
Denn sie wissen du bin King der Stadt
Wir rappen jeden Tag
Wie krass wir doch sind.
Und Bushido du weißt auch,
Man der Hass macht uns blind!

Doch ich kann dich sehen,
Auch wenn meine Wut mich blind gemacht hat.
Ich kann dich hören,
Selbst wenn mich mein Hass schon taub gemacht hat.
Doch ich Kann dich sehen
Auch wenn meine Wut mich blind gemacht hat.

Fler,"Wenn normale 16, 17-jährige Mist bauen, da geht was kaputt, 
Sie fallen in der Schule durch, beleidigen jemanden, 
Oder tauchen betrunken auf dem Abschluss auf, Dann müssen sie beim Rektor erscheinen, 
Oder ihren Autoschlüssel abgeben oder sie kriegen Hausarrest. 
Doch es gibt auch andere Kids. 
Wenn die Mist bauen, wird jemand auf dem Parkplatz erschossen. 
Und diese Kids, landen dann hier",Intro

Wir schreiben das Jahr '98,
Das wird ein schlechtes Jahr,
Noch schlechter als letztes Jahr,
Denn ich weiß, gar kein Cash ist da,
Bin's leid die selben Scheißklamotten, (Shit)
Immer nur die selben? Botten?
Immer nur die selben gelben Nikes, die verrotten, (Aha)
Bin es leid dieser Gestank von den Socken,
Bin es leid die ganze Nacht die selbe Schlampe zu poppen,
Verdammt, bin es leid, dass diese Spasten mich crossen,
Bin es leid im Knast zu hocken, denn ich hab nichts verbrochen, (Yeah)
Bin es leid, dass ich nich' viel hab, kein Ziel hab, kein Deal hab,
Bins leid, dass ich gedealt hab mit den Junkies auf dem Spielplatz,
Ich bin's leid, dass jeder Zweite mich stresst,
Doch egal ich hab ein Traum, und ich halte dran fest.

Ich bin's leid, dass ich ein Star bin, es ist 2001,

Ich bin's leid, dass Leute sagen, ich bin fett und ein Nazi,
Doch wenn ich vor ihnen steh, sind dann alle nett auf der Party, (Aha)
Ich bin's leid, dass ich die Leute Push,
Und später ist dann mit der Freundschaft Schluss,
Denn sie labern erneut nur Stuss.
Ich bin's leid, denn jeder Zweite denkt jetzt, er kann rappen,
Ich bin's leid, denn ihr könnt nur wie Stefan oder Erkan rappen.
Deine Freundin schreibt mir 10 SMS, und sie stresst,
Ich seh' jeden Tag nur DSDS, und es stresst,
Ich bin's leid, dass jeder Zweite mich stresst,
Doch egal ich hab mein Traum, und ich halte dran fest.

Bin's leid, dass sie nich' in der Lage sind, dann einfach wegzuhören,
Bins leid, dass Weiber sagen, sie sind keine Schlampe, (Aha)
Doch nach ein mal Tanzen lutscht sie dann mein Schwanz und sagt dann drei mal danke.
Ich bin's leid, dass die meisten Deutschen Opfer sind,
Dass ich rappe, und sie lieber hören, wie irgendein Rockstar singt. (Shit)
Ich bin's leid, dass du denkst, du wärst was Besseres,
Bins leid, dass du ne große Fresse hast, als wärst du Schwester S. (Shit)
Mann, ich bin's leid, dass sie dissen, weil sie neidisch sind,
Ich bin's leid, jeden zu dissen und die Scheiße stimmt,
Ich bin's leid, dass jeder Zweite mich stresst, (Yeah)

Du warst für deine Brüder sowas, wie ein Held, ein Führer
Du warst ein Ghettostar, du warst da für die Jugend
Wenn sie Probleme hatten, dann war klar, wen sie rufen
Warst der HipHop-Messias, mit den Kids auf dem Spielplatz
Hast uns erklärt, du bist HipHop, auch wenn du nicht viel hast
Es ging nicht um die Kohle, egal mit oder ohne
Du warst zur Stelle, meintest mit der Dose nicht Pistole
Hast Geschichte geschrieben, dein Gesicht war zufrieden
Hast geschlichtet zwischen ihnen, dass sie sich nicht bekriegen
Wenn du im Ghetto warst, dann waren die Kinder froh
Doch dann bist du von uns gegangen, sag warum ist das so?

Man sagt, „Die Guten sterben früh"", sag warum ist das so?
Du warst zu gut für diese Welt, sag warum bist du so?
Ich weiß, jetzt geht's dir besser, man ich weiß, jetzt bist du froh
Ich zünd 'ne Kerze für dich an und sie scheint lichterloh.

Du warst 'ne gute Seele, hattest viel Mut und Ehre
Die ganze Szene wusste, HipHop fließt durch deine Vene
Du hattest viele Pläne, HipHop war die Religion
Du wolltest keine Million, du hattest nur eine Vision
Wolltest HipHop verbreiten, wolltest bessere Zeiten
Du warst der Grund, dass sie nicht fighten, wenn die Gangster sich streiten
Ich kannte dein' Namen schon von Spaiche und Specter
Von Halil, sie haben viel erzählt und es war gleich Respekt da
Ich hat' die große Ehre, mit Dir vor der Kamera
Du warst wie ein Kamerad, mehr als das, du warst ein Star

Du schaust auf unsere Stadt, du schaust auf uns herab
Und jeder deiner Freunde weiß, dass er da oben einen Kumpel hat
Wir ham' viel durchgemacht, doch es hat uns verbunden
Wir drehen wieder unsre Runden, langsam heilen unsre Wunden
Das ist die Wirklichkeit, Bezirke sind vereint

Ich packte es nicht mich irgendwo unterzuordnen
Die Gesellschaft bespuckte mich Gangster taten mich supporten
Roland gab mir 'ne Wage verscheckte Wahre fürs Bare
Mitte der 90er Jahre hat ich meine besten Tage
Mein Pickelgesicht strahlte sah ich meine Züge fahren
Ich liebte Rap und beweg' mich schon seid den späten 80ern
Osama gab mir den Namen den ich heute noch habe
Er sagt der passt zu mir gut weil ich diesen Groove in mir habe
Ich lebte auf der Straße denn Zuhause war nur Stress
Atze ich klaute und raubte doch wurde nie dabei gecasht
Ich scheißte auf die Schule und ging steif zur Schule
Der scheiß' Direktor meinte Moritz is' ein böser Bube
Meine Hure wurde schwanger doch sie trieb ab
Ich war in sie nie verliebt doch das Kind hät' ich gern gehabt
Jeden Job hab ich verkackt Rap und Dope brachten mir Zastern

Ich nahm den Stab aus der Kiste und machte Mu zu 'ner Witwe
Egal wer mich disste ich malte es mit schwarz auf die Liste
War jeden Tag auf der Piste, weil kein Arsch mich vermisste
Chillte jeden Tag bei Downstairs dann is' Maxim gestorben
Ab dann war alles depressiv ich trank mein Becks schon am Morgen
Sagte nicht bitte nicht danke klaute mein Shit an der Tanke
Fickte ohne Gummi rum und jede Bitch war 'ne Schlampe
Musste zum Amt und zum Soz rappe aus Fun über Koks
Und wurde dann langsam groß wurde bekannt für die Flows

Ich schau zurück, ich seh' den kleinen Jungen am Block
Er macht nur Stunk und Zoff. Hat sich nur rumgeboxt.
Sie sagen, Deutschland hat kein Ghetto.
Er hat es in seinem Kopf
Niemand hat an ihn geglaubt.
Doch er weiß, er schafft es doch.
Schaut mich heute an. Kinder wie die Zeit vergeht.
Aus dem nichts etwas machen ist ein weiter Weg.
Und ich hab so hart dafür gekämpft.
Ein kleines Kind aus einer großen Stadt, das nicht mal seinen Vater kennt.
Kein Zuhause, kein Essen, keine Perspektive
Keine Familie, kein Geld, keine Liebe.
Wer hät's gedacht, der dicke Spast aus dem Heim
Wird vom besten Label der Welt, von Aggro gesigned.
Das war, Carlo Cokxxx Nutten. Cordon Sport Massenmord.
Das war ein Mann ein Wort. Bruder. Ein Mann ein Mord.
Das war: Wir sind Best und der Rest wird gebumst.
Ich komm auf die Party und mach Stress ohne Grund.
Ihr habt mich unterschätzt, nicht an mich geglaubt. So sieht's aus.
Asche zu Asche und Staub zu Staub.
Ich hab ausgeteilt. Ich hab eingesteckt.
Doch egal was passiert. Das hier nimmt mir keiner Weg

Das ist Willkommen in Berlin. Eine Bombe und du liegst

Ein böser Engel auf der Street, also renn' besser!
Papa ist zurück, man ich fick dein Fame
Ihr könnt uns nichts mehr nehmen.
Guck wir bleiben stehen!
Was ist Beef?
Im Endeffekt gar nichts!
Das ist Gangsterpolitik. Fick dich, bezahl' mich!
Ein deutscher Badboy zerdrückt das Game in seiner Hand
Du fragst , warum bist du so? Ich bin fremd im eigenen Land.
Das ist Maskulin, Geerap auf deutsch
Denn ich bleib wie ich bin, auch wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft.
Sie hassen dich. Doch trotzdem wollen sie sein wie du.
Sie lieben dich. Doch irgendwie gibt es keiner zu.
Frag jetzt was früher war, die ganze alte Scheiße.
Mein Name ist in meiner Street im Asphalt eingemeißelt.
Dieser Track ist als ob die Zeit stehen bleibt.

Verstehst du?
Yeah, Beatzarre!

Aus meiner Perspektive seid ihr Rapper arschgefickte Toys
Gebt mir Zwanzigtausend für ein Feature, ich mach nichts mit euch
Warum ist die Industrie so gefickt?
Warum hatet mich das Game? Warum liebt es mich nicht?
Weil ihr Schlampen seid, guck ich seh' die Bitch in dir
Man ihr braucht mich, weil ohne mich hier nichts passiert
Ihr seid nur Medien die auf wichtig tun
Labels die auf wichtig tun
Rapper die auf wichtig tun
Lutscht meinen Schwanz!
Mein Erfolg basiert auf Straßenslang, Maskulin-Style
Du bist jetzt 'ne Boygroup, weil ich Rapper vierteile
Du weißt es, du bist nur ein Technoproduzent
Du Krawatte, ich den Hoody, wer ist Ghetto so wie Frank White
Scheiß auf deinen Live-Gig, scheiß auf deinen Konfettirap
Gestern warst du Mittestyle, heute wieder Baggypants
Scheiß auf deinen Emoshit, egal wie voll ok du bist
Ihr Punker seid nur Bonzenkinder, bitte Junge rede nicht

Du bist kein schlechter Rapper, du bist charakterschwach
Du bist kein krasser Künstler, du bist ein krasser Spast
Guck nicht meine Tattoos an, denn ich bin Ghetto man
In Südberlin mag keiner euren pseudoschlauen Electrokram
Du Schlampe geh und mach dir Frenchnails für Frank
Ich stehe auf Tussis, nicht auf Ökoschlampen Gang, G, G, Gangbang
Du bist schockiert, ich weiß, trink ruhig deinen Fencheltee
Neffi macht den Vorschuss klar, ich sitze im BMW
Und schieb' 'nen Colonel, ihr seid alle neidisch auf mich
Denn ich bin Gangster, ich bin sexy und ich scheiße auf dich
Ich fahre die Prollschiene, du bist nur ein netter Student
Man es gibt viele Rapper, doch es gibt nur einen wie Frank
Nur einen wie Frank, verstehst du? Komm schon, Baby, tanz' vor mir
Deutsche Rapper sind nur Pussies und haben alle Angst vor mir

Ich bin doch nicht blind, ich seh' genau.
Du verschwindest im Wind mit 'ner' andern Frau.
Drehst dich nicht mehr um.
Alles bleibt stumm.

Ich sing nicht mehr für Dich
Siehst du den Schmerz in meinem Gesicht
Jedes Lied erinnert mich an Dich
Ich will Dich vergessen so hart wie's ist
Ich sing nicht mehr für Dich. Oh oh oh yeah
Auch wenn Du wieder kämst
Du kriegst kein Liedchen mehr

Mein Mädchen ich schreib dir diesen Brief, ich hoff' du liest ihn auch.
Tut mir leid wie's jetzt gekommen ist, ich musste einfach raus.
Das Leben ist schon komisch gerade wenn man erst mal glaubt,
Besser kann's nicht laufen dann zerfällt alles zu Staub.
Wir waren das Überteam, auf den Straßen Südberlins.
Und egal was ich für scheiße baute, du hast mir verziehen.
Ich weiß wir haben uns geschworen niemals kleinbeizugeben.
Doch jetzt stehst du meinetwegen, da allein und weinst im Regen.
Alles ist Trauer, ich denk' nur an die Zeit mit dir.
Reiß dein Foto von der Wand doch du bleibst ein Teil von mir.
Danke das du nicht so blind bist wie ich.
Ich hoffe du vergisst mich

Doch ich schreib dir jetzt diese Zeilen, 
Auch wenn ich weiß das du mich hasst.
Mein Schatz du musst mir glauben, du warst mein Lebenslicht.
Doch ich kann nicht aus meiner Haut.
Baby manchmal geht es nicht.
Ich glaub das ganze Glück mit uns war zu viel für mich.
Sag nicht's bitte, ich find' mich selber manchmal widerlich.
Es klingt bescheuert, doch ich weiß du wirst mich verstehen.
Alles kommt anders als man denkt, bitte lass mich gehen.
Ich denk an deine Stimme sie klingt so wie tausend Engel.
Da wo ich jetzt bin mal ich deinen Namen auf die grauen Wände.
Danke das du nicht so blind bist wie ich.
Ich hoffe du vergisst mich
Ich hoff' du vergisst mich nicht.

Ein kleiner Junge in der großen Stadt,
Träumt das er's auf jeden Fall nach oben schafft.

Wie mein Vater mir den Rücken kehrte,
Doch ich schwor mir das ich glücklich werde.
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Hand in Hand durch Süd-Berlin.
Ich ging ihr dauernd fremd
Doch sie hat mir verziehen.
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Wie sie kamen um mich ins Heim zu holen,
Jugendknast, betreutes Einzelwohnen
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Wie die Mauer fiel um Berlin.
Meine Stadt war wieder eins,
Ich war sieben.
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Die kalten Wände in der Psychiatrie,
Doch ich hab es geschafft, irgendwie.
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Wie ich plötzlich meine Lehre schmiss
Bomt die ganze Stadt mit meinem Stift.
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Ihr habt mich alle früher unterschätzt,
Doch ich habe gekämpft bis zuletzt, guck mal jetzt.

Die neue deutsche Welle rollte über's Land.

Nach Carlo Cokxxx die ganzen Kinderfaxen,
Bruder später können wir sicher drüber lachen.

Wie jeder sagte, das ich Nazi sei,
Bloß weil Fler als einziger die Fahne zeigt.
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Der ganze Stress in West-Berlin.
Mighty Maxim, Homie Rest in Peace.
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Bei MTV die Messerstecherei,
Mir ist nichts passiert,
Denn Marwan war dabei.
(Ich werde nie vergessen)
Woher ich komm, wo ich jetzt bin.
Endlich macht die ganze Scheiße einen Sinn.

Gefällt es dir? Und wenn nicht, guck mal hier:
Mittelfinger in dein Face, warum Fler? Das bin ich.
Darum heißt das Album so, denn es dreht sich nur um mich.
Um die Street, um den Stress.
Wer ist hier? Wer ist Chef?
Im Gebiet, was ist jetzt?
Sag wer flext, außer Frank.
Und meine Gang, meine Jungs,
Man es geht nur um uns.
Um die Welt, um uns drum,

Du bist nichts wenn du weiß bist,
Ein Stich wenn du weiß bist.
Sunpoint mit der Gang in dein Gesicht, wenn du weiß bist.
Die Leute reden Junge, ich bin dies, ich bin das.
Ich sag euch was ich nicht bin, also Leute aufgepasst

Ich bin nicht, massentauglich, hinterhältig, abgefuckt,
Ich red' nicht hinterm Rücken, ich bin straight und du kackst ab du Spasst.
Ich bin nicht unterwegs mit 20 Brüdern die dich ficken,
Weil ich mich allein nicht trau, was ich rap' ist nicht so beschissen billig.
Ich bin nicht nett zu Bravo, Backspin, Juice,
Damit die mich aufs Cover packen, jeder andere Rapper tut's.
Ich bin nicht türkisch, nicht arabisch, bin nicht arisch.
Ich bin nicht Nazi, nicht politisch, nicht fanatisch.
Ich bin nicht Heute so und morgen so, ich rap' present.
Ich bin nicht arrogant, ein Wichser, bin kein schlechter Mensch.

Erschieß' mich oder lass es.

Was ich tu? Ich leb' das Leben eines Rappers, und wenn das nicht mehr klappt, 
Dann werd ich Dealer und vercheck' was! 
Erzähl mir nicht von all dem Ärger Mann ich kenn' das!
Stress mit der Familie, mit den Freunden und den Gangstern! 
Man du musst biten! Schaff es und du bist der Champ! 
Das Leben ist ein harter Kampf, du bist hier nicht im Disneyland! 
Und wenn du's schaffst dann weist du, dass dich jeder Wichser kennt 
Und jeder Wichser denkt er ist dann auch wie Frank ein Buissnessman! 
Doch bleib bescheiden lässig und entspannt!

In mein Haus ich weiß nicht woran das liegt
In mein Haus mein Haus

Sie ham' mich wieder eingeliefert es war ein Befehl
Die da oben sagten das ich jetzt zu krass am Zeiger dreh'
Ich weiß sie wollen mich boykottieren mir den Mund verbieten
Mich runter ziehen doch ich lass mich nicht unterkriegen
Sie wollen mich ausradieren mein willen brechen
Mich wieder in die Klapse stecken und auf Pillen setzten
Weil ich die Wahrheit sage diese Welt ist krank 
Ich war immer Thema Nummer eins auf jeden Elternabend
Sie wollen die Scheiße aus mir rausprügeln denn die Jugend geht kaputt 
Und ja einer muss es ausbügeln
Sie geben mir tausend Pillen wollen das ich die Scheiße schluck' 
Doch ich spuck' es alles wieder wenn mal wieder keiner guckt
Ich kann nicht schlafen 
Junge ich hab Schweiß-Attacken 
Ich weiß sie kommen jede Nacht in ihren weißen Jacken
Doch egal was sie versuchen ich halt es aus diese Hölle hier ist mein Haus

In mein Haus ich weiß nicht woran das liegt

In meinem Haus seh' ich wie Patienten kippen rauchen
Wie gebrochene existenten durch die Gitter schauen
Sie geben dir Medizin sagen sie macht glücklich
Manchmal denkt man selber schon das man verrückt ist
Ich bin hier eingesperrt mehr Pillen als normales essen
Voll auf Antidepressiva täglich an mein Bett gefesselt
Ich hab' vergessen wie lang ich schon hier unten sitz'
Ob es draußen jetzt noch hell oder schon dunkel is
Sie wollen mein Leben zerficken doch 
Ich bleibe hart scheißegal wie viel Strom sie jetzt durch meinen Schädel jagen
Sie sagen dir das du der Abschaum der Menschheit bist 
Ich schlag' den Kopf durch die wand doch es ändert nichts
Ich ritze diese Zeilen mit Fingern in die Wand 
Ihr könnt mir alles nehm' doch nie bekommt ihr mein verstand
Egal was sie versuchen ich halt es aus in dieser Hölle in meinem Haus

Is' mein Haus wo sie sagen ich bin ein Freak
In mein Haus ich weiß nicht woran das liegt
In mein Haus mein Haus

Sie ham' mich wieder rausgelasen an das Tageslicht
Ich hab vergessen welches Jahr welcher Tag heut' is'
Ich hab für euch gekämpft bis ans Ende 
Den blauen Himmel eingetauscht gegen weiße Wände
Ich blieb' mir immer treu scheißegal was sie versuchten 
Elektroschocks Gummizelle oder kalte Duschen
Sie sagten ich bin ein Psychopath schizophren doch ich hab es ausgehalten 
Sie konnten es nie verstehen
Jetzt bin ich wieder frei und seh' wie die Sonne blitzt 
Sie gaben mir die Schuld, dass die Jugend so verkommen is'
Schau dir die Menschheit an, alles nur noch grau und flach 
Ich bin nicht so die Gesellschaft hat uns so gemacht
Ich geh jetzt raus sag wie krank das System is' 
Ich muss es machen, weil es sonst bald zu spät is' sie ham' versucht mich zu ficken 
Doch ich hielt es aus

Guck dich nur an, so behindert bist du
Wie behindert bist du? Du behinderst mich nur
Denk was du willst, Alles Fassade
Am Ende des Tages geht es nur um die Gage
Das was ich bin, das was ich habe
Verbieg dich du Hund, doch ich bleib immer gerade
Du weißt ab jetzt, für Gefühle hat man keine Zeit
Jeder lässt sich ficken doch ich mach niemals die Beine breit

Unterricht voll der Dreck, Schulhefte voll getagt.
Wenn man eh nichts wissen will, wozu soll man nachsitzen,
Für mich war Sport vor den Bullen durch den Park flitzen.
Und statt Hausaufgaben hingen wir im Kaufhaus abends,
Zwei Paar Airmax unterm Arm, zack rannten aus dem Laden.
Das falsche Outfit dann und du wurdest ausgelacht,
Ok du bist cool aber du, du bist auch ein Spast.
Und meine Lehrer dachten der kommt eh in Jugendknast,

Wenn du immer Hunger hast, klauen musst jeden Tag.
Ich war nicht brav, ich hab den harten markiert,
Doch ich hab Straßenabitur, ich hab die Straße studiert.

Die Schritte verhallen im dunkel der Nacht
Ich bin da wo ich dich das erste mal sah
Bin nicht gern hier doch hier bin ich dir nah
Wir beide sind nicht aus der selben Welt
Du erscheinst nur wenn der Vorhang fällt
Du bist so nah und doch so fern

Du gehst mir nicht mehr aus dem Sinn
Deine Augen verfolgen mich überall hin
Ich will nur das der Tag vergeht
Dein Atem ist heiß doch dein Blick ist wie Eis
Und niemals wirst du mir gehören, Engel der Nacht

Ich warte den Tag ab und zähle die Stunden,
Hier unten ich laufe, ich laufe im Dunkeln
Ich weiß nicht was soll nur was soll nur aus mir werden 
Doch du bist mein Engel in der Hölle hier auf Erden
Ich such' dich,ich ruf' dich,
Ich find' dich nicht,verfluch' dich,
Ich lieb' dich, ich frag' mich
Liebst du mich?
Sie tut's nicht die Zweifel sie plagen mich,
Du strahlst wie Flutlicht du klaust mir mein Herz und deswegen verblut' ich, 
Du treibst mich in den Wahnsinn
Überall ist dein Gesicht
Ich will dich vergessen
Doch ich schaff es einfach nicht
Die Haare, die Augen, deine Art so wie du lachst
Man glaub es mir bitte jetzt
Du bist wie für mich gemacht
Ich sende dir Signale und warte auf ein Zeichen,
Und warte auf ein Zeichen, und warte auf ein Zeichen
Ich frag mich wann hab ich es endlich geschafft 
Doch du bleibst für immer mein Engel der Nacht

Und wieder zieht es mich zu dir
Ich kann aber will es nicht kapieren
Ich setze zu hoch und kann doch noch verlieren

Du gehst mir nicht mehr aus dem Sinn
Deine Augen verfolgen mich überall hin

Boxe mich und schieß' auch,
Doch schau mal genauer hin sieht der Typ nicht lieb aus?
Das ist die Wahrheit,
Die Wahrheit man das bin ich,
Alles nur Verarsche alles nur fürs Image,
Ich war nie im Ghetto,
Ich war nie ein Gangster,
Mama sitzt Zuhause,
Papa ist ein Banker,
Opa ist ein Bonze darum auch die Villa,

Ich bin ein scheiß Prolet,
Der dir den Hals umdreht,
Weil's in der Zeitung steht,
Doch eigentlich bin ich gar nicht so

Meine Jugend war hart,
Denn ich war auf dem Internat,
Und es tat weh wenn es mal einen auf dem Hintern gab,
Ich hab mich raus geschlichen,
Nein ich war nicht immer brav,
Doch ich hab nachgedacht wenn ich auf meinen Zimmer saß,
Abitur fand ich so was von einfach,
Partys im Golfclub von Montag bis Freitag,
Und meine Freundin,
Die schönste auf dem Abi Ball,
Ich war verknallt,
Denn ihr Papi gehört Vattenfall,
Picknick im Park,
Bling Bling und Koks,
Aber nur dezent,
Ching Ching und Prost,
Und heute gehöre ich zur Creme de La Creme,
Wie das ist,
Wirst du nie im Leben verstehen,

Paris, London und dann wieder zurück,
Und ich liebe meine Frau,

Ich bin kein Nazi so'n Quatsch,
Ich spreche fast den Sprachen
Bete am Sonntag und mähe dann den Rasen,
Im Garten wie schön,
Die Kinder guck sie spielen hier,
Was wir sind?
Eine Bilderbuchfamilie,
So bin ich,
So ist es,
So und nicht anders,

Bei uns wird einer kaum noch alt.
Also kämpf' dich durch, überlebe.

Mach keine Fehler, denn nur selten wird einem verziehn'.
Hier kannst du nicht nach Hoffnung fragen
Keiner kennt sie, glaub mir.
Und wenn ich nichts habe, geh ich raus und klau, Raubtier (Ah)

Sein wie der Rest.
Hatte Probleme in der Schule,
Ärger mit dem Gesetz.
War nie der Coole, von der Schule,
Ich war nicht drin in eurem Freundeskreis,
Ich war einsam als Kind.
Dann kam die Teenagerzeit in Berlin
Da gab es G's, Breaker
Ich war einer von ihnen
Ich hatte nichts, außer eins die Hoffnung.
Und darum hing ich jede Nacht am Block, am Block rum
Und eins hab ich gelernt, wer suchet, der findet
Und 10 Jahre später, der Coolste im Business!

(Bitte halt mich fest!)

Damit ich endlich wieder schlafen kann.
Ja, das Leben war nie gut zu mir,
Doch du warst gut zu mir.
Es reicht nicht wenn ich sag,
""Du hast was gut bei mir.""
Ich schulde dir fast alles,
Fast alles was ich hab.

Fler,"Ich hab so viel geweint,
Die Narben im Gesicht.
Guck die Tränen, man ich wisch sie einfach weg.
Man dieses Leben war 'ne Lüge, keiner wusste wie ich heiße.

Ich bin nicht mehr der Typ, den ihr von damals kennt.
Ihr habt mich immer klein gehalten, heut' wird mir der Arsch geleckt.
Doch weißt du was?
Ich nehm' es dir nicht übel.
Du glaubst du bist der Man, dein Leben ist 'ne Lüge.
Deine Bitch schaut mich an und sagt, wow.
Denn ich mach mein Ding und was du kannst, kann ich auch.

Mein erster Track auf Bushidos King of Kingz Tape.
Ich meinte ich will Rapper werden. Mama nur
Du spinnst ey! 
2001, komm check meine Story. 
Es war mein Ding Trains zu bomben, ich takkte mit Sony. 
Ich hatte Panikattaken, kein Plan für die Zukunft. 
Doch eines Tages schlug die Angst und meine Panik in Wut um. 
Ich nahm das Mic, wollte rappen, wollte die Rapper zerfetzen. 
Bushido gab mir eine Chance und danach was zu Essen.
Man wir waren Aggro 4 Life.
Man AggroBerliner.
Ich musste mich entscheiden.
Maler, Rapper, was ist dir lieber? 
Ich war von Herzen ein Rapper und kein Maler-Lackierer. 
Ich hatte nichts 
Nur ein paar meiner Lieder.
Doch ich ging mit auf die Tour. 
Mit Bushido, mit Sido, mit B-Tight unterwegs, 
Ich nahm um 7 Uhr das Mikro.
Das ganze Land war geflasht, weil jeder Schläge bekam, vom Label Nr. 1, yeah.
Die Karriere begann.

Ich wünsche mir zu Weihnachten, hoffentlich ist Papi tot
Und meine Mutter, ich hoffe sie ist stark genug
Und leidet eine Weile
Der Track hier ist mein Tagebuch
Ich schreib es auf, ich hab keine Mutter mehr
Doch in der Bibel steht, man soll Vater und auch Mutter ehren
Ich sag danke, danke für das Retalin
Später dann das Taxilan
Danke für die Medizin
Danke Mama, ich sag's dir ins Gesicht
27 Jahre man, ich danke dir für nichts
Denn du hast nie an mich geglaubt, mich niemals aufgebaut
Ich hab dir nie was anvertraut, niemals zu dir aufgeschaut
Ich denke nach und merk' wie es mich runterzieht
Wenn du nicht weißt, nicht weißt, ob dich die Mutter liebt
Du denkst an dich und ich bin dir scheiß egal
Gefahr für die Gesellschaft? Ich hatte keine Wahl!

Ich bin wie ein Teufel, ich weiß du bist nicht stolz auf mich

Schwer erziehbar, doch ich bin so wie ich bin
Ich bleib, schwer erziehbar
Mama, warum ist dein Herz aus Stein?
Warum schickst du mich ins Heim?
Bitte lass mich nicht allein.

Ich bin krank, warum?
Du hast mich krank gemacht
Und wenn ich nachts geträumt hab
Dann immer nur von Angst und Hass
Was du getan hast? Du hast nur an dich gedacht.
Für andere Typen schick gemacht
Doch für mich hast du nichts gemacht
Ein paar Geschenke, doch Liebe geben kannst du nicht
Erzähl mir nichts von
Bitte Patrick ich hab solche angst um dich
Weißt du noch damals? Verdammt du hast mich angezeigt.
Dein eigenes Fleisch und Blut war obdachlos die ganze Zeit
Ab ins Heim
Du sagst du bist nicht stark genug für Kinder und Familie
Du lügst mit jedem Atemzug
Jeden Tag von der Schule ein Brief
Ihr Sohn ist blau, passt nicht auf und ist hyperaktiv
Verdammt, du hast mich abgeschoben
Patrick ist zu unbequem
Draußen in der Kälte musste ich allein im Dunkeln stehen
Du bist weg, doch das Ghetto ist blood
Und ich bleib wie ich bin, Der Rapper Frank White.

Schon damals war mein Vorbild die Gang und nicht mein Vater
Man ihr könnt mich nicht verbiegen, ihr könnt mir nichts verbieten

Und ich trag' meine Airmax, stehe auf dem Beton
Und glaub' an was ich tuhe und verliere nie die Hoffnung
Und ich scheiß' drauf, ob es weh tut, ich weine nicht, wenn es weh tut
Ich trage es mit würde, Junge Life ist live

Die Welt geht vor die Hunde, sag wo soll das enden?
Keiner von euch sieht die Wahrheit, warum? Weil ihr am Arsch seid
Ich kacke auf's Gesetz, ich bleib' Frank zum White
Und ihr habt nie an mich geglaubt, doch pass auf, ich scheiß drauf
Und heute hörst du auf der Straße nur meinen Sound

Jetzt steh' ich hier und du, stehst da unten und schaust mir zu
Damals hast du noch gelacht, trotzdem hab' ich drauf gedacht
Wer hätte, wer hätte das gedacht

Jetzt steh' ich hier und du, stehst da unten und schaust mir zu
Damals hast du noch gelacht, trotzdem hab' ich drauf gedacht
Wer hätte, wer hätte das gedacht

Damals wollt ich mit dir reden, ich hatte keine Chance
Denn du warst was besonderes und ich nur aus der Gosse
Du warst alles was ich wollte, doch ich war nur ein Heimkind
Und deshalb hat mich jeder von euch ausgelacht
Und jetzt kennst du mich von damals, du Schlampe geh beiseite
Jetzt sitze ich im 7er BMW und du in der Scheiße
Ich hoff' du bist jetzt glücklich, da unten in der U-Bahn
Und klingelst du bei mir, ruf' ich bei der Polizei
Und es treibt dich in den Wahnsinn, jetzt sagst du, du verstehst mich
Doch wenn ich sag, red' nicht, wirst du nur hysterisch
Denn ich hab mich nicht verändert, bin immer noch der selbe
Ich hab es dir gesagt, ich bleibe Frank zum White

Denn das ist die Street und nicht Beverly Hills,
Was ich hier leb', das hast du nie erlebt,
Darum denk nicht, wir beide sind irgendwie gleich,
Guck hier ist nichts wirklich so, wie es scheint,
Selten gelacht, aber zu viel geweint.

Leb' wie ich leb', und du merkst, das die Straße ohne Skrupel ist,
Aus dem Block, wo ein Drogendealer Vorbild für die Jugend ist,
Fick drauf, zurückkomm', jede Rechnung zu begleichen,
Rapper kriegen Lampemfieber, Farid Bang, Oli Geissen,
Panik bricht aus, ich scheiß' auf, jeden Spinner der meint auf,
Gangster zu tun, er wird eingetütet, so wie mein Einkauf,
Hörst du das, mein Lauf, sag den Opfern, ich bin zurück,
Alles was ich brauch ist gute Promo und ein bisschen Glück,
Täglich auf der Straße, nur am Geld-Scheffeln,
Südberlin, Cashpoint, alle Macht den Geldwetten,
Großer Nigga, arrogant, dadurch nur im Fadenkreuz,
Fick dein Vater, Hurensohn, das hier nennt man Straßendeutsch,
Das ist Mel Gibson, Payback,
Komm in meine Gegend und ich zeig dir wie man Aids streckt,
Wir sind gute Jungs, doch Maskulin die Gang,
Und wenn ich dir den Kopf eintrete, war's mein Temperament.

Ich komm in einem schneeweißen Anzug, hier von Flughafen Frankfurt,
Und die Jeeneys sind am kreischen, guck die Bitch will mein Handtuch,
Bin ein Star, bin ein Promi, ein Held für die Jugend,
Will ne Villa mit 'nem Garten, gib mir Geld oder Huren,
Doch der coolste hier zu sein man, nicht grad' einfach, man ich weiß,
Das harte Arbeit,ich wollt keiner sein, der einen auf Frank White macht,
Ich wollt mein Stil verwirklichen, das zählt zu mein Bedürfnissen,
Und mein Sound hören Deutsche, die arabisch und die türkischen,
Kids die grad' am Schulhof chillen, Straßengangs in deutschen Straßen,
Ich will nur 'ne Frau wie Megan Fox und einen teuren Wagen,
Heute fragen mich die Kids hier, werd' ich cool wie du Kay,
Ich hab keinen Plan, ich bin halt der deutsche LL Cool Jay,
Saufen, Disco, Party, Frauen, mein Motto ist mein Motto,
B-B-Badboard, ich brech dir jetzt die Knochen, du Pinocchio,
Also halt die Schnautze Shut the Fuck up, hol' dir jetzt dein Uppercut ab,
Und ich grüß' jetzt alle meine Abu-Chakers, (Abu Chakers).

Egal wie oft es schief geht, ich schaue in den Spiegel,
Und der Typ, den ich da sehe sagt zu mir ich hab es drauf,
Es ist Finster in der Nacht, stehen die Feinde an der Ecke,
Dann scheiß ich mir nicht ein, verdammt ich gehe raus,
Ich hab viel erlebt, gutes und auch schlechtes,
Doch ich heul' nicht rum, ich geb' einfach nur mein Bestes,
Brennpunkt Berlin, ich zeig dir, wo es langgeht,
Die schikimiki Schlampen, ich zeig' dir wo es abgeht,
Die Stadt die niemals schläft, Einkaufspassagen,
Ich steige aus dem Wagen, mit Nikes aus dem Wagen,
Die Polizei ist hier, die Polizei ist da,
Und wenn uns einer fragt, wir scheißen auf den Staat,
Wer mich sucht, der kann mich finden, es steht da auf dem Flyer,
Und das worauf ich stehe, sind arrogante Weiber,
Reason gibt den Jacki-Cola, jetzt ist Payback,
Junge ich mach Geld, weil ich nicht wie Jan Delay rap,
Haha, gute Jungs komm in den Himmel, doch nicht eg,
J, böse Jungs komm in das Viertel,
Mit den Airmax auf Beton, Mit den Airmax auf Zement,
Mit den Airmax, Junge es ist Frank.

Die Wolken sind grau und das Bild meiner Gegend ist hässlich
Die Angst in den Köpfen macht Menschen zu Bestien und Zombies
Das Leid auf der Straße unendlich, unendliche Stories
Ich seh diese Kids in der Gegend, sie wissen nicht weiter
Die Eltern weg und jeder fragt warum sind wir gescheitert
Es liegt auf der Hand jeder siehts der nicht blind oder taub ist
Berlin ist verdammt, kuck der Kiez alle Kinder sind traurig
Du sieht die Gangster auf der Straße, dahinter das Blaulicht

Ich kenn' mich noch immer nicht am Geldautomaten aus
Denn schon als kleiner Junge hab' ich Geld immer nur bar gebraucht
Atme ein, atme aus, parke ein, parke aus
Der Wagen ist geklaut, der Beat pumpt, Straßensound
Um uns herum keiner der sich nicht verkaufen würde
Sie verkaufen Ehre, sie verkaufen Würde
Manche wollen hier aus dem Viertel, andere bauen ein Haus im Viertel

Ich hol' meine Gage ab, bringe sie dem Rechtsanwalt
Man sitzt täglich vor dem Richter, wenn man solche Texte schreibt
Ficke die Bullen ,das Gesetz, starte durch geh aus dem Weg
Keiner hält den Deutschen auf, weil mein Sound jeden bewegt
Im Ghetto so wie Telecafe und das ein Leben lang
Ich schaff' das in einem Satz was deine ganze Szene kann
Und mich guckt jeder an, als käme ich vom andern Stern
Und darum tue ich manchmal so, als wenn ich jemand anderes wär'

Ich bin zurück nach eigenen Regeln das is' Straßenjagong
Ich kann's mir leisten lass mich verwöhnen im Massagesalon

Wir passen ins Klischee mein Freund, so sehen Kriminelle aus
Schwarzer BMW mein Freund, der Bulle hält die Kelle raus
Schreibt die Personalien auf
Für Kokain, Frauen und Zocken Junge, dafür geht die Gage drauf

24/7 auf der Straße wie ein Reifen
Schlagen oder streiten waren normal für mich als Heimkind
Wir waren noch zu klein um die Lage zu begreifen
Zwischen arm oder reich machten wir keine Unterschiede
Ich war die Jahre nicht allein es war für uns Familie
Ich hab' mich schnell daran gewöhnt, dass ich nichts besseres bin
Mama sagte wenn du gehst wirst du ein besseres Kind
Ich hab' die Luft angehalten und bin eingetaucht
Der Weg zum nächsten Atemzug hat seine Zeit gebraucht
Wir haben gelernt, früher ließen uns Gefühle kalt
Wenn wir es hier schaffen, schaffen wir es überall

Trotz der Niederlage stehst du wie ein Mann
Wie man Kohle macht haben wir schon als Kinder gewusst
Wenn du cool sein wolltest saßt du hinter im Bus
Wir haben immer nur gehofft, dass wir eines Tages sorgenfrei sind
Doch dafür muss man heut' schon wissen wo man morgen sein wird
Ich war nicht mehr da, gemerkt hat das niemand
Hab gesagt ich komm' zurück, aber kehrte nicht wieder
Dieser Schmerz ich wär' lieber jetzt zu Hause
Alles was ich hab' ist mein Herz, meine Liebe und mein Glaube

Die Schießerei
Die Stechereien
Die Klapse
Die verdammten Pillen
Wollte das Gesetzt brechen
Einfach so aus Frustration
Wurde dann festgenommen
Einsam an der Busstation
Ich hab soviel getan
Worauf ich heut' nicht stolz bin
Es war das schnelle Geld
Von dem wir alle träumten
Heut' lauf ich ins Studio rein
Nehme ein paar Texte auf
Neben mir
Sehe die ganzen anderen Rapper hässlich aus
Ich laufe durch die Stadt
Über mir die Lichtreklame
F zu dem L - E
Is das was ich dem Richter sage
Ich fahr mit G-Hot los
7er BMW er fliegt
Wir holen Silla ab
Südberlin ist Kriegsgebiet
Ich hab nicht aufgegeben
Das ist wie ein Marathon
Atme ein atme aus
Du hast gewonn'

Du musst an dich glauben
Weil keiner an dich denkt
Du musst was erreichen
Weil keiner dir was schenkt
Denn das leben ist 'ne Nutte
Und dann gehst du drauf
Doch solange du nicht drauf gehst
Steh wieder auf

Ich bin in mein besten Jahren
Heute leb' ich dis'
Wovon wie träumten als wir 16 waren
Is' schon krass wie schnell die Zeit vergeht
Doch ich hab kein Plan A, Plan B
Ich hab ein Plan fürs ganze Alphabet
Mein Vater wünscht es sich
Mach doch was Vernünftiges
Auf der anderen Seite sagt er
Mach es wenn du glücklich bist
Ich bin diesen Weg gegangen
Ab jetzt gibt's kein Zurück mehr
Kein Rückwärts
Jeden Tag komm ich meinem ziel
Ein Stück näher
Doch das Leben sie ist eine Bitch
Und scheißt auf dich
Du hast dich warm angezogen
Doch es hat dich kalt erwischt
Ich wollte nie so ein Grasticker sein
Keine Lust auf festen Job
Arschkriecherei
Und so geht es weiter
Bis sie die Drogenfahnder kriegen
Oder irgendwann abgestochen
In der Notaufnahme liegen
So kann es gehen
Wenn man nicht weißt was gleich passiert
Doch egal wie es ausgeht
Ich bleib bei dir

Du musst an dich glauben
Weil keiner an dich denkt
Du musst, was erreichen
Weil keiner dir was schenkt

Ihr seid süß, ihr wollt beißen mit den Milchzähn'
Ihr seid Schwänze ihr wollt kiffen und dann chilln gehn
Ich streue Salz in deine Wunde, du kleiner Junge
Muck nicht auf in meinem Dorf, ihr seid meine Hunde
Warum weinst du gestern warst du noch so groß mit Hut
Ich bin ein König, ich hab blaues und kein rotes Blut
Ich kontrolliere diese Schlampe, das Rapgame
Verbrechen lohnt sich du musst es einfach weg nehm'

Und stehle dir die Show, Bastard
Wer hält es aus wenn er fällt, der schwere Regen
Es gibt kein German Dream, Du musst in diesem Elend Leben
Scheiß auf dein Freestyle Battle, Small Talk
Du hörst die Übernahme heut in jedem Call-Shop
Ich leb' in dieser Stadt, in der so viele Scheitern
Sie wollen dich unten Sehn, denn unten bist du für sie greifbar

Meine Lederjacke wetterfest
Dreimal darfst du raten, wer von uns hier besser rappt
Steck das Messer weg, Junge, wenn das Messer steckt
Wirst du ge-Eko-Fresht, guck es geht rattattat
Les' die Bibel nur selten, der dreiundzwanzigste Psalm
Von der Straße ins Heim, mit der Skyline allein
Check den Wetterbericht, du bist nicht besser als ich
Wenn die Karriere schon vorbei ist, warum stressen sie mich
Leute wollen mich in die Knie zwingen, doch als es schief ging
Stand ich wieder auf, für mein M-A-S-Kulin Ding
Wenn Rapper vor der Tür stehen, warum klingeln sie nicht
Ich will es nicht mehr sagen, Shizoe komm und sing es für mich

Im Auge des Sturms
Zieh' ich über das Land, mit Zepter und Mic in der Hand
Im Auge des Sturms
Bin ich immer allein und das kann auch für immer so bleiben
Im Auge des Sturms
Ist der Himmel so grau, doch egal, meine Augen sind blau

Fler,"Ich stehe morgens auf und weiß, was zu tun ist
Mache mir mein Frühstück, ein Kilo Thunfisch
Ich ziehe mich schnell an, denn ich muss zum Fitness
Trainiere nicht seit heute, nur weil es gerade In' ist
Ich laufe aus dem Haus, hab die Tupperbox dabei
Jeden Tag der gleiche Scheiß, Putenbrust und Reis
Ich bin schlecht gelaunt, von dem schlechten Wetter
Jeder glotzt mich an, denn ich bin ein Rapper
Fahre zu McFit und lauf rein in das Studio
Hier ist wie im Urlaub: Handtücher und Jugos
Überall nur Kanaks, die die Hantelbank besetzen
Wie sie sich verletzen mit 20-Kilo Sätzen
Auf einmal geht es los, ein Kanak provoziert
Ich guck ihn böse an und der Kanak kollabiert
So läuft es jeden Tag, jeder stresst mein Leben
Ich bin nicht arrogant, doch ich rede nicht mit jedem

Die Kanaks, die Deutschen, der Schulhof, die Lehrer
Du weißt, Man, im Ghetto kennt mich jeder
Die Politesse, die Hure, der Bulle, der Hehler
Du weißt, Man, im Ghetto kennt mich jeder
Die ganzen Gangster , Die Homies im Knast und
Der Gesa
Du weißt, Man, im Ghetto kennt mich jeder
Und mein Auto Elektrofensterheber
Du weißt, Man, im Ghetto kennt mich jeder

Ich laufe aus McFit und stehe auf dem Parkplatz
Eine Runde Kanaks, sie sehen es auf mein Arsch ab
Dieser feige Bastard, er traut sich nicht alleine
Hater bleiben Hater, alles faule Schweine
Ich schnappe mir den Größten und gib ihm eine Faust
Er landet auf dem Asphalt und die Nutte bounced
Die anderen greifen an, ich flüchte in den Wagen
Adrenalinschub, mein Puls er ist am rasen
Ich fahre zum McDrive, erstmal Cola Light
Der Verkäufer er guckt hoch, Range Rover-Style
Es gibt viel zu tun, G-Hot ruft mich an
Halbe Stunde später, dann komm ich im Studio an
Ich erzähl' ihm was passiert ist, er sagt, der Typ heißt Farid
Er kennt ihn von 'ner Party, der Bastard nennt ihn Abi
Doch jetzt wird erst gerappt, den schnappen wir uns später
Überall sind Zeugen, denn im Ghetto kennt mich jeder

Die Kanaks, die Deutschen, der Schulhof, die Lehrer
Du weißt, Man, im Ghetto kennt mich jeder

Und mein Auto Elektrofensterheber
Du weißt, Man, im Ghetto kennt mich jeder

Wir warten vor dem Haus, 23 Uhr
Klettern durch das Fenster, beide auf den Flur
Der Bastard liegt im Bett, und nuckelt an seinem Daumen
Ich klatsch ihn an die Wand, yeah und die Nutte bounced
Ich häng' ihn aus den Fenster, der Typ ist schwer geschockt
""Was bist du für ne Pussy, ist doch nur der erste Stock""
Wir müssen langsam weg hier, die Nachbarn rufen Bullen
Mit einem Bein im Knast, dieser Bastard ist dran schuld
Wir jumpen vom Balkon, und botten in den Park
Der Hurensohn, er weiß ab jetzt, dass niemand mich verarscht
Auf einmal geht es los, die Bullen haben nur gewartet
Sie schlagen uns zusammen und wir liegen auf dem Rasen
Die Fresse ist am Bluten, die Zukunft ist im Arsch
Der Richter gibt 3 Jahre, dieser Bastard nimmt uns Maß
Auf einmal wach ich auf, und weis was zu tun ist
Mache mir mein Frühstück, ein Kilo Thunfisch

Fler,"Schau dich um, alles was du siehst ist dein Problem
Es ist nicht meine Schuld, dass es nicht lief in deinem Leben
Damals fing es an mit Anis rappen, Rap presenten
Doch mein Mentor hatte plötzlich Kon­kur­renz­den­ken
Ich hab es nie verstanden, warum warst du so ängstlich?
Wir hätten jeden ficken können, CCN unendlich
Ich hab es akzeptiert, du warst kein Anführer
Du tauschtest unsre Träume ein für ein paar Clan-Brüder
Du hast mich verraten und nanntest mich ""Flerräter""
Dir zu vertrauen, war damals schon ein Rie­sen­feh­ler
Und auf einmal stehen die Gangster vor der Haustür
In dem Moment, wo ich meine Freundin ausführ
Ihr überschreitet Grenzen, die Freundin, sie ist heilig
Und dass ihr mich jetzt eine Snitch nennt, ist ziemlich peinlich
Wär ich eine Snitch, hätt ich Anis angezeigt
Weißt du noch bei MTV? Egal, das ist Vergangenheit
Doch ich stieg auf, wie Phönix aus der Asche
Mit Beko, mit Umut und ein paar Kröten in der Tasche
Ich holte Silla weg von Orgi, dann kam SBM
Denn I Luv Money Records war einfach nicht effizient
Silla hat Talent, aus Silla kann was werden
Er musste aufhörn' zu saufen, um nicht dran zu sterben
Ich ging zu Groove Attack, ich hab n Deal, er hat n Deal
Ich lasse Taten sprechen, andre Rapper quatschen viel
Keiner wollte G-Hot eine Chance geben
Darum musst' ich G-Hot eine Chance geben
Zu dieser Zeit kam' sie alle bei mir angestrichert
Sowie Motrip, Nicone und hundert andre Pisser
Das war die Zeit, wo Beko in den Club ging
Gemeinsam unterwegs, ich liebte dieses Club Ding
Dann kam der Streit und ich musste mich entscheiden
Musste mich entscheiden zwischen diesen beiden Seiten
Ihr könnt euch denken, wie oft bei mir die Kripo war
Und mir erzählte, dass der Anschlag von Bushido kam
Ich meinte nur ich verweigere die Aussage
Und lief dann weiter, alleine auf der Hauptstraße
Dann rief Bushido an, wollte wieder Bruder sein
Arafat wollte mich bei Ersguterjunge signen
Ich sagte nein, zwei Alben und dann geh ich wieder
Sido disste mich, es wurde immer negativer
Ich wollte helfen, machte für Bushido Beats klar
Und Djorkaeff, er war so unloyal wie Beatzarre
Auf einmal war's so anstrengend mit Flizzy-Fler
Und diese ""Freunde"" taten so als wenn sie busy wären
Dann nahm ich Gan-G und gründete ein Label
Und auch wegen Bushido ist er heute nicht der­sel­be
Dann nahm ich Reason als Manager im Psalm-Store
Er wollte Rapper sein, ich streckte ihm Gehalt vor
Doch er beklaute mich, ich stellte Umut ein
Und heute stellt Nicone irgendwas bei Youtube rein?
Was du laberst nehm' ich nich für wahre Münze
Hun­dert­tau­send Blutsauger, ja du bist der schlimmste
Du kleiner Parasit, du siehst behindert aus
Du bist der Junkie der im Club nach nem Fünfer schaut
Du warst mein Fahrer, mein Bimbo, mein Getränkehalter
Du hast 'ne Tochter, doch du kokst bis ins Rentenalter
Du warst am lästern, Nicone über G-Hot
Nicone diese Biatch, jetzt fährst du wieder Fiat
Du weißt genau, was ich für dich getan habe
Ich werd' dich knechten - Erzieherische Maßnahme
Und jetzt zu Animus, du hast auf meiner Couch gepennt
Du machst auf intellektuell mit deinen Tausend Fans
Du bist kein Ehrenmann - Fame Bitch Animus
Im Artemis kommst du Schlaffi nich' zum Samenerguss
Ich hab dich hingestellt und hab dich angezogen
Doch du kleine Stricher-Schlampe hast mich dann betrogen
Du warst nie bei Maskulin gesigned Nutte
Du bist kein Rocker, ich fick dich auch allein Nutte
Ich machte Mixtapes um dich zu unterstützen
Und als Dank lästerst du jetzt hinter meinem Rücken
Ich nahm dich mit nach Paris zum Videodreh
So ein Luxusleben hast du vorher nie gesehen
Es kam von Herzen doch du fühltest dich herab gesetzt
In den Boutiquen war nie was herab gesetzt
Deine Katja, kann blasen diese Fettsau
Sie macht sich wichtig obwohl keiner ihren Dreck braucht
Scheiß auf Bruce, auf Produes und auf Boris
Und diese Katja geht jetzt Kit Kat und macht Bondage
Ich rap das hier, dass jeder jetzt die Wahrheit weiß
Ihr faulen Schweine wusstet nie was echte Arbeit heißt
Jetzt komm' die Ratten aus den Löchern bei RapUpdate
Und dieser Congo, der die Wahrheit dann im Netz verdreht
In was für einer Scheiße ich hier lebe
Keiner Hat mehr Anstand oder Ehre
Ich hab 99 andere Probleme, weil ich mit dem LKA nicht rede
Und Bushido wollte CCN mit Haft machen
Für dich is' CCN 'ne Bitch, du schickst sie anschaffen
Jetzt komm' die Deutsch-Rapper, jeder macht auf Bruderschaft
Lutscht doch Schwänze, euer Arschloch ist ein U-Bahnschacht
Ich mach Urlaub in Miami auf dem Jet-Ski
Man es wird Zeit, dass diese Szene mir Respekt gibt
Ich hab gehört, Farid macht jetzt Urlaub da
Heute Bang, früher war nur Urlaub da
Du hast schon Schellen von Berlinern kassiert
Und kannst sicher gehen, dass es morgen wieder passiert
Farid hatte Glück mit seiner Marktlücke.. Idiotenrap für Hartz-Krüppel
Du willst boxen? Spiel mal lieber Basketball
Du siehst aus wie ein Rentner nach dem Schlaganfall
Und wenn ich mit dir fertig bin hilft auch kein Tapout
Ich steck dir Möhren in den Arsch, bis zum Black Out
Du nennst mich Hurensohn? Dann kennst du meine Mutter nich'
Ich spritze deine Schlampe an mit meiner Buttermilch
Und dieser Toony denkt ehrlich er wird morgen was?
Du musst nur Fler dissen, Farid hat es vor gemacht
Du musst Schauspieler sein sowie Felix Blume
Sowie Felix Blume, eine Edel-Hure
Du siehst aus wie ein Kinder-Ficker, scheiß Student
Ich schieß auf dich, deine Uni und dein' scheiß Dozent
Schau dich an Junge, du bist nur ein schwuler Boss
Du halbes Hemd, fährst du Fahrrad bei der Tour de France?
Ihr ganzen Opfer trainiert nur wegen Frank White
Rappt nur wegen Frank White, doch keiner ist wie Frank White
Seitdem wir da sind, seid ihr alle Bodybuilder
Doch ihr habt Style, die Pickel-Kinder auf den Party-Bildern
Diese Rapper sind für dieses Land hier maßgeschneidert
Möchtegern-Großstadtkiddies in der Straßen-Einfahrt
Eure eignen' Fans sind bereits am haten
Jetzt seid ihr rich Kids und seid nicht mehr dieselben
Die Anzahl meiner Neider ist mein Bankkonto
Du bist nur ein Spast Congo
Warum peilt keiner hier was Rap ist?
Oder Timing, oder Groove oder was Trap ist?
Warum bin ich als Deutscher in der Minderheit?
Warum machen Gangster-Rapper heimlich bei mir Klingelstreich?
Warum gibt es keine echten Freunde?
Und warum schiebt er Welle, dieser Deutsche?
Jeder will ein Star sein, um jeden Preis
Doch weiß nicht was „ein Star sein“ im Leben heißt
Ich drehte Videos mit Rockern, Residenzstraße
Ein guter Rücken in Berlin ist Existenzfrage
Denn nach Bushido muss jeder eine Gang haben
Ihr könnt mal gerne Farid Bang fragen
Was wollt ihr mir erzählen? Ich war mein Leben lang alleine
Ohne Rücken oder irgendeine andre Scheiße
Ich bin der Deutsche und ich geh den harten Weg
Du wirst kein' zweiten wie mich jemals auf der Straße sehen
Man bin ich froh, dass es mit uns nich geklappt hat
Doch scheißegal, ich bleib der Junge mit Charakter",Junge mit Charakter

Du bist auf Bewährung, Schatz, bloß nicht wieder ausrasten
So viele Schlampen die bloß wieder an mein Geld wollen

Nicht nur'n Gesicht, was sich sehen lässt
Keine, die mich einfach stehen lässt
Ich hab es gleich gewusst, wir beide gegen der Rest der Welt
Ich kauf dir Louboutins, für mich ist das nur Wechselgeld
Denn du bist meine Rückendeckung in jeder Schlacht
Und befreist mich vor dem Schmerz, der mich geknebelt hat
Du machst mich besser, wenn jeder mich sonst schlecht macht
Bist meine Bitch, meine Frau und meine Schwester
Du bist mein Engelein und steckst 'ne Menge ein
Und bist loyaler als die Jungs, die in der Menge schrei'n
Denn du bist rein ich trage dich auf Händen, Baby
Mit dir fing es an, mit dir wird es enden, Baby
Ich hol' dich ab und wir gehen essen mit Weißwein
Ich bin ein Bad Boy, doch bei dir Mr. Nice Guy

Deutscher Rap, er hasst mich, weil ich zu viel provoziere
Großer Wagen, große Fresse, große Ziele

30 Gs im Monat, Schlampen fallen in Ohnmacht

Cruise durch die City, 24/7
Keine Angst vor'm Fliegen, Beamer vierradangetrieben
Mach in 24/7 24 Riesen
Ihr seid maskuliner, doch wir sind am maskulinsten
Mein Auto ist ein Sixer, mein Waschbrett ist ein Sixer
Ich rase durch den Blitzer, überfahre ein paar Hipster
Ja, ich bin ein neureicher, gottverdammter Wichser

Ich präsentier' dir meinen Block, als wär mein Schädel aus Chrom
Tote Blicke zieren die Perspektivlosigkeit
Verschiedene Kulturen, doch die Meinung ist gleich, fick die Polizei!

Lauf die City im Balenciaga-Kicks

Coogi-Sweater für ein halbes Vermögen

Ausnahmezustand im Viertel mit Bantus

Früher in den Block, da war ich immer die Connection
Mit Yankee-Fitted-Cap, Kette bis zum Unterleib und sie scheint wie geölt
Fahr' bei Nacht durch die City, die Scheiben getönt

Belvedere Flaschen auf Eis in 'nem Bottich

Private parken auf allen Events
Alle Bitches wie Tyra Banks
Alle Hater auf einmal Fans
Bin wie ich bin, brauch' den Macho nicht spielen
Jump' in die Menge seit Aggro Berlin
Streit mich mit jedem seit CCN 1
Das Leben im Heim, war 'ne Trainingseinheit
Alle bekamen nur, was sie verdienen
Es lagt nicht an mir, denn es lag nur an ihn
Nie mit der Masse, nur gegen den Strom
Ihr Hater habt heute so viel Sympathie
Wieder der Szene drei Jahre voraus
Fangt ihr damit an, hör' ich grad' damit auf
So ein Badboy, selbst Personal-Trainer verklagen mich auch
Ich glaube, der Richter ist in mich verliebt
Warum schreibt er mir sonst jeden Tag einen Brief?
Hab' es prophezeit und es ist passiert
Jeder macht jetzt Trap, ich hab' nicht phantasiert

Nehm' deine Schwester und fick' sie im Tesla
Unsere Feinde im Benzer, die Scheiben durchlöchert

Egal wie und was-was sie reden
Ich lass sie, lass sie, lass sie reden

Yeah, falsche Freunde spielen gute Mine
Wären sie da, hätt' ich den Albumdeal nicht unterschrieben
Sag, endlich leb' ich meinen Scheiß Traum
Ironie, denn du schläfst in dieser Zeit kaum
Ja, es ist nicht immer wie die Lage scheint
Nutten ficken Freunde nur, um mir dann nah zu sein
Ich schwör', meine Seele ist schon kalt
Gottes Segen hält uns jung, denn Probleme machen Neid, sei
Hutsam in wen du Zeit investierst, denn
Jeder will nur vom Hype profitieren und
Jeder sagt dir, wie sehr er dich liebt
Den Fame hättest du schon eher verdient, klar
Alle setzen auf die Unterschrift
Nie gedacht, denn wir kamen aus der Unterschicht
Da, wo sie jeden Tag ins Gesicht lachen
Online gehen und dann lästern über ihre SHIFT-Tasten, doch
Vertrau', ich hab' die Hunde im Sichtfeld
Beschütze die Gang, dass sie steht und durch nichts fällt, denn

Und ich pack' das alles in ein paar Takte

Alte Labellogos und paar Hundenamen
Hundert Rapper hab' ich schon gepusht, du weißt

But nothing comes away
It's still day one

I put two feet on the ground
And walk to the end of the line
We take what we can get
By way of killing time

What can I tell you?
I'm at a dead end
She is a best friend
Says I'm at a loose end

You know where you stand
When it's hand over hand
But there's no beginning
And there is no end to a circle
It's day one, year zero

And I'm in love with nothing again
I sit here on the platform
And I nurse my drunken brain
And the train pulls in the station
And the train pulls out again

It's day one
It's day one
It's still day one",Day One
Flesh for Lulu,"Well here comes heaven
Walking down the street again
Gonna pick you up
Knock you off your feet again
Liking a living nightmare in paradise
Like a fist out of hell
With a grip like a vice
On the high wire, you can't reach me
You can't bring me down
You can't reach me
Caught a glimpse of your sad sad face
Somewhere special
Do you know the place
Where every fairytale turns real
When you start to feel
The way that I feel
On the highwire, you can't reach me
You can't bring me down
You can't reach me
You can't bring me down

Stretching out your hand, reaching out for friendliness
Staring out the window, thinking what a dirty mess
A tidal wave in time and space
When you can't fall it's such a waste
The walls of doubt are falling down
Running deep with the music loud
Flying high, don't look down
It's been so long since we walked in the moonlight
On the highwire, you can't reach me

Flesh for Lulu,"You drag this ball and chain
Across the desert plain
You build a house of cards
Around a loveless heart

Wild country in your head
Gone dead, river bed
In the dust you cry, cry, cry
There's no water in the skies

Bone dry, built on sand
A house of cards that will never stand
The doors crash open and the flood comes in
And the flood takes everything

So speak the language slow
Beg some foreign money
You're growing up on dog food
In the land of milk and honey

Shoot for the moon
Live a life out of a window
In your room, all alone
You watch the sky, watch the storm

Coming down
On your house of cards
Drink another drink
And I spill my stories

But when I wake up
I forget my stories
Magnificent in failure
Resplendent in decay

Tall tales of the land and the sea
And the tides
That tore away my house of cards

It's so hot, so hot in here
I can't sleep with you so near
And the time goes by so slow
And the night peels away like gasoline

In your room, all alone

Shoot me through the clouds, 'cause you still hold the key

Display it on my street--sense to this wannabe fool
You're live soil
That means that you're the walking dead

So when I blast that ass
You remember what you did and said
But you walking dead, ain't no comin' back
You at your resting place

You live with the soil
So up to the wasteland
(wasteland, wasteland, wasteland, wasteland, wasteland)

Now, you understand you live soil, muthafucka
Are you ready for death?
Here's your cemetery plot
That I got to be prepared for when you pussy-ass niggas drop
Live soil, which means you're the walking dead
And when I blast that ass
I make you remember what you did and said

[Flesh]
Niggas, I'm runnin' through them murda plots
Simply ninas, they cocked
In my pocket these deep when I pull and pop
Serve or hold, put it down for the double glock

Sug hit when the bullshit stops
Droppin' these shells as I bail make 'em
Live soil 'til this body smell
Leavin' a trail of bloody footsteps

Well, show no mercy
Gotta send them to Hell under this murderous spell
Flesh, Kamikaze, (?) and Boss, can all be stalkin' niggas
Caught 'em, caution, drop 'em in the coffin and fade across

Y'all loss Mo Thugs, the Shifters, and Hustla'z - 
You don't want to see this organization
Take off, will ya niggas, playa hatin' all over this nation
Station, faced, locate in the wasteland, nothin'

But heartless scandalous dealers, (pick an event/pig in a van)
And don't start with the fuckas
Hold up with the buck Mo Thugs gon' peel ya
Carry the body to the cemetery

That's where they lay 6 feet in a ditch
We went with the shotty cockin'
Prepare to murder bitches, snitches, cops on my click
Stop it! Fuck with the Fifth, I'm loyal

When ya get the job done grand and royal
Niggas got broiled, roasted in foil
Makin' the grass turn green and (rotting in gas) - live soil

Are you ready for death? 
Here's your cemetery plot

(Maniacal laughing)
...And in a town
And they're not takin' dominions like this
Flesh-N-Bone comin' at ya like this: (Laughing)

[Flesh]
Get 'em off me, in me you're feelin' I get when I'm tryin'
Your spirits get inside of me, blindin' my mind
I get stoned, like in asylum, I put a trap my mental
Get a temper, turn all violent, put a stop on my silence
Get blown, Flesh-n-Bone got the TEC
And it's on for the next, who get mo murda, murda
My Lord, never felt so many spirits all up in my system
Controllin', me listen I want to take 'em, but a nigga stay calm
Yet he lead, he wet, so wet, sweaty palms
Glocks and a bomb, I'm makin' sure that he cracked the whole area
Carry ya body, buried in your front lawn
We're confusin' to you while I'm using you fools
All abused, find us sort of like a mystery
Wonderin' how in the hell you keep losin'
Check how I keep schoolin', peep niggas (made history)
Flip of my tongue and it's over - you hung upside-down by your feet
Fin to send ya swangin', and knew somebody shoulda showed or told
Just a little somethin' shit'll get you strung out
And hangin', and I'll bet that I mangle any person
Strangle any serpent, wantin' to tangle with me
When a brawl goes down, look around at the city - tore it up
But your ass still ready when I hit and see

Mystic spirits all up in my Flesh-N-Bone deep within
One flip of my tongue and you niggas are hung
Too late
Consume in sin

[Flesh]
Fall asleep, fall deep in a nightmare
Wake up and see me standing there at the edge of your bed
Thought it was Freddy, instead it be Flesh
And he holdin' a machete steady drippin' bloody red
But I warned 'em time from time again
Time after time again, I'm a just sit back sip gin
Think on how to ? corner 'em all, consume 'em
And sent them in a murder with a Mack-10
Pack that gat, so them had it
Ready, set, aim, and straight to pull the flame off the temple
People standin' around - 
They wonderin' where did he go to get away from the po-po
Can't fuck with a nigga, man, so pull the trigger - simple bang!
Hear it, feel it ,wicked spirits in the room dance to your doom
When he had to come enter through the room pretty soon
So hell get, assume position, lay down in the tomb gone
I love the way they ?, boy, had his soul snatched from the body
Left the corpse here, struck with an exorcist, possessed him
Had to put him out of misery, get the stiff and no shadow
Nigga got to attack, so many spirits live inside, trip this
All of my mystic spirits, I get ready, make a nigga want to cry

Mystic spirits all up in my Flesh-N-Bone deep within
One flip of my tongue and you niggas are hung
Too late
Consume in sin

[Flesh]
In check, learn a lesson by the mastermind, stack
Learn to pap pap or commandin' attackin' 'em again
Feel it deep with in, seep, slowly, slide inside
I'm might take over your mesmerized friend, and in your chinny-chin
Grim niggas steady sendin' back to back blows 'til them hoes fold up
Bow down, try to get these now, nigga bound to be found
Could not ? sewed up, ready for use made you rich and sellin' out
Take yourself, nigga told on this homie, dog
And they all had a fall, hittin' stickin' 211-turned-187
When they hauled it off
Never stop when I'm gettin' my swerve on
Niggas take a fall, and then haven't you heard?
'Cause she takin' shit over, hittin', rollin' dope, bring up ?
Kilo up on your block and serve it, out the strap nigga, hang
Let my thug nuts swang, touch the pavement
Jack them when the ground get too rough pick them up and eruption
20 gauge splitters slug attackin' them in the back if ya go to turn away
Oh nigga, might kill all you fools who ain't worthy
Be the man in the city Cleveland
Everyday people in St. Clair my niggas play dirty

You're soon to be comin' up missin'
Get at your strip and my niggas talkin' 'bout murder mo
Keep me ? on hydro, blunt flow, (but I take his shit, all of it)
Runnin' with all my thugsta niggas
Better beware when I bail on the Clair
Gravedig, wig splitter, put one in ya
To the woods to ? your body
Right ? by the two of ya, tie the noose knot tight
But my niggas ain't fuckin' the ?, tell 'em not to bang
Better believe we goin' to kill all the witness
So test Flesh, gotta put 'em in check every time
Here we go march in at night
Just picture me thuggin' in Cleveland, deep in the women
Me and my green, come up with that team
So we can put a lot of fiends in the ditch, bleed
Better not sleep or you sleep with that deep
When I pap that chrome
It'll be gone, what you're fuckin' with?
The ever-rollin' Bone to the dome, you done
Flesh-n-Bone off with the gun
Quiet, so how'd they put him a casket?
Why is it niggas want violence?
I'll find him, no competition, listen
Ammuntion, let 'em have it
Can't outlast our Mo Thug niggas, smoke
Now fiend me the bud to gets me buzzed
So what if you hate me?
Keep to yourself or the haters catch a slug
And never know what it was (was)

Imitators, it gets me ? that niggas try to be like us
But can't get the hang, bet I hurt the bustas at ?
They depend on us suckas keep watchin'
You better switch and get humble
Keep our shit original, end up like a lot of niggas that droppin'
Glock-glock, double nina, infrared beam
Now die in an instant flash
Get rid of 'em, mister, ? of 'em, yeah
Try to flee and you'll meet your doom, killin' soon
Your ? get tossed to my great dane
They havin' ? handy for supper
What' s worser, don't even want a
Nigga like me to go thick
What the hell, if you really want to suffer
Stop pressin', and now what's the problem?
Niggas start the static
Always with the silver revolver
Bet I solve 'em, hollow point ?, cash and blast
Get it told, didn't feel ? with your soul
Why murder and follow, but told you
Should've slowed your roll for ?
Here I go, here I go, proceedin' to murder
Scribblin' hellified bloody scriptures
When I sneaks the green
I come to the nigga, hear the fat lady sing
It's your funeral, mister
How would you picture the story and them haters endin'
I'm forcin' the pain, bringin' the game to the table
And we able to bump off your label

Get out of line, niggas, we come to drop dimes
Whoever didn't lynch 'em becomes wig split fools, wig split fools
I'll pop and hit you with a millimeter glock, non-stop
With my favorite fuckin' tool, tool

Prepare to lose, prepare to lose
'Bout time for you ready to die, pow, pow, what am I?
Guess who, so Flesh'll be waitin', anticipatin', ?

Mossy shotty, can't help ya
Never could drop me, but I'm untouchable

Drownin' my sorrows in bottles of Olde

Come on sly, take a visit to tha heart of it all
Stead it's all good, and no key should
And though you would really wanna leave of me

Capture tha atmosphere, get addicted to me and my homies
Once you care to get amongst my kind
You go'em along of mine, neva front all day long

Goin' up to meet a pretty lady to get my boogie on for the next dance

Bitch made it known she want to fuck me because I'm a Bone
No threat, better yet I'm a pass up the ass and keep my cash

",If You Could See
Flesh-N-Bone," 

Come now say come now challenge the master
You get caught up in disaster
Blasting them between their eyes

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Come now say come now challenge the master
You get caught up in disaster
Blasting them between their eyes
Flesh be pulling mack hypnotized

[Verse 1]
All said and ditched with the pay dough
Po-po mo fucking mo fo-fo
And letting them fall, then leaving no thug
And let them all know that I'm not to be fucked with
So who's the one used in benzo
Who's the one accused, and another loosed ooh with
So bigger boy numb off the juice
So niggas beware Flesh is out of the doomster
I'm down and needed the test and the clown
Niggas around me they get down
Was housing the nigga just because he thought he must
make Flesh silly-ly kneel down
Now how many get them up quick with this feather harm
How many people can I hold
Mesmerized, then they kick my thighs
But it is my size, don't try
I'm the wise man, I knew who,when you at the land don't you understand
Mister mister, serving that sixth thugsta begging the nigga and the doctor
This shit you can pause if I pocket two
When I'mma playing, come and take an easy quiz
The original S.C.Ts. then they serving our enemies
So what they really want to do
For skitting in you
When the rest of your  homeboys coming to challenge the master
You gotta totally get destroyed
And then be fucked up
Preparing a luck, but still trying to gamble
All of his life when he picking that streph in
So I blew out his camp

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Starving straight out of Cleveland
Receiving the seed that you bubble your swig
And then they get weak
The nigga now turning to buy  you
Making you deaf like a cripple now
Come now pip out the master man ah
Then they serving you
Hitting this switch like a swisha
You don't want to miss this section
Keepin' you open now smokers
I say focused and now nobody expects me from do-boobing this
So po stay down after mine, again I'm doing my thing
Forget it, I'm taking control hoe
Who pull the-the A.K. killing nigga now
But then if he wants sucking fools
Po-po swoop it to do the, shoot the A.K.
Kill 'em all, fuck 'em all recruit umm
In the dissing, call fifth dog
But you can call me on again, letting my sawed-off
Haul up in the killing, Flesh shake to little feel, check it
In a second, put in the wreckable time
How many times man I told you
Never come try to contend with and again
The challenge the got blown up
Guns hanging around call it a showdown now
So you looking for me, I know home now
Hear them coughing telling the bitch that they found him now
You troop when I said and I leave
When I smoke on top of my lawn
Dun dun leaving in this stocker if I pull me gun

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm jerking crossed seas
Then come take over the border
Flesh the international player
Taking my paper chase world-wide
Get for that, choose my nigga, save it
Me now move to Los Angeles aaaaahhhhh
My jelly my bitch and they go pullin' till I dismount
So don't trip when I flip this song
Fifth dog nigga, nodding the don now
Speak sister, recover
Nevertheless you can troop dip rolling with Mo' thug
And the millennium seventh sign
Chiding Bone, don't trust me
Because they dope-farm for the land of leaves
Rebel up wasteland, wasteland none of guilt fools
Found they be live in a ditch
Flesh wants to abuse it
They die fighting for the bloody mess
Get clack-back
See not in the past to sit chief
Who's whip for you? So die fighting
I rely on you digging assassinating
Quicker be the force they be
But the brake-light to the holy fore-head
Killing, me split the scene
Then I collect my green
Heading back-back to the spot
And leaving no trailing cop
Fuck the law, they can not stop me
No so, put them off and they coughing top-drop
You all about my business
Thought they can tag for granted
Kicking my trues, creep on it come up
People take over the planet damn it

[Chorus]",The Master
Flesh-N-Bone," 

[Flesh]
Down, gotta lay me down, down, down to sleep
(Down, gotta lay me down)
I pray to the Lord that a holy ghost
Bless my soul to keep (Pray to the Lord, my soul) 
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up
Hope that he saved a place in heaven
So I pray every day for my soul he take up

Gettin' my hustle in every day
Each day, when I would get on my knees and pray
Everyday faced with all kinda playa hation
Why they want to make my sanity tighten
Pray, hey, hey, hey, and I got a bueatiful family
A lovely wife, and my little pretty daughter 
And I got two sons, handsome just like me
So I count blessing, after each blessing
Every last blessing I learned a lesson
I didn't realize my blessings keep me from stressin'
Jesus came, and died on the cross
To save us from our sins, our sins
The kingdom of heaven's at hand
How much to repent to get in
Again and again I'm sendin' my praises up above
And I don't know when I'm entertainin' angels 
So I gotta show more love
Gotta honor my mother and father with all my heart
My little brothers Steven and Stewart
We don't let demons break us apart
Yeah, you know that's a no-no for sure
I can put it on my soul
I can even put it in mode
And run the little seconds down the road
I'm ready to go
Steady rollin', leavin' these strangers
If the whole world would end tomorrow
Tomorrow just might be the end
So wait for the Lord and follow

Chorus

[Flesh]
Must you prepare for the Judgment, baby
Now, tell me what you've been up to lately
Situations steady come on the daily, no
It don't really surprise me
It don't amaze me, but it do drive me crazy
Demons, they keep tryin' to fade me, and it's so evil
All they want to do is aggrivate me
Trip, and I flip, don't make me
See even when i'm not lookin' for trouble
Trouble, it seem to come find me
That's how it is when you live in the limelight
But I don't worry, put it all behind me
Gotta get down, way down, stay down
Satan up under my foot
Gotta rebuke, and recite the scriptures from my holy book
That's when it straight shook
Look at the prophecy comin' down in history
Still it ain't no mystery, can't let it repeat
Good's gonna demolish evil
What a meraculous, wonderful victory
Ooh, yeah, Armageddon waitin' for the moment
When the lid pop, when it goes down, don't be sleepin'
Cause it'll creep on us, send a thief in the night
Watch out, wake up, stay woke
And gather more faith in Jesus, lead us
Get ready to do the will of God
So that he can keep us from the wrath of firey brimstones
Stay strong and hold onto your faith
And it won't greet you, yet meet you, deciet you
We're leadin' and walkin' through heaven's gates

Chorus

[Pray]
Our father, which art in heaven, hollow would be thy holy name

Down, gotta lay me down, down, down to sleep
(Down, gotta lay me down)
I pray to the Lord that a holy ghost
Bless my soul to keep (Pray to the Lord, my soul)
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up 
Hope that he saved a place in heaven
So I pray every day for my soul he take up
(Hallelleja, hallelleja hallelleja
Hallelleja is the highest praise/forever, Amen)

Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, how majestic is thy name in all the earth?",Say a Little Prayer
Flesh-N-Bone,"You niggaz better run
When I grab the gun for homocide
Well you know I'm about to hoo-lah
I never catch you sleeping
And I'mma pop the clip
Put it between your eyes when I should die
Need six feet in a ditch like a bitch
Just avoid the clip with the gauge
Nigga must have had a snipper
They came up pop collar
Hollow point tips to the brain
Bug to the bang I'm stuck in this game
Can't get away cause I'm in too deep
Running the street with heats
Never nigga can hang
You might as well get up and bitch defeat
If a nigga don't know way, know it now
Grab your shit cause it's going down
Fuck one time
Cause I'm on the frontline
Popping slugs with my dogs as we going down
Still hold it ground boy
You know what it is
Hit him in the face with a death kiss
Don't know what his problem was
But all I can say is that a nigga had a death wish
Should have messed with the wrong clique
Saw the nigga drop when I felt the chrome click
That's what you give or talking shit
Now you lying in the hospital
What you don't seek
Here come one in the head
Left it brain dead
Got to put it more life support
Living day by day on the edge of the lens
But he didn't realize that life was short
Now Eazy turning your sleep put your heat
My stars as I match and I creep so cold
You are the wrong nigga to fuck with
So fuck with me best believe it
You gonna reap what you sow
Reap what you sow, sow, sow, sow

Silent night
Deadly night
It's all right
Cause you are dying tonight

Silent night
Deadly night
It's all right
Cause you are dying tonight

I say, bone man here it comes
And then the weaker pumping jumping
Feel your body drubbing
As the weakest pumping jumping
Track his family dawn in him
Nigga the eardrum pumping don't get real
I'm back with the mo thug family
Nigga they creeping they sipping
Motherfucker wanna get rowdy, hardy
Had to fuck top everybody
With my nigga BG in, just stock all me
Back with the gauge in the double glock party
Hardy round for your head
Nigga what you want? Now you are dead
Blood red, blood red this only sign
Should us select the gun right
This only sign, should us select the gun
You wanna fuck with me?
Sit ain't funny when you lie in the bed
Covered up in a coffin
Motherfucker, what's happening?
Wanna fuck up my nigga like septin?
Mo thug gonna put it down rapping
Motherfucker don't stop kill mo bug
I'm down for the world
For bloody
Everybody wanna see me
Be like me, hear me
But you cannot pull down trek like me
Nigga so I just spray and spray
The king all over your ear drum
Till you start to do bleed, eternally thugs
Mo thug much love, right

Behold, better move so scold
Then it is on to fly
Then it will all haul back to my family
Nigga give a shit today
Put the ding and blood out to book
Keep eternal life there
Choose to never repent and camp on fire
Bullet proof this way
Must you prepare for consequences hanging
Soldier don't go to this section, finna get high
My bullets and brimstones
Should leave me alone but no
Such to address Flesh Bone
Make yourself for the ram of death is on
Honey nothing can try
Not as my turn then go trap all enemies
All enemies under my combat look them
Kill them and collect my local ways
???East 1999??? nigga Saint Claire
Sieving for the body body, check to them
Never no close to tuition
Murder when I'm leaving no track
Not for a maniac, it's a shame
Niggaz that feeling the blind
Niggaz they still gone change
Hang the blind go strangle thugs
Go to wreck with the mix man
Ready for rise to rising indeed
Better wait for love of a Pharaoh nothing more
To the creature churn on
Don't pay money on to sacrifice him high
I say that healing you
None of us thought that go fucking with the 5th dog
Armageddon
Don like a thief
And I can catch you sleeping in the ceiling
Go rock on my court
Stupid motherfucker that heard, that heard
Pull it it's a souvenir, then you'll blow
Niggaz deflect them, put them in glocks
Caught up in knocks
Peeling, stepping him out fucked up

Rolling in a Malibu, mobbing with Wally

We took a one-way ticket to L.A. 
Creeping on a come up, we had to meet Eazy, better believe me  
Them was the good times, dropping them good rhymes, yes indeed 
And you know we put it down for the love of the cheese, for the love of the game, and the real O.G.s
 
For the love of my Cs, I'm a let it be known
Hip hop thugsta, clique tight with the bones 
And a war been on since the first song 
Remember them Northcoast thugstas splitting your dome 

Hit em home with Tha Crossroads
Dedicated to the lost souls  
Bennefit ya, forever we miss ya 
Better believe that well never forget ya 

Take a picture and capture the moment 
On a quest for the best, its victory 
Nevertheless, we stress this history 
Is you feeling me, is you hearing me?

As we ride, as we roll, roll 
Reminiscing out the games we played 
Those were the days, those were the days 
Never let em slip away

I sending my chrome upside your dome, hater, disrespect my home, n****, lets get it on 
Fifth Dog flipped out, and its on 
Oh no, y'all testing the Flesh-N-Bone, you wrong 

Too many true soldiers set up for murder, stuffed 
Unsolved, and it makes me wonder who really involved in killing our prophets. 
Crossing them off the list, b****es

Verse 1

And when it began it was the world
And we got heard again and again
And all that the world was kept with God
In ? in it was God himself the boyfriend
And everything that was made
Was made by him
Without him nothing would be in existence
Hit them up psycho
For the life what's life
For me it's this rapping and this ? this shine
Figure it out and again
The Lord oh yes
The Lord has spoken a world
And the word was me flesh
Now every last word that is spoken from the God comes
alive
And giving it you will need it
Exercise good teaching prophesy
In the last days
Open your mind and focus your eyes
And pay attention
Listen off course to what they be kicking up words
So fix them in your eardrum
You want some now come get some
Many mo faking no less
Send and a merchant
You probably see the gift and pick it up hutch
Protest this plain it simple
Get it then let it
Mo got the blessing
Cause then he is resting
Don't let these demons mess and distract him
If you let them
Suggest you pick up the bible
Then you say hellow
Then they protect you, Holy Ghost
Here be the original cost of cig
And them all keep smoking

Chorus (2x)

Jesus wept, get to you
Nobody sought to work in his footsteps in the beginning
When he was placed on the face of the earth
Onto the cross, onto resurrection
Lots found the Lords direction
If you want to leave it there
Only Jesus Christ be willing to find
Then follow the rapper the Lord got here
Who ever think now but the change
They got chains bound to their souls
Oh no, here come on again
5th dog holler and hail they go
Letting and foe
Flesh harass those so cold
When I put it down rapping
You want to diss this out it
Never then put my pistol in your mouth
What's happening monster?
Break off the enemy taking more conches
Leave it alone to sieve in the world
I'm taking no nonsense
His coming since defeat them and you stay
And safe up with your own last
Put your ass
Keep sending and ever repent
Take a look at your past
You nothing like in the first lane
You seemingly suddenly like in sane
Gotta maintain
My nigga get down for your thing
And make a change
Pin pass get them up quick
Because it will be
Hear the  destruction coming I say
Hear the destruction coming
You better hurry and do something (hey)

Chorus:[4x]",Word to the Wise
Fleshcrawl,"See, open your eyes, take a look back
Find truth in the past
Your mind gliding through time
Reminds you of signs once seen, but defied

Fleshcrawl,"Made of flesh, to suffer
Sacred scars, uncover
I become the tortured one
In my wounds discover
Endless pain, forever
I become the bleeding one

Made of flesh
Forged in blood
Raised in fear and torn apart
Still alive soon to die
Till will come to say goodbye

Blessed in hell, forgotten
Souls dispelled, unbroken
I belong where death is strong
Destiny is calling
Set me free, no mourning
Silent wings of death and fear will swing

I feel
Pleasures of death
In war against myself
No life
Remains in my flesh
Rest in hollow graves",Made of Flesh

Once forgotten scathing eyes

Seeking the void

Scourge of the bleeding haunted
Death and disdain, forever in pain
Scourge of the bleeding haunted
Revel in hell, bloodshed will tell

Staring into evil eyes
Fear beyond the truth will rise
Slavery of maggots will reign
Tortured human flesh remains

Once and for all
Covered in sin
Tainted in blood

Trapped in burning graves

When agony recalls
A touch of evil strikes
When life surrenders

Emerging emptiness
A banished soul to bless
My fading candle dies
When life surrenders

In twisted dreams my life will cease
The other side
My buried soul
In rotten soil
The end of time

Rhythm in their hips and in their lips and in their eyes
Where do highbrows find the kind of love that satisfies?
Underneath the Harlem moon

They don't pick no cotton, picking cotton is taboo
They don't live in cabins like the old folks used to do
Their cabin is a penthouse up on Lennox Avenue
Underneath that Harlem moon

They just live for dancing
They're never blue or forlorn
Ain't no sin to laugh or grin
That's why darkies were born

They shout, ""Hallelujah"" every time they're feeling low
And every sheik is dressed up like a Georgia gigolo
You may call it madness but I call it hi-de-ho

Fletcher Henderson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Lost, but happy, at sea
Petrov and Yelyena said to me 
""Shouldn't we have something to eat?""

Well, I say 
""There are plenty of fish in the sea""
But all they can see, is me.

They say, ""Any last requests?"" 
Biding my time, I say ""Yes.
I want to party, just we three. 
Lost, but happy at sea.""

So we drank all night from the keg
I passed out, then awoke with one leg
I said, ""Petrov, have you seen my leg?""
He said ""No"" and he went back to bed
But he looked suspiciously well fed.

Three days later they were hungry again
They said, ""Any last requests, again, my friend?""
I said, ""Do you know any Rolling Stones?
You know, like you're at a rock concert going ""More, more!""

""Ah, it was a hilarious hilarious moment in a very bleak bleak time of my life.""

So we danced all night to the Rolling Stones,
When I awoke they were chewing on bones.
Yelena was supping blood from a cup,
That's when I knew something was up.

""Hey Petrov?""
""What?""
""What is that you're eating?""
""Nothing""
""It looks like a meat.""
""Oh, this? It's um, one of those, um, fish.""
""How come it looks so much like my arm?""
""It's an.... arm fish.""
""What about the fingers?""
""Fish fingers.""
""Well, you see, the thing is, my arm seems to haveabeen 
Hacked off at the elbow last night. I was just wondering if you might have seen it.""
""Oh, yeah, look at that, no arm over there. 
Oh, don't you hate it when that happens? 
I don't know, um, you were very drunk last night. 
Perhaps you lost it?.. In a fair game of chance.""
""Oh, you're probably right.""
""Yeah, you know how it is when we're drunk.""
""Yeah""
""'You say 'I'll bet my arm'""
""Oh.""
""Just relax. Enjoy the sea, and have some more, fish.""

You really would be proud of yourself.""
""How can I? You have eaten all of my leg!""
""Ooh, someone obviously isn't getting any.""

Late that night, while they were asleep,
I swallowed some arsenic to poison my meat
I was very ill, but revenge is so sweet
Unlike the last meal my comrades would eat.

""Yes, eat it all up. 
Not so sweet all of a sudden, hm?""

Rambling through the avenues of time
When from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl
And by chance her eyes fell onto mine
So I sat and acted all non-nonchalant
She smoked her lavender cigarette
Reading the future that lay in my hands
My shadow played a bass clarinet
(where you going with this bret?)

We waltzed down a moonlight boulevard
Just two silhouettes in the mist
(ah yes)
Days went by and years went by
Moments went by when we kissed
(when was this?)
She said your beard is woven of heartache
And we'll drink for the lonely tonight
And the moon is a horny old drunkard
(uh bret, could you please move over to your right?)
We drank dandelion wine and we reminisced
About the moment we first met that day
(I'm trying to watch tv)
Then we reminisced about how we first reminisced
(oh yeah? sounds a bit gay)
She handed me a broken memory
A keepsake to forever most say?
A brief taste of love is as sweet as any
And with that she made her way
(oh yeah? what was her name?)

She said her name was a secret
Then she said her name was Cherie
(was her middle name Cherie
So it's a secret Cherie maybe?)
Mm, maybe
(what'd she look like?)
She looked like a Parisian river
(what dirty?)
She looked like a chocolate eclair
(that's rare)
Her eyes were reflections of eyes
(oh nice)
And the rainbows danced in her hair
(aw yeah)
She reminded me of winter's morning
(what frigid?)
Her perfume as eau de toilette
(what's that mean?)
She was comparable to Cleopatra
(quite old)
She's like Shakespeare's Juliette
(what thirteen?)

As we waltzed through the streets of Manhattan
On rivers of ribbon and sailboats of song

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Flip Phillips,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You

Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love

What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above

Flip Phillips,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Star Dust

Quick on the draw
Lick a paw
For loved ones blood runs cold in the winter wars
Check the criminal thoughts

Stay focused like photo lens

Never fuck with these herbs

Black napsack with something for ya gut
Wooly-type skully
Fully strapped, black bulletproof, and match
Quick,

Of bullets to blow up the map

Nigga what, it's crunch time for me to shine
I'm a show you easily for me to take mines
Pass my nickel plated nine, call me Einstein
Buck a shot two times and stick you for your rhyme
Put you in a pine box
You and your whole family's on detox
Hustlin crack for Reeboks
Holy socks, cut you with my ox

Leave em all stiff, blow smoke from this foul drift

As I speak the shit to put my name on the list
The small thug with a slug put a mark on his wrist
A tattoo of pyramids, puttin hollows in clips
Peeped your gat, jammed tight, Ross your lookin to riff (what the fuck?)
QB's type shit, cause we runnin your clique
See me in the drop, with your six, sayin she snitched
But never that, 'cause-o, high beam through the window 
My lookouts move slow, they heard you never blast though
Got a safe in your crib, sham, you know the code
Search, spoke out, 3, 2, 1, that's zero
Took the see notes and flip mode left on the quietest note
Swallowed these then cleared your throat

Sing , rap , act or be a host like Ananda
Type spoken true zonin out in the vocal booth
How I do that? Found new raps with tight blonde streaks in the middle
Or die blue black
Q grill write the ill make you raise your brow
And still be the illest mad years from now
All the way hell out

[Baby Sham]
Ayo the realness , start from back in the days
In QB , when niggas had they grimy ways
Up in the street when thugs had to hold they heat but never me
I slipped them off they own two feet
If you don't know I think you besta keep your flow
I'm the type of cat that'll just split your fro
And leave a big part you don't really want it to start
Catch you on a sunny day in front your crib double park

We shine in the dark blink of an eye the last spark
Get closed up, first thug nigga hold up

Deeper and deeper
Nigga's vision start to black out, straight Grim Reaper
Still lookin for that nigga Peter

Caught up in this foul mix-up
Tore wide open, bitch'll need a major stitch-up
Dig a ditch up where no blood-hound'll sniff up

Fled from the scenery without nobody seeing me

Ain't nothin to it, brother i got the heart to do it
Blast in, cover the sidewalk wit ya fluid
Ya niggas stupid, ya got brains, brother use it
Ain't nithin gonna stop my black ass, from gettin cash

So if you ain't doin shit , ya niggas need to dead it
Watchin my money, it cost bullets in ya tummy

Watch you bitch ass suffer til you got to beg for ya moms
Now turn the truck on, get ya fuck on, got you stuck on
Stupid right between yo legs, get yo suck on

Eat avacado, soon to go purchase a white Diablo
Niggas know my motto, lets get money, Macho Camacho
Applaud another rapper, lets go collect the nacho
Oh shit, hope you don't slip, another murder commit
The episode comin on Teen Summit
Little corny nigga talk too quick, think he slick
Throwin a brick, yappin off, lyin on his dick
Too late, you'll be the type o' nigga that I love to hate
Brutally bust ya shit like a nigga turned primate
Time of the year, feel great, clean slate
Throw a nickle plate, property shoppin to but a landscape
How they say street niggas 'ill never have
Now we possess the 5S wit the cherry red Nav
Doin things like signin graffiti on autograph
Gettin so much money staff calculate the math
Laugh you know the half, eyin in the stash
Mediatin watch the wind blow the blunt ash
You had a blast , now how long you gonna last
Ice grillin for nothing, you make yoself ass
Brace yoself one more time, know what i mean dun
Violate cross the foul line, it be yo last one

Movin' like one in unison
Beg your pardon

What they call me
A hundred on a Harley
Out of nowhere, and keep you surfin' like Brawley
Narley! I'm the bitch with the pistol
Woody Woodpecker or L.L. at the Bristol
Official stand, hold it down in Trent
Then link up at the tunnel with the rest of my camp
Paper like Meade, I'm in the mix like Speed
And be screamin' on the mic till my tonsils bleed
Yeah that's the way it is
Like when a kid get christened
Like comin' to the bricks to find your whip missin'
Rockin' uptown, on down to west Howston
Houston, peace to my bitches that's boostin' 
After juicin', I'm a straight black ball a rapper
Tap a nigga's nerves like them hackers
Be goin' on the modem, I get the call from the dispatcher
Then show them mother f'ers what I'm after

Yo I back slap a wack m.c. for trying to be
Something he not, pull his card, blow up his spot
Nigga talkin' bout murder but ain't committin' one
Niggas talkin' bout gats but ain't bustin' one
Yo, I see you in the ? portayin' like you a thug
Yea, your man got a gat, but he ain't bustin' no slug
You
You's a local black spokesman, I split your front open
Vicious knife wound, fucked up like Ron Goldman
Spliff, I spit, fully equipped for any bullshit
Grew up with the bad and ugly, quick to pull shit
Ignorant, vulgar, on your tape recorder
Idol to your son and probably lover to your daughter
Fatman son, wilted grandson, ? nephew, Frank the cousin

Uh huh, one more time, uh huh, spliff, come on
Bust my gun, like Colombians
Make niggas collapse like fucked up lungs

Better obey the laws of the land
Or lay still like soldiers of fortune in Nam
Closed coffin with flags folded in half
Triangular shape, blow out the candles with grace
For fabulous tastes, some will, battle for space
Pay the ultimate price, poltergeist
Put the holy ghost in your life, bring you closer to Christ
Focus your dice, when the vulture's in flight
Re-sculpture the mic, then smash heads like the opium bite
Prophet in vein, Metropolis claim body and soul
ID's controlled in the optical frame
Never stoppin' the game
Remove your squad with steady plans
I body slam punks like Superstar Billy Gramm'",Straight Spittin

For me to call shot
Cock block my life
Add a little spice
Devil eyes snake rise on dice
Have your fam call christ
Flipmode battle for mics
All my shit be high priced

Liftin thugs out they crease it's quickly
Shift two keys in two weeks
And gross forty g's

We got it locked on the next bike

Solo or collective
My perspective the objective
Is to win
All praises due to my squad one in the same
Cherish every blessing I have to make y'all witness my name
Burn another calorie

Put your money where your mouth is double your salary

Bust your shit bouncin in a Honda Prelude

All you sucker MC's, try to hide this stuff. Come back here.
Where you think you goin', nigga. Come back here.
Y'all niggaz ain't seein' Jack. Shit !!!

Aiiyo, speak the truth.
Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin' hertz.
Freestylin' of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin' my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes"".
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin' me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin' yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin', hopin' you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas
Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open
If you fuck wit my squad nigga where you think you goin'?

Where you think you goin'.

Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.
Where you think you're goin'.
Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.
Where you think you're goin.

I'm a hard man at work.
Lyrical expert.
Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.
Ramp I be the mastermind.
That's be full time watch me shine.
I know the seven sign.
I'm rich, and still life is a bitch.
Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.
Jim Baker. I take you're life like the undertaker.
Flipmode moneymaker, make that kill for this paper.
It's on the poppin'.
People want to know when the album droppin'.
Start talkin'. Keep walkin'.
Flatbush New York and we live for you.
Sling for you.

Diamond rings. Nice cosy things.

Splash rain potters pooves.

Chuff for choose.
Scoffer booves.

Smash crew like statue with jungle jewels.

Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.

Turn away, turn away from the wall
Face me now, Face me now
Show me, show me all your tears
Your pain, your pain makes me burn

It's my shame
It's my shame we both hurt
We both hurt

I've got to strip this flesh from my bones
I've got to hammer this wall with my hands
With my hands

And I saw you
I saw you shine
I was holding you

I saw your face. I saw our face as you heard my words
My words
And you left me. You left me to hold yourself

And I've got to strip this flesh from my bones

But I'm not going to sing that song anymore

Flipper,"Feel so numb feel so dead
Just felt like someone hit my head
Like someone knew just what to do
Poison the masses catch the running few
Feel so empty feel so old
Just waiting to feel the death like cold
Eating away at my life ties
Not really knowing not caring why

Life is pretty cheap. sold a decade at a time
Life is pretty cheap. it's so easy to find
Life is pretty cheap. there's really nothing new
Life is pretty cheap.
Except for the cold delirious few

Dying too young living too fast
It's starting to feel like I'm living in the past
The pain is strong more than one can bear
Why is there religion. it's just not fair
People cling to things to make to make their lives seem real
Crawling like bugs at some fool leader's heels
Boasting of freedom when they're tied down with chains
It's time to give it up. here comes the death rain

Life is pretty cheap. sold a decade at a time
Life is pretty cheap. it's so easy to find
Life is pretty cheap. there's really nothing new
Life is pretty cheap.

Not living for life, but the death appeal
Who wants a cancerous boring end
When you can die from misery and following the trend?
I say ""who cares anyway? who listens to what I say? ""
This song rhymes and we play it in time

And if you wanna live in super market isles
And take your vacation by flying for miles
Take a day off and live in the lies
While others work and capitalize
I say ""who cares anyway? who listens to what I say? ""
This song rhymes and we play it in time

We're living like cockroaches in this place
Sprayed with insecticide that leaves no trace
And if we could crawl on you at night
You could be sure we'd love to bite

It's time to enlist
The people speak as one
The cattle, the crowd
Those too afraid to live

Cant you smell their stinking breath
Listen to them
Wheezing and gasping and
Chanting their slogans
The grave diggers song
Demand a sacrifice
A sacrifice

Can't you smeel the fresh blood
Steaming into the soil
As our patriots
Fathers and mothers and lovers
Admire the military style
Praising Gog and the state
Crying tears of pride
For the sons and lovers
For all the fools slaughteres
For the maimed, the dying
And the dead
So the nation will live
So the people will remain as cattle
Demand a sacrifice

Flipper,"I've seen many things 
In this world that I doubt 
Exist anywhere else 

Lives that enjoy 
Never having to be disturbed 
Exist some place else 

Love that is unbroken 
Resides in a lovers heart that 
Exists in someone else 

Passion burns so hot 
In the lust of desires need to 
Exist for someone else 

Pain is felt so hard 
In other lives who 
Exist without soul what else 

Try as they might 
Some do not want to try 
Exist forsaking something else 

The day will come 
When all those who have fought so hard 
Exist in peace where else 

I see the day 
When Ill just say that I 
Exist my love for you who else",Exist or Else
Flipper,"And I say 
Oh oh oh you never know which way to go 

And I say 
Oh oh oh the Flipper twist is in my soul 

Now all the time we spent runnin around 
City to city, any club, any town 
We got a taste of the audience zeal 
What makes them hop and bop and feel 
They want to dance and have a good time 
We gotta keep the tempo upbeat all the time 
But we are trying to do something new 
Playing discord in theory and that chord too 
Abundant vibrations so pure and true 
Move about betraying me and you 

The nations taste changes from day to day 
First its humor becoming ultra violence decay 
Its just a game of the rat eats the dog 
Lead the pack or be forever lost 
So many kings to rule just one hill 
To me its crap, I say just be real 
I have to stand out from the rest 
Vocational noise puts myself to the test 

The music squeaks, squawks and drones on 
A magic feeling where nothing can go wrong 
I lift my head proud, the feeling is bliss 
My body starts a motion and I start to twist 
Scream and shout but never resist 
even though there's no control 
Until falling down makes its cycle whole 

And I say 
Oh oh oh the Flipper twist is in my soul 

And I say 
Oh oh oh you never know which way to go",Flipper Twist

He didn't think about tomorrow 
Full speed ahead, that's all he wanted 
Another line or two would do him fine 
He had his brains all out of time 
He kinda liked it that way 
Kinda relieved it every day 
He went full speed ahead

He didn't know how to handle it, he dis it 
He couldn't figure out what it was about

He just felt everything and died

Your feelings show way deep down inside of 
you when you know your mind is twisted 
And untrue it seems so strange the range 
You claim to have to show when all your actions 
Take on a surrealistic threatening glow acting 
The way you do fuck that well you know what 
Does it show what does it prove you're in some 
Groove workin through the stages now toward 
Something new but what does it show and what 
Do you know well it pays to know it pays to know 

Now in the time you spent so well figure yourself 
Out to tell did you ever wonder why some 
Things turned out to be such lies did you look 
Deep way within and figure out where lies the sin 
Could there be a clue left out overlooked and 
Thrown about I want to know what can you show 
One thing for certain it pays to know it pays to 
Know which way you're going yes it pays to know 
It pays to know set your sail in the direction 
The winds blowin ohh it pays to know what can 
You show and what does it prove",It Pays to Know

Now you're standin by the front door

who give the truth 
become the slaves of the receivers 

Once it starts you can't believe it 
Once it starts you cannot see it 
Stripped of all but left with your senses 
All tangled up in a useless adventure

Once it starts you never see them 
Once it starts you cannot believe them 
you've torn my heart right from my chest 
Its time to give that subject to a rest

Once it starts you don't want to live then

Well stand proud and rise above

Flipper,"I´m all alone in my room
I´m sitting here near the shelf
I see the mirror on the wall
The things I do are not for my health
I live alone with my lies darker than any night
A fear so real I might die from fright
Until...someday

So I reach for my death, yes it´s the ultimate one
The needle shines sharp deep gleam into my skin
I feel the relief, I lose all the pain
And when I open my eyes it comes back right again
I start to scream deep from inside
But all that noise just won´t seem to hide the fact that
Someday someday

So here I sit the bliss lost once again
My mind conjures up images once known as sin
I gather strength to look outside
I see the lives of friends, they run and hide
And now they´re gone and what they did
So I pray to no God absolve me of no sin
I see your smile, it warms my soul
Reassuring me it´s not our time to go

Until...someday someday someday

And when i´m far away from you my dear
I miss so much the feelings we share
And I want to hold on to you so tight
Breathe my hot breath down your neck tonight
Hold on so long the feeling is real
Only one thing can replace that deal
I find the thing that makes my life surreal
A cheap replacement
Because sometimes it feels like love
(repeat 4x)

Someday someday someday

Flipper,"Now when I'm sick and tired and I'm far away from home
I need to hear your voice on the telephone
That's just what I need to feel at home
No matter how far away I am, how bad I feel
'cause there's no greater thrill in my life
Than to hear your sweet voice in my ear, it's nice
It makes the miles apart not so far
Brings hope to me like a shining star

I get so tired out when I reach over and dial out
And all I get is the stupid machine it says
""I'm not at home right now
If you know what I mean
So if you will leave your name and number
Sometime I'll give you a call back and if you don't
I won't make time for you no more, jack""

See I'm sick and tired of layin' alone
I get these cold sweats when I'm far away from home
And if I could just hear your voice one more time
I might have a little inspiration to continue
My life in a way that I can that doesn't seem
So destructive as I am but it's ok if I don't
Get you today, I'll just listen to your
Answering machine ok fucked up piece of
Shit 30 seconds and I'm cut off
No return calls (once a week)",Telephone
Flipper,"[Chorus:] 
We are not crazy, were goin insane 
Its not our fault you decided to blame 
Yourself for walkin in the front door 
you're gonna come back tomorrow 
And pay a little bit more 

Its been such a long time 
Carrying on with the same old show 
Its been such a strange time 
The burdens on the people who just don't know 
Its happening much too fast 
every moments made to fade or last 
There is no time invloved in judgements 
As I just let go of a twisted little laugh 

[Chorus] 
Now I'm left wondering 
What will become of it all 
Is there a flaw in the grand scheme of things 
A little tear through which it all falls 
are there any heroes left 
In social service to human kind 
As the madness intertwines to happiness 
We all seem blind 

[Chorus] 
Now if tomorrow didn't come 
And yesterday had no past 
You would blow your mind right away 
Cause now is a concept very few can grasp 
To practice it requires no effort 
I don't think about it at all 
And if you can't handle it 
You can always get right back in line

We are not crazy, were going insane (repeat)",We're Not Crazy

I've got to strip this flesh from my bones
I've got to hammer this wall with my hands

And I saw you
I saw you shine

I saw your face. I saw our face as you heard my words

With displays of bitter fruit

In her suitcase and drives away
Into distances and dreams

Knuckle down!

Singing painful autumn blues

From the coke and the weed and extacy
I'm lost in the streets but you still remain next to me
The blood that I bleed it flows through your veins
Even in my lowest point I can still hear your words to my brain
First time I was arrested mommas love was tested
I couldn't contest it so here's my confession you're my blessing
You're the reason I believe you're the reason I sing
You're the reason angels tangle me in heavenly things
It's been a long road so hard and cold

After the darkest night chasing all the evil away
You're my flowers and sunshine cherries and red wine
Diamonds they can't find shining through hard times
You're the angel on Earth the proof there's a God
The reason to keep on going you're my light in the dark
The first star in the sky and the last to leave
And when I'm travelin' through the night I feel your light on me

Hittin' the club give a pound and a hug to the thugs 
Later on I'm makin' love on that bear skin rug 

'Cause I'm skippin' town I'm skippin stones 
I'm skippin' town I'm skippin' stones 
I'm skippin' town I'm skippin' stones 
And all I know is I'm alone
 
I feel the vibe inside me and I'm not gonna let it go 
So come on 
And I'm laughin' and cryin' and buyin' time 
I'm not gone let it go 
So come on 
And I'm findin' a dime thata wanta good time and I'm not gonna let her go 
So come on 
And it's all on the line but I'm still gone' shine I'm not gone let it go 
Hey 
Slow it down for a minute while I capture the sky 
Surfing the clouds wind surfin' through a deep sea dive 
The devil's tryin' to get up in my soul but I'm not gone let it go 
So come on 
And I'm drinkin' this spiritual wine so he can't fuck with my flow

'Cause I'm skippin' town I'm skippin stones 
I'm skippin' town I'm skippin' stones 
I'm skippin' town I'm skippin' stones 
And all I know is I'm alone
 
Keep on runnin' through all my days 
He got a need for speed 
But what you runnin' from playa 
I think he runnin' from me 
Take ya time and just relax 
He ain't got time to take 
Slow it down and think about it 
He got moves to make 
Strugglin' and scrapin' takin' chances attemptin' to make it 
The time that was taken was tedious but fuck it we made it 
Created much later now playin' n' singin' invaded with Piper n' Dave 
And the angels bout to make us the greatest 
Somebody save us the shit that we spittin' soundin' ridiculous 
Rippin' and gifted with lyrics flavored up more than licorice 
Shift it and kick it with enough spittage to make it Sickenin' 
Skippin' stones, mama I'm gone its time to rip this shit 

'Cause I'm skippin' town I'm skippin stones 
I'm skippin' town I'm skippin' stones

Someday we gonna dance with those lions
Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'

They tellin' me it's all good just wait
You know you're gonna be there someday
Sippin' on Jim Beam ok
Gotta get these things one day
Till then do another line you know
Searching for that other high
Stop or I gotta steal then steal
Kill or I'm gonna be killed
I got a sack in my pocket
Conscious yellin' drop it
You know we're gonna lose it someday
And we tryin' to hold it all together
But the devil is too clever so
I'm gonna die you gonna die we gonna die
Someday one day I said

Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday we gonna dance with those lions
Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'

Try to lie but it ain't me
Ain't me try to look but I can't see
Can't stop right now cause I'm too far
And I can't keep goin' cause it's too hard
In the day in the night it's the same thing
On the field on the block it's the same game
On the real if you stop then it's no pain
But if you can't feel pain then it's no gain
Rearrange and you change and it's all bad
And you try to maintain but you fall back
And you crawl and you slip and you slide down
want to make it to the top better start now
So I hold my soul and I die hard
All alone in the night in the graveyard
Someday one day I'm gonna be free
And they won't try to kill me for being me
Hey someday

Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday we gonna dance with those lions
Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'

If you know how this is
Gonna see it's not that easy
Don't stop get it till it's done
From where you are or have begun
I said keep on try a little harder
To see everything you need to be
Believe in your dreams
That you see when you're asleep

Someday we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday we gonna dance with those lions
Someday we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'",Someday

Flipsyde,"Happy Birthday. So make a wish.

Please accept my apologies, I wonder what would have been.
Would you have been a little angel or an angel of sin?
Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys.
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes.
I paid for the murder before they determined the sex,
Choosing our life over your life meant your death.
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes,
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life.
Would you have been a little genius? In love with math?
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad?
Would you have been a little rapper like your poppa The Piper?
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose,
And the way you would've laughed and talked fast or slow.
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen.
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would've been.

Happy Birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed

I made a mistake

I got a million excuses, as to why you died.
And other people got their own reasons for homicide.
Who's to say it would've worked and who's to say it wouldn't have
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad.
The fear of being my father has never disappeared,
I ponder it frequently while I'm sippin' on my beer.
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
So when it came time to create, I made a mistake.
But now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you.
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we were confused.
Maybe, every time that he smiles it's you proudly knowing
That your father's doing the right thing now.
I'll never tell a woman what to do with her body,
But if she don't love children, then we can't party.
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen.
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would've been.

Happy Birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed

I made a mistake

And from the Heavens to the womb to the Heavens again.
From the ending to the ending, never got to begin.
Maybe one day we can meet face to face,
In a place without time and space. Happy birthday.

What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed

I made a mistake",Happy Birthday [*]

Just to say I love you baby
You would always treat me like a lady
Everyone was jealous of the way

Always knew that I would occupy your mind

To show me I was number one
Sitting there on my throne
Lately where's the feeling gone

No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world

That picture of everything I ever dreamed
Now the picture's crashing down around on me
Calls are coming in and we're looking at our friends
Wondering who's it gonna be
It was so good once upon a time
It was a simple time, it was a good time
Now we got the perks and all the crÃ¨me
And it's tearing us apart at the seams
But I remember

Once upon a time I was thrilled, to get yo call
Then I could get yo all
Then I could get your heart
Now ain't the same. Seem like now it's a game
Once was reckless but now it's tame
Once was real love and now it's fake
Who would've known this path we'd take

Clear the sidewalk see the stain
I will suffer nevermore
I have found an open door

I will soon have everything I've ever wanted
Revenge on my enemies will they be haunted
No worries, no feelings, no stress or fear
A permanent part of this spot right here

The wind in my face
It screams in my ear
Falling faster no one here

I will soon have time to rest and time to die
A speeding slab of concrete hits me in the eye
Broken bones that I won't get the chance to feel
I'll never cry or bitch or hurt or heal

I'm falling sirens calling
Everyone is watching me
I'm crawling lonliness mauling
Watching over me

Everybody's watching me

So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune's fallin', baby, all over the town
Be sure, be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Flo Mega,"Alles bleibt wie still
Bleibt ruhig nach dem storm
Nur ein leises ticken
Kommt von der alten Uhr im flur
Die zebrochen Glässer 
Hab ich allesamt ersätzt
Und die flecken an den wänden, 
Hinter deinen bildern versteckt

Und mir fehlt deine Stimme
Wie sie sich wild überschlägt
Und mir fehlen deinen Augen
Wie sie mich wütend ansehen
Die übertriebenen Gesten
Und wie du deine Faust hebst
Um mir zu zeigen, dass du
Mich eigentlich liebst

Alles was ich will
Kann ich jetzt auch tun
Doch wenn ich mich streite
Hört mir keiner mehr zu
Und wenn ich so lang wie ich will
Durch unsere Straßen zieh
Ist da keiner der auf mich wartet
Nur Rotwein und Aspirin

Und mir fehlt deine Stimme
Wie sie sich wild überschlägt
Und mir fehlen deinen Augen

Uh Baby,
Es tut verdammt nochmal weh
Ich würd dir alles geben
Damit du bleibst und nicht gehst

Kein bis später und Ciao
Jemand fehlt auf der Couch
Ich sammle die gefallenen Worte
Und hebe sie auf
Leg sie unters Kissen
Und vielleicht tust du das ja auch Baby

When they heading my van, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, a hundred super models

Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through

What happens to that body, it's a private show

Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough

All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

The hood never caused but they all was hard
His kind never represented love at all
Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars
Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage
Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start
I couldn't understand it, even told it to god
Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top
Access granted with this empty can of starch
No not the Bentley liquor store got robbed
Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block
Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars
Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage
Gotta make it out for real for I be at large
I wrote XXL in the view of my squad
Got a record on the shelf they say I'm good at the mall
Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow
Cause

A four course meal every first of the month
Everybody in the projects family home
Don't know you till the DJ like I want some
But before thanksgiving, was a catholic nun
Crabs in the bucket dirty 11 to 1
Without the struggle probably never would'a heard of Lebron
Try and juggle in the casket wit ya sister Lavonne
Suicide, live lavish at the tip of my tongue
Only thing come to ratchet was the 23rd song
Yeah it could of been tragic for the boy from the scums
Yeah he got the craft-matic no rest till I won
Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone
Born near the savages kinda made me numb
Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung
It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs
Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum
Cause

[Chorus: x2]

Sitting here, reminiscing,
Of all the nights I had to grind
Taking chances with the system,
I put my whole life on the line
All my life know it ain't been sweet
All my life I been in the streets
All my life up against concrete
All my life mama gave me the speech
All my life somebody died every week
All my life ducking the police
All my life without soda I weeped
All my life no first class seats

Ask me bout what a nigga done done
Ask me bout what a nigga do well
Ask me were the bricks come from
That's what a snitch nigga do they tell

Bowlegged woman that's what I need, I don't mind
Like how she flaunt it, see that's my speed, she a dime
Thought for a moment how could this be so fine?
Body bangin', I lay the language, that walk is famous
The proper anus like she was painted
She got me tainted, I gotta brang it, this woman dangerous
None other, who's her lover, this above her
Get it from her mother, did it to her brother

So hood and I'm startin', I'm blowin' see no stuck up trumpin'
Bugari I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money
I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami
She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin' my platinum my money
This ain't your normal every day baby
The type to drive nothin' less than that 600 Mercedes
It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily
That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a .380
I feel like she put me under a spell
Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell
Shorty ridiculous, I had a mission to conquer the gal
I put her on my tab, had her sippin', call a cab

Times in a room

My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
My rake's in the shed, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe's still missin, like it's greener on the other side.

I take care of the yard, everyday, I don't know why my hoe got missin'.
My rake in good condition, my lawnmower in position.
I ain't done a damn thing wrong for my hoe to get up and get missin'.
Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt and I saw for myself then witness.
Well I'd tell you about my hoe, never had restrictions.
I guess more green was her attention, I shoulda kept that hoe in the kitchen.
Got me on a mission, left my shed without permission.
I'm sheddin' tears messin up my vision, this hoe gon' make me go to prison.

[Chorus]

That hoe cost me my job, I'm afraid I should of learned mo' about the business.
A hoe is good for diggin', I should of know this from the beginnin'.
I don' got caught slippin' now I'm tripping out the door somebody else found interest.
Throw my hoe until I found out until I find out different. Better to know then have intuitions.
Who been in my yard, why would anybody split us apart.
I never thought that hoe would get to my heart, I found out right off this bitch came from a bar?
Why this hoe ain't in somebody garage. I was a gentlemen right from the start.
Ever since I put the hoe in my touch, now this bitch won't even spare me the rod.

[Chorus]

7 years now it's all over, now hold on goin' gotta feel me brah.
Left my home, no sign of luck. I try to drink Patron so all the memories gone.
All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup. Bought the hoe my last couple of bucks.
Lost a hoe I never felt this crush, like cushion a dutch, never this much.
If I would of known my hoe was just temporary.
And I ain't talking about the hoe you find in the dictionary.
I feel like going to war like the military.
Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery.

I can't hate where I'm from
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me, me
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm talking bout roots

Hey I can't be mad at what y'all meet ahead
I don't regret my ghetto struggle due to my success
It ain't that beautiful to write on overcoming stress
Top ramen noodles thank pappy for the fact I was fed
Look at me now but all before hey Mr. skid row
The dirty south ain't just a name the way I've been poor
The projects burnin' white, I call it gizmo
Went from a gun to them cars in a jigga video
Can't find a meal to a mil, only god know it
No record deal to a deal, I work hard for it
Can I live to I'm livin' like my momma told it
Before you rip it, gotta sew it
Yeah

I'm talking' bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me, me
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm talking bout roots

Hey, still on my coupe but can't take
Somebody had to be just to get away
My sister had to leave, I respect her stayin' safe
Oh yea I had to grieve but I'm stronger to this day
Pain, I can't ignore it, you might say I'm ignorant
I'm mistakin' for courage, which victory so gorgeous
Make it through two bush, I can make it through any forest
Hunger gave me the wish, but the bottom is so important
37 Ave and 187 Street, Miami (karat city), now I'm part of a legacy
I'm thankful for the hood, what is love without jealousy
There's only five letters really help me

I'm talking' bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me, me
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm talking bout roots

Hey I know the seeds been planted
It's damaging my soul but my dreams been granted
That triple life towards, much deeper than nurse planet
What could I want more than redoing I never planned it
Gets no lower than a grabbin' on your feet
A man will stand for nothin' if he fall off with the feet
A baller and a hitter all in the street
If you look beneath the sand then we all need a crease
Roots before the branches, roots before mansions
Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson
Roots with your grandparents, roots under your canvas
Roots whether you black, white, or spanish

I'm talking bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me, me
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Luck don't stay nowhere near where I go

Unless you ride that muthafucka
And you be lucky enough to get away in the grave

These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall

They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude

Riding with Weezy fucking Baby

Can't let go i got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless i get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace

Get depressed 'cause the outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality see when your blessed just kill critics
Buggatti never when im rich, just god fearing
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring
Gotta good feeling, plus the right caring, tell his Billie Jeans
I'm on another planet

Waited for this time
Waited for this moment to step into the light
Got this drink up in my cup
One night to live it up
You know I’m not stopping till we've had enough

Perfect brother, can't tell you that I'm at but I'm on the right track
Every time I look back, it's a struggle
No faith I woulda' sat right there, forgot about my friends
Cause I done hustled, no not dope just soap in vanilla envelopes
Check out my demo, oh I'm flo right now, when I go right now
Was it ever that simple, used to roll, get pumped like a Pitbull,
Out the way said I ain't got potential, cake walk guess I ain't get the memo
Ooh take a walk in my shoes, 'cause tonight my dreams they came true
And I'ma party it up through the roof (This is what we're waiting for)

No it's not an option, I'ma yes I can 'til this spaceship land with the Beatles
See the road blocks up and my autograph sucks but the leech is unbelievable
Got the round, but the bucks not wanna get bucked
But, my fist up, rock star sign
Guitars just broke, in my mind
Was packing up, I might get by
Talking bout luck, on my side oh
Take a walk in my shoes
'Cause in like my dreams they came true
And I'm a party it up through the roof ooh (This is what we're waiting for)

And bark to the music, sucker than a psychic

Walk to a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a visit

Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gon' stop, let the good times roll
Come on let’s go, you got another minute
Get the party on the roll, ain’t nothing like the feeling
When you’re winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one love

Pull up in the Chevy so classy and hot, hot
Pockets full and heavy got you screaming what you got, got
What you tryna say, I know I already rock, rock
Gotta let go, pedal to the floor
So incredible, so much better with the flow
Ready for the show, like I'm singing hey yo
Do it like a pro, let the good times roll

Flo Rida,"Yeah, good looking E-Class, I needed that, nigga
What? Trilla, realer to fuck niggas

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

I started flat broke, now I'm poppin' rubber bands
I know I'm the shit, I done ate a ton of spam
If the club poppin', Ima burn a hundred grams
Check the parking lot pimpin', whip cost a hundred grand

I'm in love with shades, I got a thousand pairs
So that's free game for all you thousand airs
It's funny sour D's will smell sweet
All these niggas think they sell them on Canal Street

I'm sittin' twelve feet, fuck, can you tell me
I let the 12's beat, 'Nightmare on Elm Street'
So don't fall asleep 'cause my life a dream
And they ain't gotta speak, they know I'm spittin' cheese

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

We got them bottles poppin' soundin' like they gun shots
Got the models balkin', did it all with one watch
I hit a lot markets, start 'em off with one block
People love the product, so my people come to shop

My uncle, 65, he still sellin' dope
He claim he petrified, the field goin' broke
It's them Caddy Seville's, went from acid to pills
To elaborate deals if you want status you kill

'Cause they have it for real when I step in the spot
Treat the club like the charts, I go straight to the top
They cost a stack, so don't step on the shoes
And ya know I'm strapped, I'ma play by the rules

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

Take the good with the bad, in the club blowin' your last
Ballin' like I violated, bottles keep me hydrated
Party up in skyscrapers, parachute to prevail
Pistol like a paratrooper, tell 'em take it easy

Bitch is bad as can be, this her fantasy
Left her panties at home standin' there thick as can be
Are I see K are O S S, standin' there dressed fresh
Gettin' pussy, hell yes, Ross, Ross

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5

You and I know your love comes once in a lifetime
Love comes once in a lifetime

She was the neighborhood dream girl
Can look, but don't touch, they all wanna know us
If it ain't with me, then it can't be no one
When the groupies came to the show
When the money started to grow
You stayed down, don't play around
Look at this girl we made now
Been around the world and I came right back for your love
Forgive me for the days and nights I was cutting up
Wanted the motions in the ocean and emotions covered up
From flashing lights in the club to magazine covered up
Fly you to Miami and cop you floor seats
And you would always tell me your heart was for me
Way before the models ripped the runway
It was us, drop-tops, speeding down the runway

So let’s go
I want you to know that you're special
I'll never compare you to no one
Baby, 'cause I know that your love comes

But I started looking for more
When they started feeling the flow
Them girls trouble
Come more than a lifetime and time don't wait for no one
I'm out here like I throw ones and they dance for me
My man he warn me how my come-up might just cancel me
Now I gotta go fix that, get that, hit that
He flip that in that like I used to be big D-A-D-D-Y
I'm so special, she can't have another dude that woo her
I got my Bugatti, but that just pickup and move her
That sears these years on lairs get weird
My fear is tears that smears and make-up
Don't ever make up, you better wake up

So let’s go

I'll never compare you to no one

Floater,"That's right my name is Danny Boy and I like to drink at night.
I go down to the pub, wherein I buy myself a pind or three.
I like to go out drinking, 'cause beer it is my life,
Until I come home and lay eyes upon my darling wife.
And they say
Oh Danny, won't you go home earlier tonight?
Your daugher doesn't know you
And your giving us a fright when you say...
Say, something's wrong with anyone who's not lik eme.
With you the violence just comes so easily.
You never learn I have to teach you constantly.
Hush now.
That's right my name is Danny Boy and I'll buy another round.
Then off to the marked when this place closes down.
I say drinking's always done when the sun's up in the sky.
The sun is always up somwhere,
And it's your turn to buy and they say,
Oh, Danny, won't you go home earlier tonight?
Your son he doesn't know you and your giving us a fright when you say
Say, somthing's wrong with anyone who's not like me.
With you the violence just comes so easily.
You never learn I have to teach you constantly.

until you befriended me?
How you've grown...

And I could leave this place,
and I could almost fly...

If I could only just reach the window...
One, two, three, four...
You had sex on television,
watched a clock.

Did you never notice that your life has stopped?
Changing,
think I'm arranging
in some thin little ways.

And you cry...
take me away sister, 
won't you leave me astray sister?
was my taste not as sweet...

as your tongue wanted?
You need me, we're the same.
You need me, we're the same.
You need me, we're the same.

You need...
Yes, it's a shock.
but trust me, you'll feel better after.
I see- I see you must have lost your way,

but I can bring you back again.
Go through the sky again,
breath, open your eyes,
feel your skin grow cold...

I can bring you back again.
Be yourself again.
I was so kind...
Went nearly out of my mind.

But I was thinking of you the whole time.
And I gave you all that was mine.

I gave you all that was mine.

You push hand into flame,
You push hand into the flame and you watch it like a movie.

Burn, watch it burn!
Can you feel something's wrong?
Your body and soul are telling you something.
(They say) time heals all wounds,
But it's up to us to make the new ones,
And we make 'em like this.
Make 'em just like this.

The glory of the dawn...
We may be the few who see.
Some know right from wrong,
But not you or me.

Down deep inside of me there must be worth,
Buried underneath all of the Astro-turf.
But I just can't believe it, and I just keep on singing.
My candle burns at both its ends, and it will not last the night.
For all my foes and all my friends, it sheds a lovely light, like this...

What I've realized since is that it's a very painful process but it is not destructive. It's the road to liberation. The what really happened in the sixties was that this country took just the first step toward admitting that it had been wrong on race, and creativity burst out in all directions.

From the color of the faces in Sunday songs
To the hatred they raised all the youngsters on
Once upon a time in this country, long ago
She knew there was something wrong
Because the song said ""yellow, red, black, and white
Every one precious in the path of Christ""
But what about the daughter
Of the woman cleaning their house?
Wasn't she a child they were singin' about?

And if Jesus loves us, black and white skin
Why didn't her white mother invite them in?
When did it become a room for no blacks to step in?
How did she already know not to ask the question?
Left lasting impressions
At a lesson, comfort's gone
She never thought things would ever change
But she always knew there was something wrong

Always knew there was somethin' wrong.
She always knew there was somethin' wrong

Years later, she found herself
Mississippi bound to help
Stop the legalized lynching of Mr. Willy McGee
But they couldn't stop it
So they thought that they'd talk to the governor about what'd happened
And say, ""We're tired of being used as an excuse to kill black men""
But the cops wouldn't let 'em past
And these women, they struck 'em as uppity
So they hauled 'em all off to jail
And they called in protective custody

Then from her cell
She heard her jailers
Grumblin' about ""outsiders""
When she called 'em out
And said she was from the south, they shouted,
""Why is a nice, Southern lady makin' trouble
For the governor?""
She said, ""I guess I'm not your type of lady
And I guess I'm not your type of Southerner
But before you call me traitor,
Well it's plain as just to say
I was a child in Mississippi
But I'm ashamed of it today""

She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
([spoken] And, all of a sudden, I realized I was on the other side)

Imagine the world that you're standing within
All of your neighbors, they're family-friends
How would you cope facing the fact
The flesh on their hands was tainted with sin?
She faced this every day
People she saw on a regular basis
People she loved, in several cases
People she knew were incredibly racist

It was painful, but she never stopped loving them
Never stopped callin' their names
And she never stopped being a Southern woman
And she never stopped fighting for change
And she saw that her struggle was
in the tradition of ancestors never aware of her 
It continues today:
The soul of a Southerner
born of the other America

She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong
She always knew there was somethin' wrong

What you win in the immediate battles is little compared to the effort you put into it but if you see that as a part of this total movement to build a new world, you know what could be (?????

(Combat to get you to bomb back)

I know how to rip a mic different
I grip it like so
Tight like a kryptonite with a bike pole
Sparks from my lips ignite liquid nitro
No telling if it might blow

The environments' gotta be hotter
Than solder beside the iron
Zinc vitamins
Hide'em inside when I'm writing the rhymes
It's hard to keep property guarded
Because of these pirates

And I motivate
No debate
We're takin' it over
Make no mistake
You're fake and there's no escape
'Cuz you got caught
Frozen waitin' for the crosswalk

I can take it to another level
Where the bass is above the treble
And your face is in double
Evasiveness doesn't settle it
A place and a space
Where theres nothing to meddle with

Lyrical combat to get you to bomb back
Blonde, black, lets get beyond that
Sing songs that attack with strong raps
3 2 1 contact
Sans paddle we swim the long laps
Swans flap to get the pond packed
Want sass kiss my moms ass
Wrong tact convict you en mass
Take it back like Linda Ronstadt
Or Luke Sky with a twisted long hat
Ton ton fat subsisting on that
Tom tom high hat
Insist upon that
Listen to Jon rap
This is combat
To get you to bomb back
Two fisted contact to
Get the pond packed

Echo echo one-nine
Hear the call through fault lines
Smoke signals, old rhymes
Shorted lights in store signs
Spelled in a broken code
Find that it is time to
Breath, build, bend, and refine you

We sky tenants
Give it all but won't give up
Radio soul antennas
Radio to lift spirits
Call sign commando
M.O. is independence
Scream till the walls fall
Dissolve all the limits

Occupied minds
Unemployed skills
Desolation
Worn out
Torn down
Just for now thrill seekers
Slanging
Test tube babies in beakers
Where gun blasts pump straight from the speakers

The system where the
Poor get poorly paid
To hold the ladder
Where the rich get ricocheted
Into the stratosphere
And in between people are rushin' like Vladimir
With medals to make their status clear
Get us out of here

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
We need heroes
Build them
Don't put your fist up
Fill them
Fight with our hopes and our hearts and our hands
We're the architects of our last stand 

There's a war going on for your mind
Those who seek to occupy it will stop at nothing
The battlefield is everywhere
There is no sanctuary
There are no civilians
You have two choices
Surrender or enlist

What kind of person are you
Always the first to argue
Or never down to stick your neck out
'Cause it hurts you far too much
To see your rep suffer
Set you up a buffer
Well neither is enough for us cut from a tougher brand

Of duct tape the propaganda's stuck on us like sock pajamas
Spread like a virus
Through accepted thoughts and proper manners
But off the cameras
Somethings simmering across the land
About to bubble up
And knock the lids off of the pots and pans

We are non stop juggernauts
Stomp ziggurats
Spit manifestos
By terabytes and gigawatts
Shock paradigms
Give sense to a score
Throw thoughts through the sky
Activate twenty more

Expectorate on dogma
Pragmatic sycophants
Divide and conquer
We build bridges offer
Hard work and prosper
As hand made heroes brought to you by no sponsors

Born in the flood
Bloody fingerprint sets
Black marketed fresh
Water canons forget me not
Epitaph airbrush with death
White t's
Wife beaters
Button up
Reattach flesh

In between the lines
Outside of the law
Underneath the veil
We dig our foundations
We navigate the globe
Trying to find a pattern to break the mold
With a family to feed
There's nowhere we wont go
But what if were caught
They say I'm a snitch
Shot at the check point
Found with his throat slit
There's spray paint on the teleprompter
Anchorman screams that hes seen a monster
Mayday
There's bloodstains on his shirt
Mayday
They say that hes gone berserk

Sometimes
When I wanna shut out this world
Wanna rip up this page
Wanna pour out this heart
Wanna get up on this stage
And my lips become percussion
And my fists become the rage
And I pound on this table
Till it gives me something to say
Then I think about things that I've seen
Right in front of me
That I don't wanna believe
Gimme one of these mikes
Lemme let em know
The way that it is is not how its gonna be
Not if we don't let em get ahead of us
The present tensions no threat
Its just a fence across the path
That were already ready to walk
Rock solid footsteps
Let 'em put up obstacles
And prove that it isn't possible
Fuck that
We don't give em any weight
True liberty and freedoms at stake
Peace will never become pass
Live my life until my last day

It was half-past eight in the bat cave
When the cracks in the plaster collapsed
And gave way to gaps in the pavement
Mayday mayday
Put it on blast
For the passengers and messengers
'Cause this is a disaster
Where the fuck are the rescue workers
Not far
Off pissing on a cop car
In the hall with a pop tart
Sipping liquor in the rock bar
Everyone climb to the front line
Lunchtimes canceled
All hands on deck to pull survivors from the landfill
Onlookers passers-by shake off that rubble
Brush off your shoulders
Break free from your standstill

Signs of a better world
Causes we understand
Failures we expected to occur
And bring redemption for our sins
Safety from the crowds
In the shadows on the run
We write our own cider house
Rules to keep alive
Rituals that prove their worth
Search for systems we can trust
Rhythms we can lock into

This is madness salvage teams
Can't bandage
Hope when its damaged
Or broken compassion
Not enough rope in the van when
World is collapsing
Our mode of action
Broadcast through the glass
Its all we can manage
Donate with the plastic
Scraps from the salad
Hoping to balance
Emotions invalidated
And staged on 4:3 aspects
Just ballast for sadness
Lives shattered are standard
Fare for cameras and channels
Stare no abracadabras

No faster answers
Or mantras for disasters
Remastered and plastered
Got it all backwards
Do you know the faction your backing
Its another man down
Another mother gone
Child drowned
Another silenced song
Solitude
Another kind of strong
I miss you
Another strung along
Missing in action
Another page is blackened burned
Turned to ashes to ashes
Dust off the flags and the caskets
We will never find another you
Despite the life of love we knew
These lightning times are trouble who
Cant count the strikes that punished through
The bonds we thought would never break
And never will and never fade and never change
But there is the rage
Of losing you to their mistakes

In between the lines
Signs of a the next movement
Refuge from the crowd
Outside of the law
Causes we understand
Hands that trace
Instructions for descendants in the
Shadows on the run
Underneath the veil
Failures we expected to
Occur and bring redemption for our sins

Whats in your alleyway

Its not equal

Make a new street
Build a new bridge

Say can you see by the dawns early light
Free slaves running
Songs words weren't right
Now a new days coming
The few stay stunning while the many are handsome
Your soul is alive but they want it for ransom
The base drumming is the anthem
We step to the heartbeats of our granddaughters and grandsons
And

Rise together
We rise together

Lost hope and found need
Grounded by our surroundings
Did the walls scream universities
Or you and I verse the tees
React automatic and we burst when squeezed
And make 9-11 each emergency
Urgency amber to red like the turning leaves
Oh please let the hurting cease
Don't let apathy police the populace

Change the sword to words and lift continents

Fears uncontrolled just swoll the tide
Of blood in the streets while the people die
I'ma keep on tryin'
Longs as suffering's multiplyin'
And why not
Souls get tossed and left out to rot
My backs broad enough to help left your cross
As long as you help with mine
The process of healing will take some time
To see the pain on your face is the same as mine
Not a game or a race but the stake is high
We maintain our mistakes for the sake of sides
As long as it takes I""ll say it one more time
As long as it takes I'll say it one more time
As long as it takes I'll say it one more time

[Chorus]

We need money for health-care and public welfare
Free mumia and Leonard peltier
Human needs not corporate greed
Drop the debt and legalize weed
We say yes to grassroots organization
No to neoliberal globalization
Bring the troops back to the USA
And shut down Guantanamo Bay
The same things over again
My throat's so sore from shoutin' no war for the soldiers again
Lookin' for cloud cover when the explosions begin
Lookin' the crowd over wonder if you where we've been
We've been all over the globe Iran to Nicaragua
Guatamala Angola grenada
Dominican republic Haiti chile
It don't stop and it won't stop unless we keep say

Who let'em overthrow Jacobo Arbenz
Who let'em overthrow Mohammad Mosaddeq
Who let'em assassinate Salvador Allende
I didn't let them but they did it anyway
Who let'em overthrow Kwame Nkrumah
Who let'em overthrow Aristide
Who let'em assassinate Oscar Romero
I didn't let'em but they did indeed!

Don't let them assassinate Hugo Chavez
Don't let them assassinate Evo Morales

Flobots,"Stand up
We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

Stand up
We shall not be moved
Except by a woman dying from a loss of food
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

We still don't understand thunder and lightning
Flashback to when we didn't fund the dam
Didn't fund the damn levee
No wonder man
Now our whole damn cities torn us under man
Underwater but we still don't understand
We see hurricane spills overrun the land
Through gaps you couldn't fill with a hundred tons of sand
No we still don't understand
We've seen planes in the windows of buildings
Crumbled in
We've seen flames sending chills through London
And we've sent planes to kill them
And some of them are children
But still we crumble under buildin'
Underfunded but we still don't understand
Under God but we kill like the son of Sam
But if you feel like I feel about the son of man
We will overcome

Stand up
We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

I said put your hands up and I'll copy you
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
Except by a woman dying from a loss of food
Except by a freedom fighter bleeding on the cross for you

We shall not be moved
Except by a system that's rotting through
Neglecting the victims and ordering the cops to shoot
High treason now we need to prosecute

So stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
And we wont fight a war over fossil fuel
Times like this that you want to plot a coup
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

Stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
Unless we are taking a route we have not pursued
So if you've got a dream and a lot to do
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
I said put your hands up and I'll copy you
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
If you've got a dream and a lot to do
Put your hands up

Now shake, shake a Polaroid dream
Nightmare negatives develop on the screen
We sit back and wait on the government team
Criticize they but who the f**k are we
The people want peace
But the leaders want war
Neighbors don't speak peak through the front door
House representatives preach stay the course
Its time for a leap of faith
Once more
Put your hands up high if you haven't imagined
Hope that the pen strokes higher than the cannon
Balls to the wall nose to the grindstone
My interrogation techniques leave ya mind blown
Places your bets lets peak to the enemy
Don't let them pretend that we seek blood
And whose we anyway kimosabai
Mighty warlord want to be street thug
A threat for a threat leaves the whole world terrified
Blow for blow never settles the score
Word for word its time to be clarified
We the people did not want war!

So stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

Stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
Unless we are taking a route we have not pursued
So if you've got a dream and a lot to do

Hammer the battle cry into braille studded armor

Do not remain neutral
Do not rely on this broadcast, alone

Scoped for greener pastures
But you never have scored

Met someone who made me glow
Passion was like crazy whoah
Doted on another though
So of course I let her go

Oh no my adrenal recipe's
Overloaded by phenylalanine
If it keeps on misdirecting me
Fuck it that's gonna mean vasectomy

And when the liquor pours it's
Set the table get the door
Wrestle naked hit the floor
But I don't seek that shit no more

It's different for me
Try to tell myself a different story
This alpha male recount-the-tale bullshit can just destroy me

'Cause what we say is what we seek
What we seek is what we get
What we get is what we give
I can't give you nothing yet

Except

Take these words and turn them into lies
Serve me up with food that does not feed
Satiate my every last desire

He collects clips from magazines
Found them full of hollow points
Mixes Medea with the media
They both consume the young

He wants to hang
So he gets hung
He's chasing father figures
A real son of a gun

I don't cotton to the coffin nails
Caught up quiet don't make bail
Umpteen years for move'n keys
Ironic he's locked up in jail

Outside he is idolized
My sister's class and ask the boys
They wanna just be like him and move more rocks than belts of asteroids

Better strapped and paranoid
Than in the streets without a choice
Peace of mind has been destroyed
But now he's got a louder voice

Idols lie to idle minds
Sayin' I don't mind if I got mine
If all our lies are idealized
Then all our crimes are idolized

If this isn't love why does my heart hurt so bad?

You don't know why
You wanna be the man
You wanna be demanded
By other people's hands so high
You're caught up in its leaves
Make the audience freeze at the thought
But you don't know why
You wanna beat a man
You wanna be demanded
By other people hands so high

For nice things and pipe dreams that my enemies could be blasted by

When gladiators
Breathe their last

When the dreams do clash

Call us weak

They claim the arc's Bartholomew's

We'd rather make our children White Flag Warriors

Core-to-core
Were the ones
We've been waiting for
We hold steady
Steadier than stevedores
Not tevias or matadors
On matters of what came before
Forgive the debts
To settle scores
Test the mettle
Either ore
Whats your plan got to do with me
If the bell tolls let freedom ring
And find new ways if we must be King
Instead of leading the young to our suffering

We pass testaments down scream back at heaven
For testing us like Wednesdays at eleven
Wanna recruit and train us to act evilly?
Save it for the shooting range and smack DVDs
Won't study war no more this millennium
It's never again to me or anyone
So think harder when you refer to us
Rather make our children martyrs than murderers

They shell dwellings to quell the shelling
They lift taboos to seduce the cowards
They say we're too yellow-bellied
But we say we're the new superpower

We seek waivers to not be liable
We claim to speak for a higher truth
We stand opposed to the homicidal
We tell you you're fireproof",White Flag Warrior

In vision, imagine this, I be wishin' that everybody would listen 
Kissing ass until I was able to step into the arena,
Make an impression and lesson and discovering
I out-smarted mathematicians, blazed through expeditions,
Through conditions not envisioned by those who pass predictions
In addition got a mission, a vision, if you would listen
Produce collaboration increasing complications

I see you wonderin' why you hear my name again (uh)

And if we fail again then love will conquer pain again

Your mind is made on obeyin' opinions
From acquaintances who's situation suggest loneliness
I try to leave but you protest
Professin' you love me

But can't show me lovin'
You want out but you keep me in
Patience runs thin as you go through your motions
I cry oceans, tears become orphans

As my soul leaves its apartment
I get migraines, heart strains
Tear stains an' fear gains
With increases in the pain, yo, I get a headache

I get a headache
Said, I get a headache
Baby, I get a headache
Said, I get a headache

I need to lie down
I need to lie down
I need my lipstick
Listen, I need, yo, it's, it's too loud
It's, it's too loud

Play it soft, turn the music down
Yo, could someone turn the music down?
It's too loud, it's hurtin' my head, please
Please, yo, please, turn the music down

Play it soft, turn the music down
Yo, I've got a headache
Just turn the music down",Headache
Floetry,"This is memory lane, hello
November eleven 1998 (hello) and I met this guy
Man what's up I'm cool (oh)
This spirit this soul (oh)
He had this voice and his complexion and God those eyebrows 
I felt them before I ever touched him 
It was so
You're beautiful you got me singin' shades of amazin' rain
Plain and simply
You got me lovin' everything about you (thinkin' 'bout you)
First sight and I'm dazed I'm going crazy constantly thinkin'
If I should take a chance, should I take a chance and call you

Just to say hello, how are you, what you up to
Nothin' I'm cool she's fine, alright, that's true,
Who me, not u, 
She said, what you do
You crazy, for real though, 
Can I...let you know

Who me, not u, 
She said, what you do
You crazy, for real though, 
Can I...let you know

I'm mesmerized, you got me doin' things I wouldn't usually do
To get next to somebody I was into 
And I'm into you babe into you babe
Last night we met I feel I've known you forever
And I would like to know that we can get it together
So I will call you yeah

Just to say hello, how are u, what you up to, 
Nothin', I'm cool, she's fine, alright, that's true,

Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know

You know your existence 
Has kinda been recognized 
By the resistance to dream
Eventually becoming a way of life to me
Enough to keep contentment 
Through waking hours to courting shades
In those early days
Math was exchanged 
I kinda had to build up the courage to just say
Hey, hello, remember me (hello) 
I just felt, just to say
How are u..how are you babe hello
how are you babe how are you babe hello
How are you babe how are you babe hello
How are you babe how are you babe hello
How are you babe how are you babe hello",Hello
Floetry,"Remember how you used to ummm, you used to phone up and (ohh) 
You wouldn't say your name you, you'd just say Hey You

You know I see you on my blank sheet before I write or form oracle this situation yo, 
My memories choke me and stain my
Pillow as my voice becomes hollow as I trace tear lines around this space 
That won't fill yo I feel nothing but this way and
The emptiness stays and its cluttered with a silence that teases me 
It leads me on like it's gonna say, like it's gonna say

[Chorus] 
Hey You, I'm Sorry that I have to leave I'll try to come back ohh, 
Hey You I'm sorry that I have to leave I'll try to come back one day

You know yesterday I stood outside in the rain in an attempt to dissolve away 
Or just disappear or be gone be back or be
Just I try to see the point but I only see the pain 
My dreams cry when they're slain I regain consciousness to blurry vision
I try to listen out for whispers of

Hey You, I'm sorry that I have to leave I'll try to come back oohhh,
Hey You I'm sorry that I have to leave I'll try to come back one day

Rain Drops disguise my tears have gone
I want you to be here with me to stand by me
Said I can't help but to be selfish baby cause I don't want to be alone

[Chorus]

Did I leave you behind or did you let me go
All I know is you're not here to say to me those special words (Hey You) 
Time was once on our side but now it's against us It parts us and we're not always (saints?)

[Chorus]",Hey You
Floetry,"Sometimes blindness finds me
And leads me through ignorance
Not allowing us to gain experience
So we become lifeless
At other times I cover with 
Self pity or work aimlessly 
Through reality so
Occasionally I choose to travel alone
But never fulfill my possibility so
Mostly I attempt to achieve balance
By seeking right knowledge and loving 
And reviewing and eventually overstanding those
Many lessons of my life

You got me caught in 
A stormy odd world that drains
And I beg to see truth and promises 
You made to me
Now we've come so far 
But my visions of happiness 
With you in my life 
I'm afraid and confused
If I was a bird I'd fly

[Chorus]
If I was a bird I'd fly away
Spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky
I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

If I was a bird I'd fly away
Spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky
I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Now why do I feel so alone
Knowing I know I have you
And what made you turn around on me
What did I do
and when did love feel this way
So much pain and misery
Where's the you I once knew
And could ya fly with me

[Chorus: Repeat x2]

Now I can't stay
You won't need me
Set me free and let me fly 
Oh fly with me
Fly with me me
Fly with me yeah
Fly oh fly fly

[Chorus: Repeat x2]

Fly away

If I were the sky 
I'd let it rain to wash the pain

The time was right.
The vibe was right.
Ready to get into you all night
I wasn't really into puttin' up a fight
I let you do your thing and your thing was tight.
Funny as it seems I had a ball with you
Wanted to eventually step all with you
I'm caught up in the middle of the desert sea
But still I let you get the best of me, best of me

I never really wanted to be with you 
Said,I'm just tryna be honest
I didn't even care for the things that you do
Said, I'm just tryin' a be honest.

One weekend undercover under moon and stars
You killin' me, killin' me' from here to mars

Wanted to eventually be all with you
Caught up in the middle of the desert sea.

And as I know that said I'm worried 'bout the things we do
See, Mr. Messed Up, I've been here before
With another brother that I would have died for

Floetry,"It's better that it hurts, 
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable 
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

Said I'm concerned that I feel this pain 
My heart is aching, breaking, pain staking in this gambling thing 
This ain't no parallel universe, parallel life 
You choose to in one your living like love of my life 
And in the other your the daddy of theirs 
So I play Russian Roulette and put this phone to my ear 
Just to say, yo this is Ms. Stress

It's better that it hurts, 
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable 
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

See too much asked of me through his lips 
So I attempted to be all that dreams suggest to the ego and promise the soul 
I tried to be all he had ever told of the interchangeable face 
And physicality and mentality of she as closely ? 
He summoned all my tears abandoned we 
I lived alone for years, no longer knowing who exactly is me 
As I began the punishment for his perfection 
My vision nearly lost the direction 
My return to innocence was lost and his ID 
You see I forgot instead I saw protection through judgment 
Now angels and devils look alike to me 
Sometimes quiet sounds like lonely to me

My angel I stopped breathing for you 
If my life was possible without end to be sure 
If love I'm needing more than just a casual affair  
But the pain runs deep internally 
But clearly seen when your not there

It's better that it hurts, 
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable 
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

It's better that it hurts, 
It's better that it feels this way to me
I can't be too comfortable 
'Cause loving you is not my destiny

Yo, yo, yo it ain't my time to die right now 
You to I means death of my heart my visions my dreams

Floetry,"Listen uh I met this guy and uh you know 
I don't get down like that 
But we were together for a while 
And you know things
Didn't work out but I can't be mad 
With him you know 
'cause we had some moments 
Yo I'll explain listen

We wrote fairy tales of how we'll live in castles 
Tight like Hansel and Gretal 
And grow old and settle in a town that we'll
Tighten with our marry day we got a love 
Like that like everyday like every way 
I cannot stay at yours tonight 
We can hold tight love bite 
And share some soul we can pick and roll 
Lose control and let me
Take it like how I let you break it don't forget 
We can get high on each other 
Insert a time for it through the night and
Back into the morning can't crack the habit 
You see I'm feening I'm needing some more 
And you got me grinning like it's
Money that I'm winning No way is this ending 
'cause you got me feeling purer than thou 
Show me how you do this thing cause
You got me singing like, yo, for real

He had me singing like some kinda opera shit 
I don't know where we went with it, 
It was like, I used to turn to him
And just whisper in his ear cause yo, 
I made him promises like I'd say ummm

I'll crown you king of this throne 
If you can take me home like run with no stripes 
Doesn't have to be tonight how's about
Early morning I'm talking AM we can beat the dawning 
Or just chill few time barriers can't help the whispers of I do but you
See through my proper test got me making game faces in London 
We say lacing you making sense this shit's intense I kinda
'cause you move me so I broke my role 
And got freaky with it You try to stave me 
With my own belt I ain't gonna lie I felt
The universe move you left me singing 
Like Opera like Cleopatra or Madam Butterfly 
You this shit's so good it brought tears
To my eyes I was like

I'm telling you man it's no lie I was like
I just yo, I, I couldn't even ignore parts of me I was like grabbing on him
And We were happy for a minute for true Opera We'd be like yo yo yo

Was that suppossed to happen all that foot tappin' 
Voice breakin' now I'm carving 
Karma Sutra diagrams with the headboard
Ignored the buzzer 4 times got up hard 
Telling lies even surprised myslef 
With my conniving ways I doved in like he meant
Survival like he was christened H20 
Like he could make the trees grow and the clouds spit snow 
He laid kisses on my chest
Like his name was Zorro got me saying 
Hell No when he said he had to go I was hiding clothes 
And play fighting with children
We were clashing Titans till weight 
We were losing I had Slum Village album on repeat 
We were knockin' boots to hip hop
Beats I even reached my maximum in my sleep 
Yo he had me singing like

Yo, for real I'm not lying listen up 
It was like I'm gonna break it down the truth is I got goose pimples now just
Thinking about that shit yo, Just his voice 
If I could hear his voice right now I'd answer the phone like, you know
What I mean yo listen if I knew where he was right now I'd find him 
We split We split ways we went about you know we went
About our business I want to know if he's making somebody else hit that 
Opera you know 'cause I ain't had gonna that in a
Minute it's like",Opera

We don't recognize our dreams inside

We're not aware of exactly
What's real ya know we walk around day dreaming But the sunshine, the sunshine always is, and I

I just want to see my lovely sunshine(Sunshine)
I just want to bring back all of my blue skies
And if you take away my rainbow I will cry(cry)
Give me back my sunshine

Dreaming my state of being and I see you smiling You're so happy just laughing and standing strong I'm missing you right here 
Listen to my tears I'm waking up to skies so gray
Needing you to brighten up my day

Okay listen catch your breath cool out 
You need to calm down (that's right)
Concentrate don't go making all your time run out
See your okay it looks much worse than it really is,
And you'll pull through come on you know how we be doing this
It's me and you yo, you promised you can't pull out now,
We're friends for life so you can't just sell me out 
We shared a lot but you know we'll see just so much more
Our wedding day and the children that we prayed for

I used to depend on your rides to show me the way that I should go 
My reality is blurry I'm afraid of being all alone
Your light has been my guide throughout the good and bad 
I wish that I had spent a little more attention to my one and only sunshine

Listen, I'd never leave you yo, 
I swore on my grave
Damn what's that I'm feeling dizzy 
Kinda getting faint
But it ain't nothing 
Didn't sleep that much last night
From watching over you but none less I'm cool I'm fine
I said I'm feeling fine 
So back up off me I'm alright
I'm here to see my friends 
And what's up with that blinding light
Said I don't need to lie down 
I don't need your help right now 
What's up with all the noises all the running round
You've got it wrong I'm not the one 
Who needs the help in here
Yo, what's up with you, 
You're crying I see tears
Yo, what's going on don't leave 
Please don't take her out
Said I don't understand 
I'm kinda feeling scared now
I said it's getting hard to breathe 
Getting hard to see
I'm not too sure anymore what's going on with me
Please bring her back connect me 
Talk just one more time 
But it's too late the last exhale is mine

Floetry,"Yo, do you feel clever?
No, forget what everyone else has to say
Do you feel clever?

Subliminally, subliminal
Subliminally, subliminal
Subliminally

It's like, I live in whatever like is
Always raining, similar, never the same
See the game don't play that, so I speak maybes and if onlys
Instead of I ams and fallen memories

All that don't feel to good to be
But my genealogy registers adaptability and that bitch
Feels like it's fixed
'Cause my great grandmother spoke of this exact same thing

I use rhyme but I think she used to sing
Or just bring her force to a circle of women
And they be aligning chakrias and meditating
Bad vibe vaccinating, evil energy eliminating
As well as debating on how to raise the children and love the men

But today we're more caught up in Ricki Lakes and Jerry Springer
Becoming Numb, now that's the title of my narrative base, novel of fiction
But still my fascination is loyal to how we manage to stay, we, human
A once civilized nation, or so they told me, yo

Just seeing how we fight to be
Instill it in your sight to be
It's subliminal, subliminally
Subliminal, subliminally

Just seeing how we fight to be
Instill it in your sight to be
It's subliminal, subliminally
Subliminal, subliminally

You see, breast was a blessing so I owe no shit
Obligation is a choice, but this choice I select
Who to share my love with, love me and be in
'Cause I believe that I am leaving with most are submerged in

It's a messed up situation
So stay stationed is the advice that I leave
To those who can't come to those you won't proceed
You can stay right here

And if you ever pass go, do not collect 200, I repeat do not collect
So I'm this disputing being openly happy
When it serves so well to be depressed

Any attempt of smiling needs impeccable timing
Make the suit sweet by allowing them to feel
That they suited the situation to the masses, to the market
Keep them pushing Beemers

My friend I may not be able to deliver a Benz to you
But I can give you piece of mind
Piece of mine

Define ownership, now will your mothership take with it
What you purchased at your outlet
So my friend once again I'll just give you piece of mind

Just seeing how we fight to be
Instill it in your sight to see
It's subliminal, subliminally
It's subliminal, subliminally

Just seeing how we fight to be
Instill it in your sight to see
It's subliminal, subliminally
It's subliminal, subliminally

As my voice becomes hollow

As I trace tear lines around this space that won't fill, yo
I feel nothing but this way and the emptiness stays
And it's cluttered with a silence that teases me
It leads me on like it's gonna say, like it's gonna say

Hey you, sorry that I have to leave, I'll try to come back, ooh
Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave, I'll try to come back one day

You know yesterday I, I stood outside in the rain
In an attempt to dissolve away or just disappear or be gone
Be back or be just, I try to see the point but I only see the pain
You know, my dreams cry when they're slain
I regain consciousness to blurry vision
I try to listen out for whispers of

Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave, I'll try to come back, ooh
Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave, I'll try to come back one day

Rain drops disguise my tears have gone

Said I can't help but to be selfish, baby

Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave, I'll try to come back, ooh
Hey you, I'm sorry that I have to leave, I'll try to come back one day

Did I leave you behind or did you let me go?
All I know is you're not here to say to me those special words

Floetry,"Sometimes blindness finds me and leads me through ignorance
Not allowing us to gain experience so we become lifeless
At other times I cover with self pity or work aimlessly through reality
So occasionally I choose to travel alone

But never fulfill my possibility
So mostly I attempt to achieve balance
By seeking right knowledge and loving and reviewing
And eventually over standing those many lessons of my life

You got me caught in a stormy eyed world that drains
And I beg to see truth and promises you made to me
Now we've come so far but my visions of happiness
With you in my life I'm afraid and confused
If I was a bird I'd fly

If I was a bird I'd fly away, spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain
If I was a bird I'd fly away, spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Now why do I feel so alone knowing I know I have you
And what made you turn around on me what did I do?
And when did love feel this way so much pain and misery
Where's the you I once knew and could you fly with me?

If I was a bird I'd fly away, spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain
If I was a bird I'd fly away, spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Now I can't stay, you won't need me
Set me free and let me fly
Oh fly with me, fly with me me
Fly with me, yeah, fly, oh fly, fly

If I was a bird I'd fly away, spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain
If I was a bird I'd fly away, spread my wings so I'd escape
If I was the sky I'd let it rain to wash away the pain

Floetry,"We wrote fairy tales
Of how we'll live in castles
Tight like Hansel and Gretel
And grow old and settle

In a town that we'll tighten
With our marry day
We gonna love like that
Like everyday like every way

Like can I stay at yours tonight?
We can hold tight, love bite
And share some soul
We can pick and roll

Lose control and let me take it
Like how I let you break it
Don't forget we could

Get high on each other
And serve time for it
Through the night and back
Into the morning, can't crack the habit

So, you see I'm feeling
I'm needing some more
And you got me grinning like it's
Money that I'm winning

No way is this ending
'Cause you got me feeling purer than thou
You need to show me how you do this thing
'Cause you got me singing like

I'll crown you king of this throne
If you can take me home
Like runs with no stripes
It doesn't have to be tonight

How's about early morning, I'm talking AM
We can beat the dawn
Or just chill through time barriers
Can't help the whispers of I do

But you see through my proper test
Got me making game faces
In London we say lacing you say making sense
This shit's intense ya, I kinda ? offense

'Cause you move me
So I broke my role and I got freaky with it
You chastise me with my own belt
I ain't gonna lie, I felt the universe move

You left me singing like opera
Like Cleopatra or Madam Butterfly
Yo it feels so good you brought tears
To my eyes I was like

Now, was that supposed to happen
All that foot tappin' voice breakin'
Now I'm carving Kamasutra diagrams, y'all
With the headboard

Ignored the buzzer four times
Got up hard telling lies
Even surprised myself
With my conniving ways

I dived in like he meant survival
Like he was christened H-two-O
Like he could make the trees grow
And the clouds spit snow

He laid kisses on my chest
Like his name was Zorro
Had me saying, ""Hell No""
When he said he had to go

I was hiding clothes
And play fighting like children
We were clashing our Titans
Till weight we were losing

I had Slum Village album on repeat
We were knockin' boots to hip hop beats
I even reached my maximum in my sleep
Yo, he had me singing like

Yo, he had me, he had me
He had me like, he had me like",Opera [Live]

You've got it wrong, I'm not the one who needs the help in here
Yo, what's up with you, you're crying, I see tears
Yo, what's going on, don't leave, please don't take her out
Said I don't understand, I'm kinda feelin' scared now
I said it's gettin' hard to breathe, gettin' hard to see
I'm not too sure anymore what's going on with me

Just a little focus, coulda broke this
Woulda woke this, shoulda choked this
Had I chose bliss I?d have left this infatuation

Far behind, I?ll exchange my mind
No more wasting time, this process is mine
In your eyes, my reflection is blind
In your arms I decide, this is our last night

I have to leave you
So long for you and I

Always asking for never noticing
Every move I make, this game?s reacting in
Perfect symmetry, I'm my destiny, must invest in me
Or I'm just gonna be victim of circumstance

All is left to chance, how can I enhance?
I'm afraid to dance
I must break this trance, 'cause it?s deafening
So I'm breathing in, I'm breathing in, I'm breathing in

Breath to get control of me
I have to be

If I stay right here I?ll die inside
Ran out of tears, I can barely get by
It?s fair to say that we tried
You know I wanna stay, if I do I?ll die
I?ll die, I?ll die, I?ll die, I?ll die

what's the use in living here yeah
If I don't feel alive forenied mistakes
So much I've done, so much to cry
I cry, I got to

If I stay right here I?ll die inside
Ran out of tears, I can barely get by
It?s fair to say that we tried
You know I wanna stay, if I do I?ll die
I?ll die, I?ll die, I?ll die, I?ll die

This aint worth it,
You gotta know by now,
I got have intentions,
But I got a temper,

Something peculiar,

Something singular, 
When really it's about the we. 
You've been thinking,
I've been thinking,
But we should be talking.
Our hearts apart are coming to their own assumptions.
They're still in love and,
We need to need to know that,
There's nothing else to prove.
Why you hesitate,
About debating on the real?
Why you acting like,
I'm not your friend,
I'm just your girl.
Why you tryna keep on hiding what I know you feel.
Why you wanna fight alone?
You know I know the deal.
You're in need of,

Floetry,"Karma usually comes wearing the stranger's light
It's easier to deal with that way
But now it's you, I've hurt you, disrespected you
There's nowhere to hide, no turning back, no rearrangement
Only what lies ahead and you're so Heaven sent

I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby

I'm sorry for giving you the cold shoulder
Never been this wrong before
Never stood my ground and breathed it in before
All I wanted to do is hold ya
Never felt so brave and so afraid before
Never faced alone and felt the peace before

With tears in my eyes I come to you sincerely
Excepting this space I'm in
Growing outta the phase where I just wanna win
You act as though you don't even hear me
Look at me baby look at me I know you

I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby

Growth I released my grief it was a heavy load
Survived the sleep and now I'm letting go
Waking up and living up to what I had proposed
Woman now I love the girl I used to be
Ever step she took was reaching out to me
Every breath is blessed responsibility, we made it baby

I can't control your feelings, feel me
I can't take back, what I've done
With my hand on my heart
I'm coming to you sincerely if you hear me I know you

I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
I love you, I love you, think about it baby

I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through
'Cause I love you, I love you, think about it baby

Baby think about it we know better
But love has no expectations
So I don't expect you to do anything
Think about it

It's a pretty day let's go outside and enjoy it

My man said heaven is a day away
If in the present you loving in a braver way
I wear the aura of a king and dream of a love supreme
As a child I was told that my love is king

Seeing what it can bring to the lives of those
That ain't afraid to give with their souls exposed, golden rose
You color my reality with balladry allowing me to
Me to love like a child that's free, I'm proud to be your superstar

My love is honest and true and I can prove it babe
My love is everything to you if you choose it babe

You know I liked him so much that it turned into loving
Then the love back to like now I feel like I'm bursting
More nurse than my name 'em so full of potential
He stands tall I feel it's internal

Fine like the earth and the sea and the sky
Together we make stars we are truly fly
I wanna paint him take a picture of his soul
His story should be told

See he's like everything I dreamed of
But better than the preview
Now everything he working on
Has got me saying me too

Like he food that I need, blood 'cause he bleed
He real 'cause I see, it's all meant to be
Remember how to make believe
Yo these brothers are your enemy

You're in a state of disbelief
Without your heart you'll never be
So sister's sing along with me
Because your love is true

I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar
I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar

My love is honest is true and I can prove it babe
Prove it babe I can prove my love to you

Flogging Molly,"Whistles the wind, blowing my way
Sweeping me back, back here to stay
Can winners be losers running on the same track?
Some head for glory, others refresh

Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
The beauty in life, where's your God?
And somebody told me, you were doing okay
Somehow I guess they were wrong

My isolation, now there's a sobering thought
A minute alone, a lifetime too long
See the face in this mirror, so pale it could crack
Desperately wanting a color in lacks

Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
The beauty in life, where's your God?
And somebody told me, you were doing okay
Somehow I guess they were wrong

So you drank with the lost souls for too many years
Time to be right cause they'll cripple with fear
Never been righteous, go sell them, we're wrong
Life's only life with you in this song

Now there's an ocean between us
Where I am and where I want to be
So you prayers in doubt, doubt not for me

Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
The beauty in life, where's your God?
And somebody told me, you were doing okay
Somehow I guess they were wrong

Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
The beauty in life, where's your God?
And somebody told me, you were doing okay
Somehow I guess they were wrong

Flogging Molly,"Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Five hundred years like Gelignite
Have blown us all to hell
What savior rests while on his cross we die
While forgotten freedom burns
Has the Shepard led his lambs astray
To the bigot and the gun

Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

I watch and stare as Rosin's eyes
Turn a darker shade of red
And the bullet with this sniper lie
In their bloody gutless cell
Must we starve on crumbs from long ago
Through bars these men made steel
Is it a great or little thing we fought
Knelt the conscience blessed to kill

Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

Ah, but maybe it's the way you were taught
Or maybe it's the way we fought
But a smile never grins without tears to begin
For each kiss is a cry we all lost
Though there is nothing left to gain
But for the banshee that stole the grave
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

I sit in and dwell on faces past
Like memories seem to fade
No color left but black and white
And soon will all turn grey
But may these shadows rise to walk again
With lessons truly learnt
When the blossom flowers in each our hearts
Shall beat a new found flame

Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

'Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies, singin' drunken lullabies",Drunken Lullabies [Acoustic]
Flogging Molly,"Wipe the blood from your lip
With the flesh of your hand
Theres no thorn in the side left to grow
So lets cherish the names that we lost for an age
With the rue now the supper must go
Where traditions they blend lives a home on the mend
The grass glistens now for alls eyes
So lets sever the shame we have come to reclaim
With the waters retreat feel the shore for us
Woth the red rose pales lay a thousand graves many more
Where the ghost still haunt for the day we come to the fore

[Chorus]
Don't look back
For whats dead now is safe
The exiled, a home where the soul kept safe
Take me back on the crest of a wave
No more tears for you paddy's lament
No more tears
No more paddy's
Lament

Rip the greet from his heart
Theres no sorrow tonight
For once banished dreams sleep divine
Where the silence you hear is the prosper we shared
The only blade is a razor sharp smile
Still the church bell rings the collective sings that still roam
But the only thing left is the pain of nothing once more

[Chorus]

Grab the leaf of the branch from the tree in the ground
Where the roots claimed the earth many tioled
To a land that now stands under no-ones command
And her beauty let no man destroy
So remember the gun and the damage it's done
The last drop as been spilled for you and I
Let there be no despair for the rule we once shared
Brush the tear from the eye that still shines

Where the red rose pales lay a thousand graves many more
Where the ghost still haunt for the day we come to the fore

No more paddy's

Flogging Molly,"I spent twenty seven years in this factory
And the boss man says you're not what we need
The penguins in the suits they know nothing but greed
It's a solitary life when you have mouths to feed
But who cares about us

Now I'm back on the streets with my hands held shut
I'm a working man without any work
Well is this the way it's meant to be
Because I signed off of the American Dream
Now, I write my name to the welfare sheet
The money in the bank, well it's history

So take me down to where the worlds collide
Need to be here 'till I'm satisfied
So let the revolution begin

Now I drag these bones cross the barren land
Where once a city now an outstretched hand
We can't lose our sense of dignity
While the fat faced cats they'll fuck the creed
Another disappearing act fouls up the sleep
While the church is on our back see the refugee

So take me down to where the worlds collide
I need to be here 'till I'm satisfied
There'll come a day when all of us will show
We all feel free!
Although we crash, and we will burn
Let the revolution
The revolution begin

I spent twenty seven years in this factory
Now the boss man says you're not what we need
The penguins in the suits they know nothing but greed
It's a solitary life when you have mouths to feed

So take me down to where the worlds collide
Need to be here when I'm satisfied

So take me down to where the worlds divide
And you'll be here
I won't compromise

There'll come a day when all of us will show
We'll all feel free
'Cause from the ashes we will grow!
So let

Begin, begin, begin, begin!",Revolution
Flogging Molly,"God you say is always the answer
But what is the answer for our cruelty
We punish a life 'til it's life ever after
Ever after the place that we all end up being

O' such is a morn' as this to awaken
Forgotten the hour that was yesterday
With a standing blow to the head of frustration
Divided we fall have you nothing to say?

So let us rise up
Stand and be counted, stand and be counted
On that let's agree
Rise up
Dig out the cancer; dig out the cancer of futility

Many's the word that's been broken true anger
Lips that are sealed as the hour slips away
Belief is a joke to this lost generation
Building the walls as the mind segregates

But when all is said
The voice that is silent can't be heard

So let us rise up
Stand and be counted, stand and be counted
On that let's agree
Rise up
Dig out the cancer; dig out the cancer of futility

For we, we shall overcome, someday

So we bring the head of the ol' palace tribe
For there is the rapture that bleeds out a life
Hand over fist from their pulpit they spew
Liars they'll crumble not knowing the truth

But when all is said
The voice that is silent can't be heard

So let us rise up
Stand and be counted, stand and be counted
On that let's agree
Let us rise up
Dig out the cancer; dig out the cancer of futility
Rise up
Stand and be counted, stand and be counted
On that let's agree
Let us rise up
Dig out the cancer; dig out the cancer of all human greed

And it better happen today 
Cause all the shit I see 
There's got to be another way 
We need some positive changes 
There's been enough for the worst 
You losers better watch your back 
Because we're taking out the drunks first 
When temptation, pressure come along 
Just remember we're thousands strong 
I've always been sincere, 
For the scene is what I live 
Get the fuck out, 
If you have nothing positive to give 
We need the kids who don't use that crutch 
Put down that beer, is it asking too much?

I learned I don't need drugs 
I learned to say no

It never gets done 
You blame it on us 
When you know you're the one 
If you're here to put us down 
Then you better fucking look around

Won't be torn apart by the words you spoke 
We've been here for far too long 
And what we built is way too strong",Deep Inside

This positive youth will always remain",Always
Floorpunch,"I won't apologize for my actions 
When I did what I thought was right 
You got what you deserved 
The only answer was a fight 

You brought it upon yourself 
I did not ask for any of this

What did you think would be my reaction",The Answer

Will show my feelings, what I was taught to believe
I won't erase the past, I've got nothing to hide
I hope these times will last because I'm enjoying the ride

I'll always be the one to tell you how I feel
You might not like honesty, but at least I'm fucking real
You say you know my story, but you haven't got a clue
It's time to hear the facts, separate the lies from the truth
Twist around my words, don't listen to what I say
You don't know the deal, you're so quick to judge my ways
These stories have to end, so the truth can be heard
I can only trust my friends, and that's the final word

And never hearing 'The who live at Leeds'

Talk of tomorrow, or spoil the gathering

You fill my reservoir with shame
And resignation to banality that fills your little mind
