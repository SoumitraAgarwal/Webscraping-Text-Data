Eric Reyes Cedar,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile [Webster-Mandel]
Eric Rigler,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Eric Rigler,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Eric Roberson,"In your eyes I see questions
Has your faith drifted lately
Wondering if in your hands you see this
Here's my heart offered to you
Hope you don't worry that 
You will not be able to hold on
Don't change for me, no
Don't change for me

Eric Roberson,"How does is feel to finally be free?
I wonder will I ever know
Sometimes I dream of how that can be
To have a life that I own

When you look at me, what do you see?
Do you understand my story?
All I want is love, someone else to see
If you took the time I have a song

For so, so long I've been searching
For something that we’re probably not meant to find
But no matter how hard it gets
No matter if the tears fall
Nothing should stop us from trying

When you look at me, what do you see?
Do you understand my story?
All I want is love, someone else to see
If you took the time I have a song

When you look at me, what do you see?
Do you understand my story?
All I want is love, someone else to see
If you took the time I have a song

When you look at me, what do you see?
Do you understand my story?
All I want is love, someone else to see
If you took the time I have a song

When you look at me, what do you see?
Do you understand my story?
All I want is love, someone else to see
If you took the time I have a song

Eric Roberson,"Back in the day, before there was love
Before there was us, before I knew what
It really meant to have me somebody
Who's really there giving there all for me

Back in the day, I didn't know none
Before we was one, I learned on the run
What it would take to keep our hearts happy
Straight to the end, can't let this chance pass me

Baby, we made mistakes
But I see just what it takes
The last thing I want us to make
Is steps that we'll take us far from our fate

Girl, how can something so clear
Just push back something so near
Now I don't want to be cause of your tears
Your worries, your fears should all disappear, baby

There's no need to worry
Just that I am ready
Even when I'm away my heart
Stands right back here with you

Whenever you call, girl
My heart reaches back for you
No matter how far away
My heart runs right back to you

Back in the day I would have just ran
But now here I stand, I'm making these plans
What's in a day if you're not my future?
Why give these words if they do not move ya?

I wanna just build, I wanna just heal
Those negative feels when out on the field
Most of my boys think that I've gone crazy
'Cause since I met you, none of these girls faze me

Baby, it's you I hold, lately it's hard to let go
It's crazy even when I know
That I just have to go, I can't pull to the door

I know it has to be love, you fell down from up above
As if you came down here just for me
To somehow help me see how heaven can be

There's no need to worry
Just that I am ready
Even when I'm away my heart
Stands right back here with you

Whenever you call, girl
My heart reaches back for you
No matter how far away
My heart runs right back to you

More ever more
You will find so much love [Incomprehensible] in me
I've learned to love
Take your time so that you can see
You can trust in me

So baby, won't you lay back?
My lady, won't you relax?
I got you, take care of that
Your front to your back
Your sides and all that

All that is mine
What comes to mind
Put those behind
Love your design
[Incomprehensible] rewind

There's no need to worry
Just that I am ready
Even when I'm away my heart
Stands right back here with you

Whenever you call, girl
My heart reaches back for you
No matter how far away
My heart runs right back to you

There's no need to worry
Just that I am ready
Even when I'm away my heart
Stands right back here with you

Whenever you call, girl
My heart reaches back for you
No matter how far away
My heart runs right back to you, girl

",Right Back to Me
Eric Roberson,"She ought to know by now that the love I have is real
She ought to know by now everything I say I feel
She ought to know by now there's no secrets to conceal
She ought to know by now

Pulled out my heart and rang out all the love
Gave it to her but it was not enough
Went back to see if I left some behind
Hoping that one more drop will make you mine

She ought to know by now that the love I have is real
She ought to know by now everything I say I feel
She ought to know by now there's no secrets to conceal
She ought to know by now

I'm out here knockin' but she won't let me in
Just keeps on stoppin' before we can begin
But once I'm in she will see how good love can be
But right now her past is clouding her views of me

She ought to know by now that the love I have is real
She ought to know by now everything I say I feel
She ought to know by now there's no secrets, no, no secrets
She ought to know by now

Want to show I love her so

I gave her kiss she said she needed more
I got in my car and went straight to the store
I spent all my dollars and took a part a rose
For every step ya take I drop these on your toes

She shook her head so I wrote a letter
Hoping that my words would come across better
But still no reply, least not the one I hoped
She just closed out her eyes and let out these notes

So I just stood there scratchin' my head, hey
Prolly when I should have been listening instead
Wanted to know her wishes not just her fears
Just want her to know, know that I'm here

She ought to know by now that the love I have is real
She ought to know by now everything I say I feel
She ought to know by now there's no secrets to conceal
She ought to know by now

Oh, she ought to know by now there's no love that's not real
She ought to know by now everything I say is real
Hey, she ought to know by now there's no secret to conceal
And I'm done 'cause she should know by now

You ought to know I need you, you ought to know I care
In your love I believe in, my heart is yours to have
Now just know I'm here, you ought to know I'm yours
There's no need to fear, no need to be unsure

You ought to know to trust me you ought to know I'm honest
So have some understanding let the truth be your promise
I know I have a love I know I have a friend
But do we know each other? We won't know till the end

You ought to know by now
You ought to know by now
You ought to know by now
You ought to know by now

Eric Roberson,"I just kissed the softest lips that god has ever made
And I am so in love with the girl to whom these lips he gave

Never thought that when I would close my eyes
That I would be in for such a lovely surprise

And I just could not resist from falling, falling, falling

Eric Roberson,"Iluvu2much to let you hurt me again
Though leaving you is like walking in the wind
I can't return or turn around
Or let this wall I build come down

For you at least I love me
Too much to not find peace
That peace of me I carried it
Out when I gave you my love
(When I gave you my love)
(When I gave you my love)
(When I gave you my love)

Too much to not find peace
That peace of me I carried it out
When I gave you my love
(When I gave you my love)
(When I gave you my love)
(When I gave you my love)

Every second is getting harder
Moving further from the one thing
That I though I needed
But I'm tired of the waiting around
For what I truly feel I deserve
(When I gave you my love)

But you never told me one word
(When I gave you my love)
That would make me feel loved
(When I gave you my love)

I just wanted to give up babe, ooh ooh
When I gave you my ooh
When I gave you my ooh ooh ooh ooh

Eric Roberson,"Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

Why must the bad things always feel so good
Why can't I just stay away
Thought our situation was understood, still does not mean its okay

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

Why cant these memories just be erased
Why must I yearn for your kiss
The first moment we're not face to face
Reminds me how much your missed
Where do we go

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

When the morning comes
When it's time for us to go our separate ways
When this night is done, I be wanting to hold onto you
Oh the sun, I wish we could push it all away
'Cause then we'll know that we can show what we have from the day

Where do we go from here (I need to know, I need to know)
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

I need to know where do we go oh
I know I should walk away something keeps telling me one mo day
Maybe if I'm patience then one day it would change yeah

Eric Roberson,"I can’t believe girl who we are
How we’ve grown so far apart
I wish I would of known it just from the start
That your heart I will lose
Now I look back I should of known
My actions would of been two nights alone
Even bringing new girls on my home
It feels wrong
That’s not true
And it never will
Be able to confess
Who I’m loving, how I feel
Everything I miss
Starting with the words
I love you all and on your lips
Every little kiss
Wish I should regret it
But I’m just feeling this
About the time we had
Wish I could have it back
I wish we had a choice of who we love
I wish I had a choice of who I was dreaming of
Cause I wake with up on my mind
Bad we didn’t fall in love at the same time",At the Same Time
Eric Roberson,"Girl, you are picture perfect
A perfect picture in my eyes
Girl, you are picture perfect
A perfect picture, yes you are

I couldn’t draw you better baby
You are so define,
I guess God took his time
When he came up with your design
I couldn’t draw you better baby
Words just can’t describe
How you look under these stars tonight
Blessin' to my eyes

Girl, you are picture perfect
A perfect picture in my eyes
Girl, you are picture perfect
A perfect picture, yes you are

I couldn’t draw you better baby
Just holding your hand gives me
Satisfaction similar to when two lovers dance
Couldn't draw you better baby
Neck was made for me to kiss on
All my songs have seem to run on
If I write about you!

Girl, you are picture perfect
A perfect picture yes you are
Girl, you are picture perfect
A perfect picture, yes you are

I couldn’t draw you better baby
Look into your eyes I see

Brush strokes, got her callin my name
I ain't formally trained, I'm just drawing from experience
Worth more than millions, holler if you're feeling it
Real love that takes care of all of your needs
So beautiful you fall to your knees
In an instant like it was a Rembrandt or a Matisse
Cause it's nothing like the new freedom of two beings
Being in love, you see 'em
Holding hands broad daylight 2pm
Perfect portrait that's worthy of a museum
I can't call it, conclusion I can't draw it
Can't understand why so many still heartless
Trying to find imperfections in the Mona Lisa
Even if you find one baby, it's still flawless

Eric Roberson,"So sorry she know so well,
It was a tale her mom used to tell
Now I saw her mom love a man
Thought it was a part of a plan
But the cycle can continue
The cycle can continue

Thinking I'm psycho,
For thinking a cycle can't continue
Or perhaps she, from a female's perspective
Can relate more intricately,
Before I've been through
Emphasize with your minstrel
Cycle, but the cycle can't be tamed
Like a bite chain, pops to the train
Stops to the brain,
Ops out the cycle to evolve
When the rain stops we watch the pain dissolve
Now we're letting it continue to the next

Generation of men courting women with the text

Eric Shifrin,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

I'd be rich as Rockefeller

Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Eric Shifrin,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Eric Shifrin,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do?

Into my life you came

Can take a kiss without regret

Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams

Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time

Has given me a wonderful idea

You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

There once lived a lovely charmer,
Swimming in the Rhine,

They called her Lorelei.
She created quite a stir,
And I want to be like her!

I want to be like the gal on the river
Who sang her songs to the ships passing by,
She had the goods and how she could deliver,

With lots of ""hey, ho-de-ho, hi-de-hi!"",

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Eric Warren,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Eric Watson,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,

You took my love and now you're gone

I guess I'll never be the same

Eric Winstone,"Diamonds are forever, they are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever

No silver spoon in my hand 
No trumpet blew 
No bells rang out in the land 
Nobody said life would be easy 
Nobody promised me an island in the sun 
For all my life 
I've walked as tall as I can 
Among the crowd 
A small invisible man 
I wasn't born to be a hero 
I have to make the dream become reality 
I know that somewhere there must be 
A golden key 

And/Give me a reason to believe 
There is freedom in the air 
And it's easier to be/breathe 
A golden key 
That will open any door 
And the truth that lies within 
Is no secret anymore 
I fill my shoes 
And walk wherever they go 
A man of straw 
For every wind that may blow 
I have to take control of my life 
I want the world to see 
A different side of me 
Unlock these chains and set me free 
A golden key 

To a castle in the air 
And a heaven here on earth 
Will be waiting for me there 
A golden key 
To the place I want to be 
On an island in the sun 
And the hero would be me

One taste of paradise 
Is all there has to be 
Is all there has to be

And a heaven here on earth 
Will be waiting for me there

I was amazed
And as I sail to the end of the world
I'm not afraid
Mournful moon and willow tree
Tell the world not to weep for me
And I will be set free
I took a drink from a bottle of wine
And I was changed
Made a deal with the devil inside
And I was shamed
I have sailed on stormy seas
Where the four winds blow me

Shining moon and willow tree
Tell the world--remember me
For I will be set free
All that we see
All that we seem
Is but a shadow of a shadow
Of a dream within a dream;
But if a tree is evergreen,
Then maybe part of us
Could be eternal
Though tangled life
May be no more

A drop rain upon the ocean
Grain of sand upon the shore
The words will live forevermore
If you can hear me now
Am I immortal?
Magic mood and willow tree
If they ask about me
Tell the truth, and they might learn;
Light a candle and watch it burn
Then I will be set free
Free as a bird
Upon the wind

Now all the trials and tribulations
Of the world don't mean a thing
Above the clouds
I'll fly away
Was it my imagination
Did the stars come out to play?
Beyond the sun
Eternal flame
I hear a chorus of a million voices
Calling out my name

But all I see and all I seem
Is but a shadow of a shadow
Of a dream within a dream
Free as the wind
Lighter than ai
Free from the jealous minds
The scornful, bitter words
Won't hurt me there
And I will live forevermore
If you remember me

Nothing can change my mind

This time the dream can't wait another minute
Won't let the clouds get in my way
This time I'm gonna take it to the limit
Make tomorrow more than just another day

I'm ready to take the chance
So let the dice fall where they may
I'm wise to the promises, secrets and lies

And say that the future seems bright

Won't let the clouds get in my way
This time I'm gonna take it to the limit

Make my excuses
And pay my respects

And stumble along the way

Can He hear me when I pray?
I begged of Him and pleaded
Not to let it end this way

As they dance across the heaven, as only they can
A warm summer rain, as it falls from the sky
And a sweet, sweet little birdy, is just learning how to fly

You amaze me daily
I see your personal touch, on the things you love so much
So let me be the first to say

And peace will follow.
Peace be with you always,

That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Erich Kunzel,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Erich Kunzel,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Warmed by a glow of insolvency,
Up to your necks in security.

I cannot go out and steal for you,
I cannot die like Camille for you.

How can love survive?
You millionaires with financial affairs 
Are too busy for simple pleasure.
When you are poor it is toujours l'amour,
For l'amour all the poor have leisure!

Caught in our gold plated chains are we,
Lost in our wealthy domains are we,
Trapped by our capital gains are we,
But we'll keep romance alive.

Erich Kunzel,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee
Her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair
I even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel
But her penitence is real
She's always late for everything
Except for every meal
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf
Maria makes me laugh

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find a word that means Maria?
A flibbertijibbet! 
A will-o'-the wisp! 
A clown!

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather
She's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild!
She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel!
She's a girl!

Erich Kunzel,"You dear attractive dewy-eyed idealist,
Today you have to learn to be a realist.

You may be bent on doing deed of daring due,
But up against a shark, what can a herring do?

Be wise, compromise.
Compromise, and be wise!
Let them think you're on their side, be noncommittal.
I will not bow my head to the men I despise!
You won't have to bow your head to stoop a little.
Why not learn to put your faith and your reliance,
On an obvious and simple fact of science?

A crazy planet full of crazy people,
Is somersaulting all around the sky.
And every time it turns another somersault,
Another day goes by.
And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it.
No, you can't stop it even if you tried.
So, I'm not going to worry,
No, I'm not going to worry,
Every time I see another day go by.

While somersaulting at a cockeyed angle,
We make a cockeyed circle 'round the sun.
And when we circle back to where we started from,
Another year has run.

And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it,
If the earth wants to roll around the sun.
You're a fool if you worry.
You're a fool if you worry,
Over anything but little number one.

That's you!
That's I!
And I!
And me!
That all absorbing character.
That fascinating creature.
That super special feature,
Me!

So every star on every whirling planet,
And every constellation in the sky,
Revolves around the center of the universe,
That lovely thing called, I.

And there's no way to stop it.
No, there's no way to stop it,
And I know, though I cannot tell you why (sigh).

To the trees.

Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.

Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride [From the DeVil and Daniel Webster]
Erich Kunzel,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody

They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long

I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star

Can you believe it, even Stevie Wonder couldn't see it
I'm catchin wreck so beat it
Yo I contour my lines, to freak a funky rhyme
to fit you like a pair of Calvin Kleins
Mad brother with distinction, keep the girls blinkin
and have the homeboys thinkin
I'm the man of hour, of the hour
I found He-Man, jacked him for his power (gimme that)
Now I carry a sword, attached by a live cord
Oh my lord!

like the Brady Bunch, and we all smoke the blunts
(Word em up now) I get raw, raw like a fish market
Mics I spark it, with the funky target
You must trust me, and stop tryin to bug me
with the one-two, before I rush you and crush you
I'm on a mission, like a church group called Commission
Word-gifted, keep the crowd uplifted (yea yea)
E Double, a nigga standin tall

Enough lyrical food to keep the Ethiopians fed

from the K.D. Posse, two of my homegirls
When I rock the mic and get freaky and nasty
People in the industry seldom ask me
Whassup, whassup, whassup
wit you E, ask Eddie Murphy (yea yea)

Cause I'm past that, I'm reachin for Mars, so

Freakin it, with the ill vocal tone
Outspoken, here's a token of my appreciation
I bring drama like Jason
Who can see me?  You better ask Superman
for his super vision, cause I'm on a fuckin mission
Test my skills, and I rearrange your fuckin grill
Will kill if I have to get ill
Get away, carry on, and step

Why?  I'm like the Michael Jackson of rap

I flex, punk and get funky for the occasion
Superstitious, so I kill black cats and all that
and buck em down with the gat
E Double in the house don't you know me
What's up homey loc, step and you get smoked
I have a dream like Martin Luther King
that one day, yo, I can do away
with the pitiful, and the critical wack MC's
separate the ocean, and throw em in between
Grab my nuts, hold em, becaues they're golden
with more wins than Hulk Hogan

And gettin wicked, and let Wilson Pickett
Before I break, let me announce - get the bozack
Now we all can bounce, as I'm hittin' switches

so I can fly high like Mike and ""Just Do It""
And get freaky-deaky on the real, grab the steel
in case there's caps to peel
In the mix, when I flex the context, beware
like when you're havin safe sex
I continue to get brand new, one two

I push your head through the cracks of sanity
and leave your brain doin a bid in purgatory
It's ninety-six degrees in the shade

and gets open dope and stupid bumblin rumblin tracks
When I rap my jams be packed like a laundromat
My context'll wreck your whole concept
Cause my delivery is so complex
And I'm inter-galactic on plastic

It's the hype yo

Word, pulled up brake, ehh, by the front door
Parlay, and I stepped out hardcore
I tipped the boy park the car in the front
Not the back, in case I have to run and get my strap
I walked inside, somebody sing, ""Errrick Serrrmon""
That's me, got me in free
Looked around the club, man no half-steppin
Walked straight up, to the V.I.P. section
Sat by the wall, so I can see what's happenin
My boys spread out, got their girls, and rappin
Oh no, I see a girl comin towards me
Posse deep, so I paused for the cause G
She approached me, hi, told me her name
I told her my name, then kicked the game
Sat beside me, like Little Miss Tuffet (hello)
Talkin bullshit, knowin I want to fuck it
Basically, I figured she was widdit
So I pulled out my ink pen and exchanged the phone digits
Gimme a call when you get to your crib
So I can get directions, right to where you live
She smiled, and left, the girl was wide open
I'm no jokin, when the E blows the smoke in
Check the Rolex, asked for my check
The waitress came over in a pair of black spandex (whoo!)
Gave me a look like, ""Aren't you Erick Sermon?""
""Yes, and who is it concernin?""  Me, that's the hype

It's the hype

I asked her, ""What time you get off?""  ""Oh, in 15 minutes""
So I stormed the bitch like a blizzard
""Umm, can I take you home?""  ""Sure meet me in the parking lot
I'll flash my high beams, so you can find my spot""
She came out - MAN, she was all that
Cool like that, and stacked like that
She jumped in with a wide open grin
Before I went to her crib, I dropped off my best friend
Got to his house, and gave him dap
He knew what time it was, so he passed me a jim hat
Got to her house, then parked the Jeep
I asked her who was home she said her sister but she sleep
Walked upstairs, right into the room
with one skylight lookin straight at the moon (yep yep)
She wasted no time, man she was on it
Grabbed for the bozack, and her hands was packed
Took off our clothes, went to work, man trust me
I heard someone knockin, somebody tried to bust me
It was her sister, man I must be buggin (ahh shit!)
It's the same girl, I met from the night clubbers
""That's your sister?  Oh I didn't know -- I'll go""
and they both screamed, ""Hell no!""
They smiled, with a devilish grin
and the other sister jumped in

I flip more vowels than Pat Sajak's white bitch 

I'm bad ask Michael Jackson's dad about E-Double 

The mack fram, the black superman made of steel 

The mic I'm holdin' is a Samson 

E-D the Green Eyed Bandit in raw fashion 

I'm lettin' niggaz know my territory 

My ground is rugged. I kill a million niggaz so fuck it! 

Nick knack paddy whack give a dog a bone 

Once again it's on with the brand new song, yeah boy! 



[Chorus] 



[Kam] 

God damn, not Kam! 

But I'm afraid so, I lay low like a brick 

Quick to make a cameo, so hand me your eardrum 'cause here comes the 411 

Little devils don't go to heaven, 187 on a saltine cracker 

Smack a, paranoid busta so don't make me have to act a fool 

What's up? Now you can determine 

The West Coast niggaz is down with Erick Sermon on the G tip 

We trips hard on the opposition 

Three niggaz on a mission so listen to the Ill Shit 

'cause we'll get wrecked! 

What you expect! Fuck a rain nigga take a chin check! 



[Chorus] 



[Ice Cube] 

Well here I go again, throwin' up the W 

Ice Cube and I'm down wit' E-Double crew 

Pullin' up in my homie's black 6-4 

Hittin' switches but mine's a convertible 

Matched to the West side, still got the 2-2 

'cause some niggaz don't believe in a gang truce 

Personal shit what is this??? EPMD, goin' out of business? 

God damnit! Can't leave my dog stranded...the green eyed bandit 

Picked up Kam cause my nigga need a ride. Fuck a peace treaty 

But still have the 4-5...glock cocked for the clown 

Yeah we down pulled up and echoed sound 

Don't ya know that we can drop 10 of these, dope tracks 

So fuck all our enemies! 



[Chorus]",The Ill Shit
Erick Sermon,"[Erick Sermon]
Aooowwwwwwwwwwwww!
Part one, the mastermind begins upon a quest
Gettin stupid -- shootin rhymes like arrows shot by Cupid
Ahh, you so crazy, is what somebody told me
You can't hold me, so why you actin bold G?
Come correct when you steppin dude, don't get rude
or I might blast you durin my interlude
But for real though, I'm doper than chronic
A million dollar man, but I'm not bionic
Erick Sermon, a name you know so don't front kid
E.D., rock the mic and roll the blunt, ya dig?
Goal is to get Naughty by Nature
And blow up like when girls blow up my SkyPager
Make loot by the stacks - so when I come back 
through my neighborhood, they see I'm doin good
I got my hat to the back, my hands down below
So act like you know

Chorus: Erick Sermon (repeat 2X)

Imma gitz mine, you go and get yours (3X)
Imma gitz mine, you got it!

[Erick Sermon]
Part two, show the way I flip the funk lyric
and get ghost - with the magical form of spirit
I do my thing, I don't dare front or flake
I commence to earthquake, dominate, and cremate
Abuse and use a funky form of dialect
when I mic check, I freak the ill concept like
skip to my loo my darling, I hear someone calling
Hey, Erick Sermon, yes yes y'alling
I got funk by the ounce to make you bounce
to the bus stop, and flash back to the wop
Now I got the +Vibeology+, in a funky way
Somethin Paula Abdul would say
My style Development, should be Arrested
Arrested Development, _Everyday People_
from my heritage kickin, E's on a mission
It's a black thing kid, and not the Blonde Ambition
Mackaframa, fly mack-dose
Got props from North South, East and the West coast
Like Michael Jackson boy, just _Leave Me Alone_
Cause once again it's on

Chorus

[Erick Sermon]
(Worrrd) One two, as I speak upon the funk
Why is that when the ?, the people told the junk
Man, we can't have anything
Why can't we all just get along like my man Rodney King
I'm a young man, doin what I have to
Who asked you?  I'm doin what I gotta do
I'm guaranteed to have my own show, like Arsenio
if I maintain to be a desperado
Stayin wicked when I kick it through your speaker
You might think I'm a alien, but that's a corny ?
Because my ways are, ""Strange -- and I like it""
and got power like a psychic
I'm +Cool Like Dat+ when I react with the rap
but if you ain't down with it then get the bozack

Chorus",Imma Gitz Mine
Erick Sermon,"Hey young world, one two, one two
Check it out y'all
Uh, Shadz of Lingo in the house
E Double's in the house with Def Squad
On the funky fresh track with Shadz of Lingo

Mic check one two, yo you got my nerves jumpin' around
And ""Humpin' Around"" like Bobby Brown across town
I ain't with that, so don't cramp my style
Step off me, I'm hyped like I had a pound of coffee
Yo how could you ask what I'm doin'
When I'm pursuin', gettin' funky with my crew and
My input brings vibes unknown like E.T.
Makes me phone home to my family
Cling, hello mom, I'm doin' it, freakin' more fame
Than Batman played by Michael Keaton
I crossed over, let me name someone that's black
With fame, and pockets that are fat
Hey, Erick Sermon, he's one
Packs a gun, that's bigger than Malcolm's
Out the window, I look for a punk to get stupid
So I can shoot his ass like Cupid

Yo I pack much dick, with the cover made of steel hoe
Yes yes, never fessed or settled for less
One clown stepped, and got a hole in the fuckin' chest
From the A.K., somebody scream mayday!
Took the sucker out, cause he clowned me on a payday
The funk is flowin' to the maximum
From the E Double, while I kick the facts to them
Check a chill brother with class, rough enough
To run up and snatch the spine out a niggas ass
Grip the steel when caps peeled, here to chill on the real
And don't give a motherfuck how you feel
Thinkin' you're steppin' to this, I kinda doubt it
Ain't with the bullshit, so you can write a fuckin' book about it
The big nigga with the bud and I'm on that
E kick the beat and yo you shoulda known that

Every now and then, I get a little crazy
Every now and then, I get a little crazy
Every now and then, I get a little crazy
Every now and then, I get a little crazy

Yo it's the Lingo of the Shadz
Droppin that mellow but mad mackadocious
Melodious metaphorical music with mo' shit
That you used to, and stylin that you ain't
What else I got to do but draw the pictures with paints?
Oh no, there's my mic squeakin'
A soundman's body turnin' up every weekend
Some think I done the killin', you know I can't remember
I can't recall a full week since this past December
And mics catchin' fire 'fore I get the chance to touch em

Yo yo  I pause for the cause 
I seen niggaz heads busted  someone pass the gauze 
This rhyme may affect the skull to a point 
And crash the membrane, so you should spark a joint 
There I go and now it's Showtime without 
KiKi Shepherd, now the bitch feels neglected 
Check the memo, remember you listened to my demo; 
Yeah the one about the fuckin limo? 
Rewind because I'm pushed for time right now 
What where when how, my sound's out there like Moscow 
I hear nuttin but the music, raw fusion 
No mass confusion or illusion 
Blink blink, blink so what you sayin? I'm not playin 
Hey man, yo I caught you playin 
So don't be conspicous, cause you can't get with this 
Hardcore scientifical, far from typical 
My rap style, is dy-no-might 
It make you want to be like the E Double, and not like Mike 
Yo, bust my acoustics, SWING! 
Deranged, when I rock the mic I feel strange 
Now back to our program, fuck Batman, bang bang 
Sound from the gat-man

So Joe Sinistr came through the armed recruit to blank crews 
My six will fix another one greedy 
For real, let's peel they hats back for deal slow 
And we'll catch clown, with they pants down real low
The screwball better work a RuPaul and switch fast 
Or we'll be in the cornfield, killin your bitch ass 
And Timb's roam through bad bad odor but it is home 
Wild flex and more sex than Mad Cobra 
So take it easy ?just to mash a kraut? mine's the cheesiest 
And I'm sworn to keep their eyes on more than CBS 
I make the Funk Doobie turn to a process 
I mob just any nigga, I don't care who he 
I still get doughs, takin off bitches Girbauds 
And lamp with Erick, a champ merit cause I flip foes 
See these screws loose, I repeat, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice 
But stop there goes the third time with the cock-a-roach 
And I get more flows than Vic Tayback 
So kids, here come the second big payback 

It's the second payback, payback part II

But I'ma chill and let Joe get wreck

The funk dog as I come low to piss on hydrants 
And howl at half moons and White Owls and mad tunes 
Live quite fowl, leavin Lifestyles in bitches bathrooms 
I crack granite, and pack a mass transit it's so weird 
My style is more Fear-ed than Black Planets 
And I fuck your shit, suck my dick for explicit 
I let clips at your name, pay rent in your brain 
And I gets wicked, wick-wick-wicked 
And keeps a full clip in case the bullets get evicted 
And now to twirl up the fat nigga, seek psychiatric 
I devour worlds and Galactus 
I gets mean troop, grabbin Christine around the block 
At sixteen, spittin the green pea soup 
And cock nines, when niggaz got slime, the only men

safe sex
word 'em up

okay, it's time for some action
a little passion, some booty waxin'
for the bozac, make sure he's strapped
and if baby got back, then yo, we with that
call up a few people on the phone
yo we're havin' a party, at my private home
some bring some chronic, plus some brew
call up your girl and invite her too
come active and bring purple lactives
'cause we're gonna get more busy than gymnastics
and do the humpty hump all night
so when you come with the boy, make sure you're right
it's nine o'clock, party starts at ten
so enough for now, I'll talk to you then
later, huh, I'll see you when you get here
and make it quick, ah yeah
time for some safe sex

[Chorus]
safe sex
safe sex
safe sex
we all need (safe sex)


ding dong, there goes the bell
I opened up the door and oh, what the hell
it was a buncha niggas standin' by my door
I said come in, but respect my floor
that means take off your shoes and englands
'cause I'm a gentleman, some say distinguished
all of y'all put your things up in the kitchen
and the rest of y'all sit down and listen
be free and relax in what you're wearin'
let's all be happy like Bobby McFerrin
and get loose and produce the funky juice
and let's swing this shit like they swing a forty deuce
they want some reggae, like some flex
time to have sex
and it's all night, so turn off the light
and let's get high as a kite
and have safe sex

somebody say sex (sex)
say safe sex (safe sex)
I love it (I love it)
I need it (I need it)

but for real, when you're havin' sex
no matter what type, make sure you wear the latex
to all of the cons out there sexin'
stop and look, boy, you're stressed out protection
cause aids is real and something to believe
or not make-believe and fake like hair weave
a death wish like Charles Bronson

about the sex

Erick Sermon,"I.

It's on breaker 1, 2 mike checkin' 
flexin no half steppin 
when I release the funky weapon 
like Ricochet ping ping ping. 
I make fans fell it even when I sing. 
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes 
I'm blowing up like Tom Berringer in Platoon. 
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp 
whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black 
who ain't down with the format 
when you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks 
that's wack 
you trippin you better wake up and smell the coffee 
and then back up off me 
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in 
and then compare them equal boy you must be buggin 
you lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in 
from the Smith and Wessons. 
Change the out look 
change the cover of the book 
you hip hop crook and give back what you took. 
It's the Funk coming at cha 
so don't let the crossover catch ya. 
Boy stay real. 

II.

It's on again yeah about the fake hip hop trends 
for those who can't comprehend just ask your friends 
they know the real deal of rap music no frontin 
you can't be talking loud and saying nothing 
you must be true to the game you understand 
and if not I could kill you man 
for being false plus extra fake on the tape 
talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake. 
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous cause 
I've been here since strictly business 
the era of Eric and Rakim, Biz, Public Enemy, Run-DMC, 
Houdini, The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, LL 
when he was rockin bells. 
Sucker which fake emcee is rearranging the structure band
the motherf--ker. And don't let this happen again 
cause rap could be gone the wind. 
So stay real.

Yes I'm back Black for those who might be confused 
and lost and don't want to pay the cost 
of me hardcore style type a human being 
on the microphone when I be emceeing. 
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it 
how do I know cause MTV shows it. 
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
and catching nothing but speed knots the bumbadots 
I insist we veto all fake emcees and want to be's 
that's worst than the AIDS disease. 
So wake up Spike Lee Joint 
and don't be a knucklehead and get to the point 
with the Funk and pump up the volume 
make the wild tune to make the party boom

So come get a whip, and a bump, it's rough 
Crews couldn't hold it in handcuffs 
The ordeal is that I'm raw ill on the mic 
Switchin my styles up like a transvestite (word) 
I think of competition as (?) and 
Keith Murray is the vocabulary champ 
Come in against deep notable to breach lines
I'll make you make the same mistake twice three or four times 
And nobody got a style like this 
You could say, I got my thinking cap on backwards 
I'll demolish the retarded smartest rap artists 
Regardless, tryin to scream the hardest 
I fuck your head up like amphetamines with L.O.D. 
Then bend you out of shape like a master Yogi 
I put my head through your chest, just to see 
Who's next in line, just to get wrecked 
I makes contact, bust the interlude 
I take my skills to another level like Qualudes 
And you couldn't hear me out; cause the type of shit 
I converse about'll drag your brain in the slaughterhouse

Rip the shit to pieces, so leave me alone 
Check me out, the way I freak the mode 
The active half flippin shit so split 'fore I explode - BOOM! 
So umm, pay attention, before I put you and your crew on suspension 
For being closed minded to my invention 
Yo, I rock on reel when I record oh my lord 
The world full of jackers so I keep my shit stored 
When I rock the microphone I rock it right 
And keep it hardcore and more blacker than Wesley Snipes

Stick tissue up my nose to stop the snot from makin spots 
To be or not I still give niggaz polka dots for plots 
Now Richard Dawson had a survey sayin that I was awesome 
Throw on your Walkmans while I pour the funk sauce in your coffins 
WAKE UP! While the blunt's laced up just to pick the pace up 
My style's freaky, nasty like Seka pussy papers 
When I raped her, you don't know check the four-uno-uno you know

Now right about now I'm settin off a bomb to blow the Empire to ashes

Verse 1:
I gets the urge to let loose on shit, bringin' the vibe like Phife Dog and
Q-TIp
Midnight black darkness, it's the area or place that's destincive enought to
trace
The bass, my tune throughout the room, and if you want it, it's here to
consume
Now let's warm things up for instance a witness, as I break it down up in
this sentence
He, who shall not follow the funk shall fall, on they face
Not able to dip di in the place, my style is vintage, doper than any wine
on the market
Mics I spark it, flying tracks is my target, (def squad) I handles my
situation
Without Lyrics form Jason's, I still get's ill, beeotch
Even from the jealosy I receive, you can't hold me back I won't retreat
I'm determined to be the nicest creation since devices
Or Italian ices, no matter what the problem is, I still, ah 1-2, in your
face like I'm Biz

Hook:
Boy meets world ""I want to know of you, I want to know of you.""
I want to know if you feel me though (X8)

Verse 2:
I believe in the power of the conscience mind
And if you think something then it becomes something like
If I had to battle a whole crew, if I couldn't beat them
Then my conscience would defeat them, yeah
I wouldn't put my career in jeopardy, but I will let something off if these
people keep stressing me
This is madness, I wish I was around when that midnight train to Georgia
picked up Gladis
Listen close life is just what you make of it, if you want to Be Happy like
Mary J.
Then hey,  then get rid of negativity in your circumference
Or outside your realm in mass abundance 
Knowing that the industry is fulling up with drama got some hype (fakness
from people of all types)
Even the so-called keepin' it real type stars are frauds, get the sword

Outro:
And the question is asked. Who is the fake nigga? Who is the fake brother
that is always fuckin' up your shit. You want to know how a niggas fake?
Check it out. Sit back and you focus your shit from a general perspective,

Scared to get out the car
While I keep it real like Buckwild and Star baby pah

Yup, my name rings bells (bells)

Turn my mic up some.. turn my mic up some..
Turn my mic, check check, check, turn my mic up some
Almighty, uhh..

[Verse One]
Lord forgive me now
This be the best way I know how, to get this out
I can't sing so I have to bounce
Even though, that's not what my style's about
I hate this world, sometimes it gets me
when family and friends are not friendly
I just don't get it - so I sit home
in the bassment lights low on the mic and spit it
They plot, to get my scratch
Not knowin the time to get where I'm at now
In my face, like I owe 'em somethin
Handout from me, and never did nuttin (word up)
They're mad at me, like I changed
It's hard on me Lord, it's wreckin my brain
Is it me? I know it can't be
So I ask you, please help me, now

[Chorus: R. Kelly - *sampled*]
Sometimes I laugh, tryin to keep from cryin
If I was plain out of luck, then tell me who could I trust
See I work so hard, just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God, I'd probably be dead

[Verse Two]
Uhh, I laugh when ain't nuttin funny
Meanwhile cats want to count my money
Plan on me, to get jumped or somethin
Plot-ting like E's punk or somethin
Feels so strange, how I maintain
to last in the game, throughout my fame
I'm focused man, the E stay the same
Hate when folks call me out my name
Damn Lord, heal my body
Cause I'm mad enough to kill somebody
Even hard to trust my lady
Did she lock me down to have my baby?
I know she love me - damn it's nuttin
The world's so corrupt, it got me buggin
Uhh, I want to move away like (?)
why'all feel me - yo, R. Kelly

[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Huh, yo, huh
The game changed, damn I should quit
Can't get respect, without havin a hit
Someone somewhere talkin shit
Got fake cats in my clique
But I deal with the cards that's dealt
Try to make music that's heartfelt
Still doin eighty on the Belt'
In the Escalade, with Dolce shades
I've been paid, now what's left?
I guess, should I stress life or death (huh?)
Sometimes I want to end it all
Live at peace, with 'Pac and Smalls
Can't do that, got fam at the crib
My moms, my pops, my girl and my kids (uh-huh)
.. open my eyes
So I ask you, please help me, now

[LL Cool J]
Uhh, uhh.. yeah
See I know how to get down, word up

It's so hot it's, LL's version of the East coast chronic
Smoke 'til your lungs collapse
You supposed to be the nigga, where all the drama at?
So ironic, L came back
Flooded the market - got your mens on the wall
holdin his blunt, too fucked up to spark it
Show me a nigga who can do like I do
Then gas your mans up so I can rip that nigga too
Braggin you goin platinum like that shit brand new
I was platinum in eighty-five, what THE FUCK wrong with you, huh?
Come (?) L - what you call rocks to me is minerals
Tried to throw salt on my name, shit's political
The baddest man on the planet
So ill when I'm spittin niggaz take it for granted
Cram to understand it, I'll switch and write it lefthanded
Heat my pinky ring up and leave your bitch branded
Got a voice like a cannon - nigga shoot
I don't think she really hot, your career is a fluke
I'm the best MC to ever touch the pen
Take a look at what I'm doin it will not be done again
As sure I am the descendant of former slaves
I'ma resurrect brothers from they mental graves
Make 'em confess - LL's the most rugged
God, and no man's above it, gotta love it

[Chorus: LL, Erick]
DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about
MI - you ain't goin - FA
L said it - SO, puffin on the - LA

DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about
MI - you ain't goin - FA
E said - SO, puffin on the - LA (.. TI DO)

[Erick Sermon]
Uhh, E Dub on the microphone
Droppin bombs - spots get blown
So why would you assume my style wouldn't bloom
When I rap, wack MC's vacate the room
Cause they suck, and that's how I feel
I'ma smack down the A&R who signed the deal
Then wrap 'round his neck yo' reel to reel
So next time he know, how the real feel
Get loose and wrap hand 'round the steel
Leave you in the truck, wrapped 'round ya wheel
(I ain't playin) But why'all front like I ain't it
And every rapper why'all like, sample my shit
(Name one) I'm nice, and there's no mistakin
I threw a bomb rhyme in the hands of Troy Aikman
My track record is out there, gone
E.T. like maybe I should phone home (hello?)
I'm known for the dome bangers
Drop any song of mine right now in the club and it's DANGER
Scarface, E, LL Cool (jigga jigga)
J, never heard it spit this way, hey

DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about

L said it - SO, puffin on the - LA (that's right)

DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about

Cause 'Face said - SO, puffin on the - LA (.. TI DO)

You a trash-ass nigga, slash garbage-ass rhymer
You switched from the raw to a chart climber
And now your shit is blowin out the stores
and uh, next month you fin' to go out on the tour but
Count - (two, three, and, four)
Your records ain't sellin no more
And damn - you done spent your money galore
Buyin all the stupid shit that your money can't afford (uh-oh)
Tryin to keep up with the trendy
Got your bitch minked out in all Fendi
Bought your homeboy a brand new Bentley
And the well that wouldn't run dry is now empty
It's simply, cause you wasn't focused on the next day
and your next tape you can't give it away, but hey
I send these to these niggaz tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Everything you see me I owns it
I've been quietly sellin tapes for thirteen years
So let's get, that, clear
You might have sold a few more tapes, but
realistically, are you that great? (nah)
Can't get respect but I done paid dues
Stood on the block slangin cooked up rocks, I'm the same dude

Ya teflon don't protect, waist down and neck up
I trailer park and just trash ya rap up
Ya want some more? fuck it, wait until the next cut
",It's Nuttin'
Erick Sermon,"Yo, now when you hear the name Keith Murray, don't think violence
That's nonsense, me and Meth put that to silence
I'm a product of the streets, master of the breaks and beats
Lyrically headstrong and can't be beat

Triple minded, mentally combineded underground pirate
Microphone tyrant, always comin' sideways
And Topsy turvy, lyrical crash-up derby
Come, Filthy McNasty, pretty gritty dirty

Lyrical sayin' MC slayin', 'Hip Hop Quotable'
Unquotable, sociable thirty-eight caliber style swayin'
Open your mind to visualize what I'm sayin'
The products of the streets don't be playin'

It's a bloody ambush like a dirty douche in ya tush
When I push, push up in ya bush
Superstar status, break off beats, the baddest
Style's the baddest, bring extra clips to stop the madness

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Aiyyo we ain't playin' fair no more, there's somethin' new in store
A Hot Boy but not from the 504
New technique to rock the mic
Lyrical 'Blade' sharp like Wesley and N'Bushe Wright

Soundbombin' could be a catastrophe
When NASA blast off, Flex blast off me
E-vincible, rap round your left ventricle
So let's be sensible

E temperamental, quick to dismember you
Wyclef that 'November' you
They wish they can do what I can do
If you could switch brains, you would, wouldn't you?

My style is Mike, Vince, Earvin
Jordan, Carter, Julius, servin'
MC's at will, I'm trickery, Lou ain't stickin' me
A curve ball, Mark ain't hittin' me

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
Yo, what the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, rapid gunfire destroy ya boys and unemploy some
Put the headphones on your kid like Castor Troy's son
Darts'll damage ya dogs where the you-Haul in my truck
The camera installed, hand upon my balls

Call the morgue, I'm killin' 'em, even Kyle is not feelin' 'em
When I drill 'em with skills of ten Eminems
You feminine, don't even call my name
I stay locked down walkin' with a ball and chain

Put the mac where you tongue at, I done that
These young cats'll get thumbtacked and sent where Big Pun at
Smoke so much, the doc asked where my lung at
I took it out to stash my gun, son run that

Pop mega shit, I pop mega clips
Fuck a system, I keep the heat where your Sega sit
Then I bang the controller 'til the game say, ""Over""
In the Bricks, we'll stick ya when ya plane lays over

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, y'all know me, maniacs and addicts add it, at it
Venomous addict snake biter, I the, at it
'Cause I'm a little odder at it
In the Ac' with the aircraft and then leave inactive

My alter-ego make niggaz alter their egos
I flow and turn the East coast to one big creep show
South premisy, Filthy-delphia pistol bangers
Pistol changin', pistol bangin'

I lift metal like Lithuanians
Two thousand nail me Sy Scott rap's new insanian
It's humane, punish ya mayn
'Til no skeletal remains remain remain mainly main

To bitten man made disease that's made by man
Crackin' the DNA code to see how God made man
I storm the mainland, scare MC's like slave hands
Put microchips in they wristbands and make 'em rain dance

Lay hands like Mike Strahand
Puttin' ya face and hands in Ace bands
Tryin' to lift more than ya waistband

I travel every shinin' sea, sea and land to finally see
When niggaz land in the error era wherever, forever no error
Easily cut niggaz careers down like ever
Ever forever and ever, don't you ever
Fuck with Sy, Khi and Erick when we come together, what?

A brand new Benz with a mackadocious kit

Got more toys than Kay*Bee, me and my yung'uns
""Slow Down,"" before you receive a summons
And get hit for speeding; I break a switch off a tree

Shame on you, when you step to, huh
The Green Eyed Bandit, smile you on candid
Rob J. Timberlake, I got Janet
I'm ""In Control"" now  oh wow!

[Chorus]

Sermon, the word I preach to ya
Control the airwaves so it can reach to ya

High school dropout, I'm not gon' cop out
I did the rhymin thing and now a truck I hop out
""Fiesta,"" I'm down with R. Kelly shit
I'm ""Supa Dupa Fly,"" Missy Elliott
I stay focused, keep the same cycle
Do me, proceed to rock the world like Michael
Without Chris Tucker, with no Marlon Brando
Just give enough for J-Lo to handle
So scream at me, holla, smoke signals
Morse code, try a 2-way, or telephone
And I give it to ya, all day in street
Two turntables a mic and breakbeat, cause

Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes, those my people

Brick niggas get real ugly
Trust me, keep your four if you feel lucky
Mug me, I ain't got nothin' but four figures
And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender
My shots like squeegy men on your window
Usual suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walkin' awkward
While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it
The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it
Yo' bitch is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up with King Cobra
Out in the Nova, don't bother
My Nino Brown bust, it'll shut down the corridor

When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out
Total recall for people to breathe

I got dogs in the backyard shittin' their lawns
We got chickens ain't leaving 'till six in the morning
Round and round we go, circle the area
Leave the party, go straight to the Marriott
Dozy-doe with cowboys where they saddle at
Rodeo with 20 fours on the Cadillac

(New York, stand up)

Yeah, I'm on the block, man, chillin'
I'm parked by the Rucker park, I'm just chillin'
Underground love my spot, I'm just chillin'

It's like that, you know how it is, we just chillin'
And I get the paper so

MC and ma, people call me Whip
I'm just chillin' all alone, no one to be with, man
I took long but I'm finally here
The most anticipated chick of the year, cheaugh

I came to flip and reverse game
Every dude that I touch get whipped like my first name
And although I'm prissy, don't get it confused
I don't need to mess with you, I've got plenty of dudes

Got the caramel skin, on the parallel twin
Heads keep turnin' like a carousel spins
I know for a fact, these women are sick
'Cause these hoes can't mess with this Dominican chick

Got the flag on my arm, it proves I am the bomb
All I do is speak Spanish and it works like a charm
I been ready, 'cause I payed my dues
Yo, this goes out to my Brooklyn crew

I don't care
Yo

You might catch me on the train, okay, I'm just, chillin'

Y'all non-rappin' chicks can keep chillin'
Talk if you want 'cause

Ayo, E is chillin', Kwe is chillin'
Whip in the house, Brooklyn in the buildin'
Blood on the dance floor, sweat on the ceilin'
When you get that feelin' that gun concealin' is a hobby

Nobody stealin' shows like Kweli
Workin' on a new project while you chillin' in the lobby
Keep it thorough, ain't real, guns don't kill
People kill people but the Sun don't chill

But still, I stand cooler than a Minnesota winter
Nigga, hotter than the blocks where guns bust over dinners
Plus, all the sinners got dreams they runnin' after
Workin' a 9 to 5 now, is like you hustlin' backwards

That's why all these young girls in love with the rappers
Basketball players and up-and-comin' actors
Swimmin' with the sharks and flirtin' with disaster
When the things you own start ownin' you, they your master

Yeah
I don't care

I got the yak in the back of the club, I'm just chillin'
With Whip and my nigga E Dub, we just chillin'
Nobody give a fuck about you, we chillin'
But I smack the shit out you, like

So if you really wanna know how it is, I'm just chillin'

Uh, industry uh
(Where are you goin' to) Uh

Aye yo what's goin' on y'all (nothin') whats up?
It's a few things you should know so let's touch up (okay)
I was once one of y'all, I admit
But I never judge a book by it's cover, mine was ripped
Look, most of y'all was a first class member
And now you're gone and it's past November
Word to Wyclef, I test the best
To go against the industry, without plan B
And don't count those that made it
Even those one hundred million bucks still don't equal up
Yo, where you live, you got a crib?
I bet you got some brand Timbs, car got brand new rims
Look, it happened to Prince, it happened to Michael
It happened to Bobby, it happened to Whitney, is y'all wit me?
Yo, things go wrong when there's no hit song
This chorus made for you, so y'all sing along, come on

(Do you like the things that life is showin' you)
(Where are you goin' to)

Second, aye yo I done checked the Vibe on any Rap Sheet
It's the same beefs, even athletes (uh-huh)
There's five types of ballplayers
Volley, foot, soccer, basket, base - all in the same race (to win)
What happen when the clock stop (uh?)
Injury, and no more wicked jump shots (two!)
ESPN ends
There goes your Two million fans and there goes your friends (uh-huh)
They don't care who you are and what you did
You a ""Where Are They Now?"" VH-1 type kid (it's over)
Major fact is, all the actors mad
Cause they Rolls been takin' by rappers
""How High?"" You thought you had it all figured out
Get the car, get the truck, and then get the house (uh-huh)
Touchy subject, I ain't wanna paint this picture
But Picasso's dead, so I did it instead, do you know

[Chorus]

Listen, uh-huh
This is for the nine to five worker, or nine to five hustler
That had to make ends meet, in the kitchen or the street
I wish drugs was food and water was liquor
So you'd kick back, kill thirst and not kill niggas
Every real gangsters dies
Tony, Al Capone, Gotti, Bonnie & Clyde
It's almost done for you, it's about to end

Damnit, it's the Bandit, new Hummer in transit
Twenty-seven inches come standard (YO!)
This my people, whether drivin the Benz, the Pinto
Or the Regal, the Range Rover, the Beatle (uh)

I'm in New York now but I represent the SWATS of A-Town
When I touch down amid grounds
Me and L-Dub and Redman, that's it mo'fuckah
You heard what I said man, that's real (what the deal)

It's E-Dub, pronounce it right
Eyes green like Kryptonite, so good night!

Top droppin' that Benz 'til it, came with the leather seat

Back up off my whip or I jump out and cause a tragedy
St. Louis to Florida, from N.Y. to Tennessee
Them boys ride 20's, them niggaz from the hay
Them boys flickin Bentleys, Benz, Lex and Escalades
Them boys ride clean, twist and turnin in yo' face

With that chameleon paint, fresh as {?}
I pull up in a fo'-fo'-two with E-Dub
With a convertible top on the Chevy, we like what
Def Squad in this piece, you want it we give it to ya

You don't want no trouble with me, I might do ya

My God's my gun, don't need him since cerebreal cock
Beat him size ammo three to five mammal we the Gods

Pack of wolves that act a fool, blood on they upper lip

""You're a Customer"" type flow, when I rhyme slow
That was 15 years ago - if you want to hear that

then buy that tape, and hear that flow (YO!)
Jah said somethin like you have to grow
Can't stagnate the flow, cause you said so
I walk this way, cause I've paid dues

Of Hugh Jack, hands packin', make you an 'X-man'
Time for some action and matter of fact
Go exercise or be ordained to explore pain

And explain, why you puttin' extras on

Settle down 'fore I set it off on your set
Let's say Santiago is the best you heard yet

He goin on when Sy be goin off
In the cross my Squad run tracks like motocross
I write words I read and then re-word 'em
Same word, rework 'em without re-wordin 'em
Word perfect for workin with 'em
Workmen do homework, men at work in the network workin system
Yeah, I overwork, work the middle
Work and turn your homework workbook against you
In the range of a roundabout ratio
I merry-go-round around around the radio
Around around and away we go
Everytime Sy bust down then it's up up away you go

[Chorus: Keith Murray]
Now what do you niggaz think about this
A jam for the streets that you can't resist
So hustle to this, bang to this
Get your money to this, yeah listen to this
Now what do you bitches think about this
A jam for the clubs that you can't resist
So shake to this, freak to this
Drink up to this, yeah listen to this

[Verse Two: Erick Sermon]
Uhh, huh
E-Dub, I'm known like the Rucker
Fucker, comin through like a redneck trucker
Nother, man down, call 9-1-1
I stash that so they can't find my gun
I'm in the woods like hikers, bikers, campers
Antlers, bears snakes and long-leg tarantulas
Uh, E-Dub I got balls
If I get chased pon' de river like Sean Paul, believe it
I'm on the fish neck, like jet-skis
I killed Romeo, along with Jet Li
And messin with the E be incomparable
Get romped like Romper Room, a one man platoon
Oh I say, I'm Andrew Dice Clay
Filthy mouth and also fuck why'all
You want to get physical we touch why'all
Haters we appreciate the love so - thank you very much why'all

[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Keith Murray]
Last but not least, Keith wreck shop comfortably
When I flow, I fuck up your street credibility
Def Squad get busy often
When it comes to chicks we got more tricks than a dolphin
You see the new E-Dub spin when I pull up
Ecko sweatsuit with the hood up
This shit is so hot you could cook an egg on it
So I sunny-side up, buttered toast my opponents
I take the drama to the middle of the street
Or any nigga that's feelin himself like Tweet
Kid you sonned out, let me speak to your father
Matter of fact, hold these here, and don't even bother
We come through with the nines poppin
Niggaz get so quiet, you can hear rats pissin on cotton
So you see there's nothin furthermore to say
Aiyyo Busta, ""Pass the Courvoiser""

[Erick Sermon]
Yeah, all day yeah, uh
Turn me up, uh-huh...it's serious
Headphones turn me up
{Recordings indistinct)

This is somethin that you need to hear
It's cool and capture
I feel like Blondie caught in the rapture
Rappers and those who try to offend me
From false accusations they had heard from Wendy (Hello Erick)
I'm in the game to play
For those cats on the sideline callin me gay, huntin
Don't be the broads cause niggaz
Mad cause I'm baggin chicks that look as bad as Jigga's (tell 'em)
And make seven figures, a rap icon
I'm the one kid in the biz to keep your eyes on
Me, Superman, I fell from the window
If I fly high, then why drive a benzo
In drive a 'lac, in drive a hummer
In drive is something brand-new this summer (tell 'em)
The operator, I got your number
Don't act like I don't flow like water, call the plumber (uh-huh)
Something tryna stop the E from gettin large
I feel like the Beastie Boys in Sabotage
In all five boroughs, I pissed on trees
I'm a dog (arroo), ask Rockwilder please
There's some fake cats, they talk behind me
A few A&R's sayin they won't sign me (uh-huh)
Cause they see my face and think I'm done
Meanwhile, I'm the black Neo, yes the one (one)
While they sign they brother or friend or they man
That's supposed to blow, he's a no-show
And that's why the game is shutdown
Every major player that's in it, been changed around (tell 'em)
But I'm still standin and got something to say
The boy is still here like LL and Dre
I sat down with Russell and Def Jam team
I sat down with Suge and Jimmy Ivine
I sat down with Sylvia, sat down with Tommy
Sat down with Clive Davis and no favors
I got booked at dark
And this might be my last huh-rah
I'ma rock now until tomorrow
Some ask about EPMD's prognosis
But it won't happen til P get focused
I won't be compared to Nas or Jada
But I'ma punish the game for it's foul behavior
And y'all got it backwards
Those ain't real MC's, those is actors
Cast of Fear Factor (tell 'em)
I agree with Missy
No creativity in the game no more
It's the same old bore
A few people in the biz know what's happenin
The fans don't know, they think I'm platinum
Cause they hear the record gettin played 4,000 times on every station
But at the same time hate...disc jockeys
If I'm over, explain how I do it
In 2001 I shut it down with ""Music"" (hmmm)
If I'm whack, why in 2002, yes it's true, I made cats react (uh-huh)
Source might not quote this here
It might not be nothin but I wrote this here
Like Eminem said, you want to be Erick Sermon (that's the truth)
But you a generic version (let's go)

Tryin to stay up out of prison, steady spittin raps
Not to mention spittin scraps, don't mix your puddy-tat with that

Don't ride through without your pistol, put it on your lap

And miss it each night and day

I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Es preferible cada quien para su lado
Se que a tu vida esto llegando un nuevo amor
Lo se hace tiempo no tienes porque negarlo

Se que no soy perfecto ni siquiera tengo nada
Que simplemente soy un loco que te ama

You wander down the lane and far away

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Na na na nananana, nannana, hey Jude",Hey Jude
Erik Grönwall,"Hey, I'm a believer
And gravity's letting go of me tonight
You, came out of nowhere
When everything was passing by at the speed of light

So hold my hand and never let me go
Take a leap of fate into the unknown

I am flying
My heart is taking over
The world is flashing by
Higher higher higher
I will follow wherever it might take us
Chasing through the sky
Higher higher higher
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/erik_gronwall/higher.html ]
Oh I know
It can be scary
You bet it all when your heart is on the line
But oh, baby don't worry
Just hold my hand and never let me go

I am flying
My heart is taking over
The world is flashing by
Higher higher higher
I will follow wherever it might take us
Chasing through the sky
Higher higher higher",Higher
Erik Hassle,"I knew I had what I wanted
But still I wanted more
A drink or two got me started
And now I just can't get over you
The grass is so green on the other side
At least it felt so at the time
All I got was a troubled mind
And now I just can't get over you

So it comes a bitter end
Guess I blew it once again
Still I haven't learned my lesson well
I can't get over you
Could you spit me in the face
Could I starve a houndred days
Whatever it takes to break this spell
I can't get over you
Could you please give me forgivnes
And wash my sin away
Cuz' without love my life is pretty pointless
I just can't get over you

So it comes a bitter end
Guess I blew it once again
Still I haven't learned my lesson well

Erik Jekabson,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Como un fantasma necesita ver la fe 
Salió de mí detrás de ti, no soporto el dolor que dejaste aquí 
En un rincón de esta ciudad 
Yo seguiré esperando resucitar 

Porque tu voz puede cambiar estos sueños muertos, 
Toda esta soledad sin rumbo 
Con tu voz pintas el mundo de color… 

Ayer soñé que en tu interior había una ventana y entraba yo 
Era feliz, brillaba con tu luz 
Sin puntos cardinales, perdido en el azul 
En un rincón de esta ciudad 
Yo seguiré esperando resucitar 

Porque tu voz puede cambiar estos sueños muertos, 
Toda esta soledad sin rumbo 
Con tu voz pintas el mundo de color… 

Precipicios se abren a mis pies, 
Infinitos, obscuros sin tu ser 
Me tiro a la nada 
Al respirar baja mi alma sin la piel como un papel 

No estas aquí. Todo en mi muere sin querer… 
No hay más, no hay más sin ti 

Porque tu voz puede cambiar estos sueños muertos,

What a man's gotta do

Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart

Erika Ender,"Traigo entre las manos un puñado de mis versos
Para regalarte de a poquito lo que siento
Traigo entre los labios la humedad que cubre un beso
Y algo de inocencia entremezclada con deseo

Traigo un par de estrellas que iluminen nuestra noche
Y un reloj de arena para hacer que el tiempo sobre
También traigo novedades en las olas de mi cuerpo
Para que levantes ancla y me navegues mar adentro

Te traigo vida
Te traigo todo
Te traigo lo que tú quieras
Te traigo sueños
Te traigo antojos
Te traigo un mundo de ideas
Te traigo mares de fantasías
Lo que no exista, lo que haga falta
Te traigo aquello que tú me pidas
Con tal de que no te vayas

Traigo alas inmensas que te lleven a lo alto
Y un vino que ahoga las heridas del pasado
Traigo una maleta llena de improvisaciones
Para no dejar que la rutina nos agobie",Con Tal de Que No Te Vayas

Y a su recuerdo le sigo siendo fiel
Y aunque me dicen su adios fue para bien

Que están seguros que tiene un nuevo amor
Guardo en el fondo la esperanza
De que regrese y que se quede

Nunca que soy yo quien lo conoce de verdad conmigo donde
Se que volvera porque nunca encontrara otra amor como el
Que yo le se brindar

Conmigo en menos tarde que te tardes volvere a andar de su
Mano yo se que me va a extrañar
(Yo se que me va a extrañar)
Yo se que me va a extrañar

Nadie le sabe sus gustos y costumbres
Nadie le entiende sus gestos como yo
Porque en el fondo en una simple mirada
Se lo que quiere y lo que no
(Se lo que quiere y lo que no)

Y aunque me digan que tal vez ya me olvido
Que están seguros que tiene un nuevo amor
Guardo en el fondo la esperanza
De que regrese y que se quede

Yo se que vuelve a mi vida
Regresa tarde o temprano
Y entonces te lo aseguro
Aquí lo estaré esperando
Ay yo se que vuelve tarde o temprano
Yo te lo aseguro el regresara

Who needs the pressure of another frantic season
It doesn't seem to make much sense

How does he walk upside down?

The ceiling is just like the ground to him
Sammy, with toes so unbelievably strong
Where ever he is, he can never go wrong

Let me share some secrets of how I learned to scat
I took a simple melody and changed it just like that

First I sang the melody straight
Then I started to wait behind the beat
Then I started changing the melody
Then I changed the rhythm
Then I came in early, then I came in late

Scat's My Bag
I sing whatever I hear
Scat's My Bag
I sing whatever I hear

It never sounds the same
I try to use my brain
But I mostly use my ear

From the cd entitled, ""Scat's My Bag""

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

The band's biggest guitar
Is called the stand up bass
It makes many sounds
At any volume, at any pace

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

It can sound like a dinosaur singing
Or a huge corn kernal when it pops!
And even more surprising than this
Is when you hear it play double stops

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

Sometimes it lays down the harmony
Sometimes it grooves on the beat
Sometimes it sings like a bird
A bird with REALLY big feet!

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

A bass can get real funky
A bass can really swing
A bass can play it really straight
Just go on and do your own thing!

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

Erika Paul,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Tailgate Trombone Bob [Afro Cuban Son/Mambo]
Erika Paul,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear 
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again

Sometimes I wish life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
He used to say so strong, oh unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Erimha,"Granted with a burden
An untameable force at times
A thousand nights of darkness
Have led me to emptiness
As my heart is frozen
I am pacing into the cold
To the chant of my blood 
Boiling for war

Infused with hatred 
The ideal must seep in
Possessed with her ghost
And a hundred other demons
Clearing my mind of their melodies
Will sing me to sleep

Dreaming of the past
I embrace this moment of peace
Seasons have perished through conflict

The storm has shaded my visions
Tarnished at times, the will to be I

Rising the sun to a mist of dead illusions
We are fire burning under the stars
As we are clothed in flames

Empty spaces where time ceased to exist
Scales of color have no meaning
And no shapes take form

A voyage through consciousness
A kingdom beyond beliefs

And sometimes it controls me

My eyes can see where most are blind
Leaving a bitter understanding of mankind
Its will, the lost values throughout centuries 
Resonates in me

Opening my veins for fire to flow

The beasts of prey have left no legacy
Depraved, it manifests its power
Still the parasites 
Continue to devour

Raging against this symmetry 
Unworthy of its power
To overpower at will

I am straddling both spheres
An existence linked through this vessel

The comprehension of senses
The boundaries of emotions 
A way led by fear, the distress to be
Unfulfilling in this tomb to me
An unconceivable existence

The other, unknown, misunderstood
Envisioned as a plague, a land of no return

Entwine with time, la bête noire vaincra

Challenging intuition into conflict 
Inconsistent current, conveys the way of the path divided

I do not resent time but understand the reason behind

But the choices have branded my memoirs

In an unspoken tongue
The pain is screaming through the doors

I am yearning for a souvenir
Walls are fallen revealing the will of a new beginning
I’ve been constantly looking for a way out of this world
There is no freedom walking the path of men

Only a restricted line far from the stars we should be
So I flew beyond boundaries
And met the everlasting fire

I am the none seeker of exemption
I shall bear the mark of liberation

Nothing has been real 
For I was blind
No eyes can see
Where the heart need to feel

The gateways of my own ascension

My soul is seething for something pure
The untouched landscapes of my mind
A virgin road pasted through the black holes
Where no barrier lies between a formless phantom 

I vanquish with distortion 
And walked with the dead 
I am the seed of a destructive core
Condemned and blessed I can see beyond and fall below

Through the circles
Unpaid my contained essence

Avulsing with gigantic waves
I am sailing with no destination

All breathing at the same time but

Completely unaware of any synchronization
The stars still sing at night

Giving the sun the rhythm to rise to 
Ages have passed

But what is time anyway
In this everlasting womb

Embracing every part 
Of this experience

A dream that I could make come true
I'd go to a place where I'd see his face
And he'd say I've been waiting for you

He could just fly me to the moon
We would be on our honey moon

That'd be something if I had one night with Frank
He would be singing at the sand
Swinging with Bassey and the band
What could be better than to have one night with Frank?

Anything goes when the summer winds blows
I can see why they say old blue eyes
Through night and day, his old black magic ways
Would keep my hypnotized

He could be loving all of me
And we'd be dancing cheek to cheek
I would have my way if I had one night with Frank

Come fly with me from here to eternity
A fine romance that would be
As time goes by, come rain or come shine
They can't take that away from me

For once in my life I could be
On the sunny side of the street

Just making whoppy
If I had one for my baby
If I had luck, be a lady
If I had one night with Frank
One more time

Just making whoppy
If I had one for my baby
If I had luck, be a lady

He's only doing half his dance

Where we can barely breathe

And no, we shouldn't take it slow

Their busy keeps me high
This quiet town is wearing me down tonight
I know that I should stay here for awhile

Erin O'Donnell,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Erin Shields,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

 We was out on a back road
 Me and my woman was just gettin' right

 The radio blasting in the front seat
 Turning out the music fine
 We was snuggled up in the back seat
 Making up for lost time

 With good intent
 But there's something about a confrontation on a back road
 Breaks down the defense

 There's a sound outside the front door
 And I know it's just the wind
 But it makes her snuggle up just a little bit closer

Erlend Øye,"On a racecourse, there's a race to reach an end
Someone's calling the decathlon athlete's name
Further focus on the discipline applied
Or through constant shifts of exercise

Quatre cents mètres, saut à la perche,
Mille cinq mètres, cent mètres, saut en hauteur,
Lancer do javelot do poids et do disque,
Cent dix mètres haies, saut en longueur

There's a battle between the athlete and himself
And between him and the people there to help
Their incentive is for the pressure to conceive
The ignition of another level of reach

Do I want this in my life?
Is it worth it?
Worth the sacrifice?",The Athlete

I'm jumping out of the game
By being a referee
Sometimes all I can do
Find a spot out of the light
Feel like a Japanese

Every party's got a winner and a loser,
Some girls are never alone
I'm always a little late
Each our own individual game plan
We ploy in order to stay
Out of the bottom half

Who's there with whom?
Who failed to show?
Who'll leave alone?

Since the birth of the very idea,
Way back in hellenical times
At the house of a bearded man
Every party's got a winner and a loser
One host who's gonna regret
Telling all they could feel like home
One Jew that no one invited
Three guys in love with one girl
Who takes hours to say goodbye",Every Party Has a Winner and a Loser
Erlend Øye,"Crash on the highway,
Stranded between
My friends had waited,
But left without me
A glimpse on the platform,
We met on the train
She came from further,
Heading my way

Three days in April,
Three years ago
One black eyed stranger
I learned to know
Made all my plans stop
Shook me off track
Ten days of longing
I followed her back

A plane made of paper
Struck by the light
Circled forever
Over the city at night
Like a movie,
Like a song,
How it should be
Being young",Ghost Trains

The wall in two and points
To where your hand is stretched

My baby, you're everything to me
When you're gone, there's no one,
I'm just lonely

But that's all I could call
Someone as sweet as you

Here and now
The air the light
Has burst into between
Where you and I
We rest unfold
And melt like gold",Like Gold
Erlend Øye,"I was looking for a woman to be good to me
I was with the other people and they had to eat
I couldn't go alone, I didn't know my way
Don't know the language, so I had to stay
Woke up in the morning with a job to do
Twenty seconds later got stuck in the queue
When in Rome they're digging to extend the lines,
They're running into ruins, gotta stop all the time
Went upon a hill to get a view of the town,
Didn't really happen 'cause the clouds were down
Brought a CD player to be checking our song,
Didn't do recordables we moved along
To an elevated garden overlooking the street
She was standing with a spinett at the side of her feet.
Shouted to her promising to make her a star
She didn't have the time and she left in a car

Prego amore vieni con me.

Waiting for a DJ, but he never turned up
Figured that he didn't 'cause he knew he would suck
I was sitting in the rhythm backing the beat
Couldn't see her dancing back on the street
Just because you got the magic happening then
Doesn't make it certain it'll happen again
Just because you know someone is looking for you
Doesn't have a say in who they're running into",Prego Amore
Erlend Øye,"Brave girl replies
When you come back, I'll be gone
Read off her rules,
When in control I move on
Thoughtful or sad,
No need to ask

You in her eyes a sister someone
Who's been where
She's roaming now
Flashes of home
And people there
Pressured caught up she feels,
Measured all up revealed

I still haven't walked my distance
I'm not ready to return

Independent on my way to become I

Sunday no sign,
Why did I meke you meet me here?
No cause for doubt,
But feeling sustains
When mix up clears
Easy and loose,
Unsure confused

I've been living a sheltered life",Sheltered Life
Erlend Øye,"A sudden rush of expectation
As I realise it's you
Like a river in a droughtful season
How cool you didn't call
Initial hint of disappointment
The mirror of my smile
That isn't there, that doesn't follow
A very causal 'hi'

Why did you come at all,
If it wasn't for me?
Another blow of resignation
When realise I do

Now in your hands
The book you borrowed
The whole way we first met
Comes together in my head,
When the picture's clear you've left",Sudden Rush
Erlend Øye,"What you kept saying
And what I was told
Never related,
So I don't know,
Maybe tomorrow
Or Wednesday,
But I'll find excuses
To wait, wait, wait

The only date that's certain,
The wedding of our friends,
I think it's for the better,
I keep my cool till then
One out of many
Not how it feels,
But how I'll think of you
At the end of the year

I don't know what's happening to me
Is it a symptom of disease?

Wish I could tell you
About the distance between
How my life is unfolding and
How I thought it would be
Wish you were someone
With whom I could share what I find
In the people and places
In this new world of mine",Symptom of Disease
Erlend Øye,"And so I'm back and I am stuck here in the same room
A thorough shuffle to the mail my first excuse
Not to immediately face the day's agenda
Some very awkward words I need be telling you

of a feeling that in motion through I've carried
For it to be worn off upon return
That grew inside me like a credit taken
In a currency I could no longer earn

No better way,
No other time,
No other call,
No better line,
As soon as now, within your room
It can't go on
I'm not in love with you

My mouth has got a funny taste of metal,
A pencil line's been drawn upon my face
Weight has come to hang around my shoulders
For the knowledge of a doubt I can't erase

Hey boy you never finish what you've started
Says the man I wanna be who I am not
Who will sacrifice his part as easy lover
To never be the one who holds and drops",The Talk

Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light

Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be

Solo per avere un pasto facile
Io sono ancora qui
Ho la pelle dura pure più di te

Non è mai semplice
Accettare di riconoscerti
Tra le mie rughe che
Assomigliano sempre di più alle tue
E questo sangue che
Sa un po' di mostro e anche un po' di me
Mi fa pensare che vorrei dirti grazie
Perché non ci sei

Poche rughe
Di espressione
Più nient'altro di te
Sopravvive in me
Un cognome da portare
Solo questo sarai
E mai più mi vedrai

Di mostri come te
N'è pieno il mondo e non è facile
Scoprirli e sai perché
Hanno mani bianche e voce docile
Ma se li guardi bene

Ermal Meta,"Ti ricordi quand’eri bambino 
Con I sogni legati al cuscino 
Ti ricordi quand’eri capace 
Di sentirti con poco felice

Ti ricordi le notti a parlare 
E a incollare la luna nel cielo

Per stare male penso a te e me

Di affrontare la parte più dura 
Ma per quanto difficile sia

Ti volevo bene e forse anche di più 
Fuoco che non brucia non si spegne mai

Cuore che si stringe non tradisce mai 
E non ricordo come mai non ci sei più 
Ti manco, non lo so 
Mi manchi e non lo sai

Odio le favole 
E il gran finale perché 
Quello che conta è 
Qualcosa per cui una fine non c’è 
Non ci credere 
Se ti dicono che 
Passerà da se

Io la stringevo per portarti via di là 
E la paura frantumava i pensieri
Che alle ossa ci pensavano gli altri

Da un libro di odio ad insegnarmi l’amore

Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I got out my camera and was laughing

I said, ""Baby, it's scary
When it's so beautiful

Why does it hurt me
To feel so much tenderness?

'Cause I don't want to end it
To be perfectly candid ?

Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness

Wish you could see it, too

And all I have to do today
Is make you happy
The only thing you have to say
Is, ""It's all lovely, baby""

Late that night, we checked into the Bellevue
Held you close, but, baby ? couldn't tell you

And we stayed in our Calvin's
And we swore we'd be best friends

And turn the jukebox low

Mom, I didn't know, that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won
I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did, when I was a kid
And I'd come home with mud on my feet
The captain just gave us our orders
And Mom, we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But now I'll just say I love you

And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name

And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight

But God in his mercy was with me one day the gate was left open and I ran away

The door I then opened and there on the stand I saw a picture of her and the man
The clothes she was wearing told me the sad tale
My darling was wearing a new bridal veil
Then I found a letter and these words I read missing in action she thought I was dead

So I kissed her picture and whispered goodbye
My poor heart was breaking but my eyes were dry
I knew it was too late for her now to learn

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Ernestine Anderson,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Ernestine Anderson,"When skies are cloudy and grey, 
They're only grey for a day, 
So wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away. 
Until that sunshine peeps through, 
There's only one thing to do, 
Just wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away. 
Your castles may tumble, 
That's Fate after all, 
Life's really funny that way. 
No use to grumble, 
Just smile as they fall, 
Weren't you King for a day? 
Say! 
Just remember that sunshine 
Always follows the rain, 
So wrap your troubles in dreams, 
And dream your troubles away.",Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams
Ernestine Anderson,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony

About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony

Ernestine Anderson,"Lost in the shuffle, I've drifted an' strayed 
Bruised by the city, bewildered, betrayed 
With a heart heavy laden with faltering strides 
I have come to the bridge, to the line that divides! 

What am I doing up here in a daze 
As I gaze at the cold river bed? 
Why do I ask myself, ""Shall I go back 
when I seem to be going ahead?"" 

To black moonlight! 
Where everything reflects your colour 
Darkness that is endless. 
nights that leave me friendless . . . blue! 

Black moonlight! 
You make the lights of Harlem duller 
Just like me you're faded, jaded and degraded . . . too! 
Why must you send . . . 
ebony moonbeams, depressing, distressing . . . 
like shadows of love that are gone? 

Where will it end? 
Will it spread on to the starlight, the sunlight 
and darken each promise of dawn? 

Black moonlight! 
I've lost all power to resist you 
Madly, I await you, even though I hate you 
Black, black moonlight!

Shot from where the action is, a rhapsody in black and blue

Love lies under western eyes, powerful yet transient
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

If I had to choose just one day
To last my whole life through
It would surely be that Sunday
The day that I met you

Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills
Summer was a-coming in but fast
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills
Nodding all together, I could almost hear them whisper
""Go on, kiss her, go on and kiss her""

If I had to choose one moment
To live within my heart
It would be that tender moment
Recalling how we started
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me
That way, that Sunday, that summer

Ernestine Anderson,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

Ernestine Anderson,"The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night, in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world, ages old

The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace

You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace

I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.

Just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
Is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
And when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
And if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
It's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak

And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

Over the shadows and the rain
