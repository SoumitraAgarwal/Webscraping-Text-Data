Roger Miller,"I hear tell you're doin' well
Good thing have come to you
I wish I had your happiness
And you had a do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka-do

They tell me you're runnin' free
Your days are never blue
I wish I had your good-luck charm
And you had a do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka-do
Yeah, I see you're goin' down the street in your big Cadillac
You got girls in the front, you got girls in the back
Yeah, way in back, you got money in a sack
Both hands on the wheel and your shoulders rared back
Root-doot-doot-doot-doot, do-wah

I hear tell you're doin' well
Good things have come to you
I wish I had your happiness
And you had a do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka, do-wacka-do

Yeah, I see you're goin' down the street in your big Cadillac
You got girls in the front, you got girls in the back
Yeah, way in back, you got money in a sack
Both hands on the wheel and your shoulders rared back

Roger Miller,"Well, he gave me fair warnin', he said let him alone
But I'd had one too many and refuse to go home
Then I said somethin' awful and then so did he
And he hit me and it hurt and my eyes couldn't see

Hard, hard headed me
I spoke out of turn once too often
I'd be better off in my coffin
Hard headed me

Well, she gave me fair warnin', many times my wife said
She said, if you aim to keep me, quit your fool hearty ways
I said, now listen woman, you better leave me alone
How long is forever that's how long she'll be gone

Hard, hard headed me
I spoke out of turn once too often
I'd be better off in my coffin
Hard headed me

Then they gave me fair warnin', all the folks in my town
They said, if you ain't gonna straighten up, we're gonna expel one clown
I said, now just a minute here, you can't do me this way
How far is it to the next town, I'm walking that way

Hard, hard headed me
Well, I spoke out of turn once too often
I'd be better off in my coffin
Hard headed me",Hard Headed Me
Roger Miller,"In the summertime, when all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'Cause you don't want my love
Some other time, that's what you say, when I want you
Then you laugh at me and make me cry
'Cause you don't want my love

You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me, than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone

In the summertime, when all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'Cause you don't want my love

Once upon a time, you used to smile and wave to me
And laugh with me, but now you don't
'Cause you don't want my love
Some other guy is takin' up all your time
Now you don't have time for me
'Cause you don't want my love

You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me, than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone

In the summertime, when all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'Cause you don't want my love",In the Summertime

Roger Miller,"One time a long time ago
On a mountain in Switzerland
Yo lo lo lo lo
There lived a fair young maiden
Lovely but lonely
Yo ho ho ho

Day after day she'd pine her heart away
Yo lo lo lo lo lo lady yay
cause no love came her way

One day her papa say
Someday we'll go down to the village in the valley
There you'll meet a nice young man
He'll ask for your hand
Then you'll be happy

But every day she grew unhappier
On the mountain in Switzerland
Yo lo lo lo lo
Every day a little bit lonelier
Which way to turn, which way to go

And day after day she'd pine her heart away
Yo lo lo lo lo lo lady yay
But no love came her way

Some say the maiden's dream never came true
She never got to go to the valley
If she did or not i really don't know
Wo...ho...ho ho
Did she die unhappy

I'd rather think she found her love
Wouldn't you rather think she did find love
Somewhere, someway
Yodel...lady...ay
Yodellady...ay",Swiss Maid
Roger Miller,"If you ever want to get depressed just come to this town
Nothing to do from dinner to breakfast in this town

Four street lights and one old grocery
I ain't long to stay here no siree
I'm bound to catch the next greyhound
Leavin' this town

I've seen towns, but no town as bad as this town
It don't take you long to feel lowdown in this town
Soon the cotton's gonna open up and I'm gonna pick it
Just long enough to make enough to buy myself a ticket
I'm bound to catch the next greyhound
Leavin' this town

Here I stand on the dusty road leavin' this town
Hopin' that dog ain't got a full load leavin' this town
The state built new access for travel
They got the pavement 'n we got the gravel
That's the reason everything's dying round here
In this town

We got very little sunshine day to day in this town
The mail don't run but every other day in this town

Four street lights and one old grocery
I ain't long to stay here no siree
I'm bound to catch the next greyhound
Leavin' this town

Well we don't reap, we don't sow in this town
Things are so bad the weeds won't grow in this town

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
This town can go the other place I'm going to heaven
I'm bound to catch the next Greyhound

Roger Miller,"Met you my country girl you didn't have a thing
I fell in love I dressed you up, then I bought the ring 
I was teaching you to love, you were leaning fine
Then one day you learned too much and it poisoned your sweet mind 
Now you've gone and left me you're with somebody new
But I wonder if you told him I bought the clothes on you 
When you two are dancin' and you whisper soft and sweet
I wonder if you'll tell him I bought the shoes on your feet 
Now you've gone and left me you're with somebody new 
But I wonder if you told him I bought the clothes on you 
When you two are dancin' and you whisper soft and sweet
I wonder if you'll tell him I bought the shoes on your feet",Country Girl
Roger Miller,"Well, I ain't never, I ain't never
Seen nobody like you, no, no, no
Never have I seen nobody like you

You call me up and say to meet me at nine
I have to hurry, hurry, but I'm there on time
I walk a'right up and knock on your door
The landlord says, ""she ain't a'here no more""

I ain't never, oh, darling
Seen nobody like you, boo hoo,
But I love you
Yeah, I love you, I love you just the same

You tell me sweet things that you don't mean
You've got me a'livin' in a haunted dream
You make me do things that I don't want to do
My friends all say what's wrong with you

I ain't never, oh darling
Seen nobody like you, boo hoo,
But I love you
Yeah, I love you
I love you just the same
I love you just the same
I love you just the same",I Ain't Never
Roger Miller,"I wish that I could fall in love today
But memories of you stand in the way
I just can't make my heart find someone new
It's always much too busy with the blues

I wish that I could fall in love today
But if I did I know I wouldn't stay
You'd come between us like you always do
Somehow they never measure up to you

Each night I pray I'll wake up at dawn and find
Another in my heart and on my mind
Then I awake and hear my poor heart say
I wish that I could fall in love today

(Repeat)",I Wish I Could Fall in Love Today
Roger Miller,"Well they call me a playboy
While I'm makin' my rounds
Chasing the bright lights
Of every night spot in town
Tho' I never show it
My hearts breaking in two
Yes they call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
But I'll never feel love
With somebody new
This false pride I'm wearing
Is to cover my blues
They call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
(Repeat)",Playboy
Roger Miller,"You've got me, under your spell again
Saying those things again
I gotta take you back just one more time
I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what is right or wrong
And I've been so lonely dear since you've been gone
You've got me, under your spell again
Saying those things again
You've got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
I gotta take you back just one more time
You've got me, under your spell again
Saying those things again
You've got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
I gotta take you back just one more time

Roger Miller,"Our little love no longer is our little love is gone
Our little love no longer lives I'm so blue so poor and so haunt
And so I guess my little heart is watchin' my call one of the breaks of the game
Broken in two feeling blue since our little love ain't the same
I gave to you a part of my heart but you threw your part away
Leavin' me forgotten just wonderin' what in the world makes my baby do me this way
Our little love no longer is
Our little love no longer is",Our Little Love
Roger Miller,"Here's a riddle, what has two eyes that cry constantly
For your love, you guessed it, it's me

Here's a riddle, what has two arms that long desperately
For your love, you guessed it, it's me

And your love was once all the treasure I'd known
Now that's gone
Gone on the wings of a wild dream
Now I'm all alone

One more riddle, what has one heart that beats faithfully
For your love, you guessed it, it's me

And your love was once all the treasure I'd known
Now that's gone
Gone on the wings of a wild dream
Now I'm all alone

One more riddle, what has one heart that beats faithfully
For your love, you guessed it, it's me",The Riddle
Roger Miller,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowing I'm not shacked by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted
On their columns, now that binds me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walking

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheet fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin
Can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry?
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind
",Gentle on My Mind
Roger Miller,"Let me be a little kinder
Let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those about me
Let me praise a little more

Let me be when I am weary
Just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others
And a little less of me

Let me be a little braver
When temptation bids me waiver
Let me try a little harder
To be all that I should be

Let me be a little meeker
With the brother that is weaker
Let me think more of my neighbor
And a little less of me

Let me be when I am weary
Just a little bit more cheery
Let me serve a little better
Those that I am striving for

Let me be a little meeker
With the brother that is weaker
Think a litle more of others
And a little less of me",Less of Me
Roger Miller,"With pen in hand 
You sign your name
Today at five 
I'll be on that train
And you'll be free
And I'll be alone
So alone

We can't find the love we once knew
If you think 
I can't make everything up to you
Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own

Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Hear what I say
Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night that she says her prayers
Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me

And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow 
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire 
To kiss me
Or to hold me

And if you can forget 
The good times we had
If you don't think 
They out weigh the bad

On my way
I'll be on my way",With Pen in Hand
Roger Miller,"She watches the soaps and pins all her hopes and her dreams
She lets her mind drift with the scripts that unfold on the screen

She can't live like they live but each day she sits there and tries
Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our wives

One life to live, one heart to give to her man
She's raising her babies and doing the best that she can

So she watches the soaps and sometimes just sits there and cries
Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our wives

So fly away heart on the wings of make believe things

Roger Miller,"Do the mornin's still come early
Are the nights not long enough
Does a tear of hesitation
Fall on everything you touch
Well, it might just be a lesson
For the hasty heart to know

Maybe lay and let your feelings grow accustomed to the dark
And by morning's light, you might solve the problems of the heart
And it all might be a lesson for the hasty heart to know
Maybe leavin's not the only way to go

They take a second look, maybe change their minds
People reach new understandings everyday
Tell me not to reach and I'll go away

Emptiness is all that waits inside for me
That's how it is when the one you love is gone

Things like these just make things that much worse

Roger Miller,"See the ruin on the hill where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten
Seems old Darby loved his wife and he labored all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession
Oh it took three hundred days for the timbers to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down when Darby's castle tumbled to the ground

Though they shared the common bed there was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping
Then one night he heard the sound as he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room
Split the shadows where two bodies lay in tangle
Oh it took three hundred days",Darby's Castle
Roger Miller,"You conjure up your courage and you finally make the telephone call
You get a busy signal else it rings and no-one answers at all

And I want you to know

I'm gonna teach my heart to bend instead of breakin'
Teach myself to lean and not to fall
Teach my heart to bend instead of breakin'
I've taken all I can take and that's all

Roger Miller,"He was born one mornin'
It was cold and it was snowin'
And from the start he never had a chance
And though the doctors said he couldn't live
His mama had some faith to give
And they brought him to her and his mama named him Vance

He was sick a long time then
I used to sit by him
I'd rub his head and he would squeeze my hand
But he never cried, he'd grit his teeth and smile at me
'Cause he couldn't speak
And that's when I began to respect the little man
And I think Vance was three right about then

He started school and one day
He came home and at the doorway I could tell
The little man didn't want to come inside
He had met a girl but her boyfriend Smitty
Had caught him walkin' home with her
And nearly killed Vance
But then Vance never cried
And the only thing that Smitty hurt was pride

And he said

""Papa do you become a man when you're twenty-one?""
And I said ""Age doesn't make a man a man, my son""

He looked at me so puzzled with eyes so young and kind
'n' I think Vance was seven about that time

I guess they say that first love is the very best
At least it was with Vance
'Cause he'd scratched ""Becky"" on his desk
But Becky went with Smitty and Vance was very small
And he used to dream what it'd be like to be tall
And then a few years later Vance came in one day
And told me and his mama that he had to go away
To be fitted for a uniform
And though his mama shed a tear
He kissed her and said he'd see us in two years
And he looked at me and said ""Papa, I'm gonna be a man""

Well, two years to the day
Vance came walkin' in the driveway and
I didn't recognize him from his size till he got near
He came in and he hugged his mama
And said ""Hey, Papa, little man, want to go with me somewhere 'n' grab a beer?""
So we're sittin' at this table when
This fella at the bar started buggin' Vance
Callin' him ""Soldier""
But Vance kept his cool
And he said ""Papa, that guy is Smitty and he's to be pitied now
'Cause that's the same guy that used to bully me in school.""

Then Smitty said the wrong thing
When he brought up Becky's name 'n'
Vance finally stood and said ""Boy, what did you say?""
And it did my heart so much good when Vance hit ole Smitty
And it took two of Smitty's friends to carry him away

Well, Vance left the very next mornin' 'n'
It was cold and it was snowin'
And from the first, life hadn't been much fun
But he had finally made a stand 'n'
He'd become a self-made man and
Incidentally, he had just turned twenty-one",Vance
Roger Miller,"Dear heart wish you were here 
To warm this night
Dear heart seems like a year 
Since you've been out of my sight
A single room 
A table for one 
It's a lonesome town alright
But soon I'll kiss you hello 
At our front door
And dear heart I want you to know 
I'll leave your arms never more",Dear Heart
Roger Miller,"Her head rolls back and forth
Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there

If she could only realize that the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly and pushing back advances with her hands

Every night I see her leaves a nightmare of illusions when she's gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man with a pain that lingers on

The gaudy goodbye can't replace the girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up that I'll never ever let her go

Too many nights I've watched her tease
By shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands
That cover up her satin lips

She struts upon the stage and her fallen victims are calling out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly and exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I'm gonna take her, I've infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore

And she asks a sawed off cigar smoking cat if he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage
Because they open tomorrow night in baltimore

God' if I have to crawl, I'm gonna be there tomorrow night in baltimore",Tomorrow Night in Baltimore

Roger Miller,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
And headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
And I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands with mine we finally
Sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when
Bobby sang the blues
Buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord
Through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothing, but it's free

And the redbird sings, I'll be blue

Sure wish you would love me like you did before

I guess you're forgetting me
Still each day I'm anxiously
Waitin' hopin' you may change your mind
Guess you're forgetting me

When we used to walk you put your hand in mine
But now you act as though you'd rather walk along behind
Tell me what's the reason for the way that you feel
Could it be you found yourself a better deal

I guess you're forgetting me
Still each day I'm anxiously
Waitin' hopin' you may change your mind
Guess you're forgetting me

Grape wine in a Mason jar
Homemade and brought to school
By a friend of mine 'n' after class
Me and him and this other fool decide that we'll drink up what's left
Chug-a-lug, so we helped ourself
First time for everything
Mm, my ears still ring

4-H and FFA on a field trip to the farm
Me 'n' a friend sneak off behind
This big old barn where we uncovered a covered-up moonshine still
And we thought we'd drink our fill
And I swallowed it with a smile
Bllll-bbbb, I run ten mile

Sumpin' like I ain't never seen
And I'm just going on fifteen
But with the help of my finaglin' uncle I get snuck in
For my first taste of sin
I said ""Lemme have a big old sip""

Roger Miller,"Well, here I sit high, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothing but a fool would live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman sittin' home with a month-old child

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

Just sittin' around drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought, and I bought five
And I spent the groceries and half the rent
Like fourteen dollars and twenty-seven cents

Dang me, dang me

High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

Sugar is sweet and so is maple surple

Roger Miller,"Engine, engine number nine
Comin' down the railroad line
How much farther back did she get off?
Old brown suitcase that she carried
I've looked for it everywhere, it
Just ain't here among the rest, and
I'm a little upset, yes, tell me

Engine, engine number nine
Comin' down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance
But it sure do make a difference
I don't think she loves me anymore

I warned her of the dangers
Don't speak to strangers, if by
Chance she finds new romance
Warmer lips to kiss her
Arms to hold her tighter
Stirring new fires inside her
How I wish that it was me, instead of he
That stands beside her

You're part of me like kisses are a part of love
You'll never leave my mem'ry long enough to see me cry
You'll always be green pasture between the rocky roads I travel on our love won't die

You'll always be part of me as surely as the waves will touch the shore
You'll brush my heart

You'll always be a part of me at least in memory
You'll always be the day for me because they say tomorrow never comes

Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there

If she could only realize that the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly and pushing back advances with her hands

Every night I see her leaves a nightmare of illusions when she's gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man with a pain that lingers on

The gaudy goodbye can't replace the girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up that I'll never ever let her go

Too many nights I've watched her tease
By shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands
That cover up her satin lips

She struts upon the stage and her fallen victims are calling out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly and exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I'm gonna take her, I've infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore

And asks a sawed off cigar smoking cat if he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage
Because they open tomorrow night in baltimore

God if I have to crawl, I'm gonna be there tomorrow night in baltimore",Tomorrow Night in Baltimore [*]

Home, where the trees grow tall 
The home fires burn, the whippoorwills call

My eyes would get big, and his chest would swell
I could sit for hours and listen with glee
As he'd tell of how he lived when he's a boy like me

Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Roger Nichols,"High on a snow covered mountain
From her throne she looks down at the clowns
Who think youth can be found in a fountain
High on the wings of her rhythm
She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes
But she'll never dance with them.
And in smoke filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around the snow queen
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you will soon bite the dust 
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser, but in midair
You'll be hung while you trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of the snow queen
No my friend, she doesn't want what you're selling
Go my friend, there must be a place you can hide
And into the night you'll fade, knowing
You lost the game and just how she got
Her name the snow queen",Snow Queen
Roger Powell,"See yourself as a child reaching out
 In search of a landmark to guide your way
 Put yourself to the test, the trial by fire
 'Cause it's the only way, the only way
 The future in balance on a high wire
 'Cross a valley of stars
 Makes you dizzy so don't look down
 Just keep on walking towards the other side
 After centuries of history's unfolding madness
 The force of nature tempering the human race
 We ain't got it right yet, but we can still
 Turn the whole thing around,
 Get ready for the new crusade
 I will be your landmark
 Show you the way when the path is lost
 Secrets all revealed
 And if we band together
 The universe we'll measure
 Knowledge that we hold in trust is our battle shield

 It's every man for himself now
 Too late to send out for help now
 Can't find the horizon
 My thoughts are capsizing
 Then the beam of truth shining clear
 Cuts through cloudy skies of doubt and despair
 And the pathway beneath your feet
 Will lead us on to solar mystique
 Temperature's rising
 Each moment it's climbing
 Strapped into this hot seat
 I can't take the heat now

Roger Quesnell,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Roger Rosenberg,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",That Old Devil Moon
Roger Rosenberg,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

To push things forward

I know you?re feeling me
Baby let me your fantasy
That?s how it?s supposed to be

Roger Taylor,"I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street

We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
>From the fire roads to the interstate
Now Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
And go racin' in the street
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world
We're going racin' in the street

He met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
He blew that Camaro off his back and he drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around his baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When he comes home the house is dark
She says 'Baby did you make it alright?'
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares out alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels

Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight tonight the highway's bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
Cause summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street",Racing in the Street

All children have to dream at night 
Eyes closed in sleep of innocence 
Sandman had come to us alright 
Beautiful dreamers lost in some never-never dream 
Beautiful dreams we had 
Just beautiful dreams 
Beautiful dreams we had alright 
Now we had found the golden key 
Door to a secret world 
Of chemical dreams 
Beautiful dreamers of beautiful dreams 
Beautiful dreams we had 
Such beautiful dreams 
We'd like to find a cure 
For every known disease 
There's no such thing you say 
The answer's there to see 
Colorful dreams we have at night 
Of nuclear purity

Just to make some plans for you some day.
But plans don't work and it's not that fine,

Don't it make you stop and wonder why?
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire,
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed,
Sometimes I want to burn down this crazy town.

I walk these streets each and every night,
Feel like I'm playing my role but it fits too tight.
Watch my life go by in black and white.
When times are hard and times are rough
Then you better be made of sterner stuff.

You'll find it's time to stop and wonder why.
I'm smokin', I'm burnin',
I'm twisting and turning
But one thing I'm learning.

It's the power of your love keeps me under their thumb
'cause the beat of your heart is the beat of my drum;
Don't it make you stop and wonder why?

With your news of the screws and your soaraway sun?
You sharpen our hatred
You've blunted our minds
We're drowning in nipples and bingo and sex crimes

Must they twist and lie?
Just to add to the grime they even screwed up the times
Love to kick their arse goodbye oh wouldn't I!

With your minions like vultures and carrion crow
They've sunk just as low as humans can sink

To make it grow, just say hello
And when you're far from home try to learn from what you see

Come not as concubine, come not as foe
Come with intentions clearly shown

No bigotry, we're hand in hand it ain't a cinch, we make a stand
We learn to live on foreign sand, just say hello

Why do we despise when we can't even speak
We keep on spreading lies
As far as we know it's the only way to be

When times were tough.

You used to strut your stuff.
With a head held high, and a heart so big,
One fist at the sky and shake a leg.

This could be heaven for everyone

So lift up your voice at least you'll have cared
At least you'll have dared
Listen. What people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals

Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone etc.
And this is the end of this section.",Heaven for Everyone
Roger Taylor,"Listen - trapped again
Love on a lead is what you need
Love on a leash is what you wish
Love on a tightrope is what you get

Love on a steep slope you ain't seen nothing yet
When you smile, that wide wide smile
That tiger smile, I'm trapped again
Be my dog, be my pet, like a nervous tic

You just won't quit, like a nervous tic you just won't quit
You don't need a doctor, you need a vet
And when you laugh, your crazy laugh
That wild cat laugh, I'm trapped again

Love on a tightrope, love on a tightrope
Our love's on a steep slope
Love on a tightrope
No don't give up hope ''cause when you wish upon a star

Makes no difference who you are
Don't give up hope our love's on a tightrope
Like a tiger cat you're where it's at
Like a crocodile along the Nile

So strange and wild, some kind of reptile
Love on a lead is what you need
And when you smile, that wide wild smile
That tiger smile, I'm trapped again

Trapped again
They say never bite the hand that feeds
Just one look and my heart bleeds
Love on a tightrope, love on a tightrope

You know, our love's on a steep slope

No don't give up hope, ''cause when you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Brick upon brick, stone upon stone, they grow
Choking the atmosphere, oh, so incredibly slowly
Sulphur and carbon and hydrogen sulphide and lime
Fever, corrosion, and cover your cities with grime

Something is killing the land before your eyes
And the sunshine
Is not to blame
Could be the insane, inhumane games we play
Day by day

Mushrooming home in a crowd, I'm alone

This is KAOS. It's a beautiful, balmy, Southern California summer day. It's 80 degrees ... I said balmy ... I could say bomby ... Ha! Ha! ...O.K. I'm Jim and this is Radio KAOS and with only four minutes left to us, let's use this as wisely as possible. 
Everybody got someone they call home. 
Out at Dodger Stadium. It's the bottom of the seventh, the Dodgers are leading three to nothing over the Giants, and for those of you who are looking to go surfing tomorrow, too bad. 
     (Telephone rings) 
I'm kinda lost in here to tell you the truth ... O.K. good. Ladies and gentlemen, if the reports that we are getting are correct, this could be it. Billy, if you're listening to me, please call now. 

After a near miss on the plane
You swear you'll never fly again
After the first kiss when you make up
You swear you'll never break up again
And when you've just run a red light
Sit shaking under the street light
You swear to yourself you'll never drink and drive again
Sometimes I feel like going home
You swear you'll never let things go by again.
Sometimes I miss the rain and snow
And you'll never toe the party line again
And when the east wind blows
Sometimes I feel like going home

Billy, if you are listening, please call. 
Sole has no eyes. 
Goodbye little spy in the sky. They say that cameras don't lie. Am I happy, am I sad, am I good, am I bad? 
Billy, if you're listening, please call.

Do you really think third-rate military dictators would laugh at America and burn our flag in contempt if Ronald Reagan were president?

These few words may remind you.
We sat here together just to pass time;
You said how the coffee tasted so fine.""

Roger Waters,"Day after day
Love turns gray
Like the skin on a dying man
Night after night
We pretend it's all right
But I have grown older
And you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun, anymore
And I can feel
One of all my turns coming on
I feel
Cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum
Run to the bedroom
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favorite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would you like to see me try?
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?",One of My Turns

In your favorite disguise
With your button-down lips
And your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising
From your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down your door
You better run

Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run

You better run all day
And run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight

Trying to pick her locks

It's a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is slurring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
And mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share

We drove our racing cars

We ate our last few jars of caviar
And somewhere out there in the stars
A keen-eyed look-out
Spied a flickering light

Our last hurrah
And when they found our shadows
Grouped around the TV sets
They ran down every lead

They repeated every test
They checked out all the data on their lists
And then the alien anthropologists
Admitted they were still perplexed

But on eliminating every other reason
For our sad demise
They logged the only explanation left
This species has amused itself to death

No tears to cry no feelings left

""Years later, I saw Bill Hubbard's name on the memorial to the missing
at Aras. And I...when I saw his name I was absolutely transfixed; it
was as though he was now a human being instead of some sort of
nightmarish memory of how I had to leave him, all those years ago.
And I felt relieved, and ever since then I've felt happier about it,
because always before, whenever I thought of him, I said to myself,
'Was there something else that I could have done?' 

""I'd rather die, I'd rather die...""

And that always sort of worried me. And having seen him, and his
name in the register - as you know in the memorials there's a little safe,
there's a register in there with every name - and seeing his name and
his name on the memorial; it sort of lightened my...heart, if you like.""

two or three steps down the trench when I heard a call, 'Hello Razz,
I'm glad to see you. This is my second night here,' and he said 'I'm
feeling bad,' and it was Bill Hubbard, one of the men we'd trained
in England, one of the original battalion. I had a look at his wound,
rolled him over; I could see it was probably a fatal wound. You could
imagine what pain he was in, he was dripping with sweat; and after
I'd gone about three shell holes, traversed that, had it been...had
there been a path or a road I could have done better.  He pummeled
me, 'Put me down, put me down, I'd rather die, I'd rather die, put me
down.' I was hoping he would faint. He said 'I can't go any further,
let me die.' I said 'If I leave you here Bill you won't be found, let's
have another go.' He said 'All right then.' And the same thing
happened; he couldn't stand it any more, and I had to leave him
there, in no-man's-land.""

Roger Waters,"Breathe, breathe in the air.
Don't be afraid to care.
Leave but don't leave me.
Look around and choose your own ground.

Long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be.

Run, rabbit run.
Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave.",Breathe (In the Air)
Roger Waters,"By Roger Waters
You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.

And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest that you've own
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need tothrowaround
So have a good drown, as you go down alone
Dragged down by the stone.

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake of this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out ofthismaze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one had a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to is late the winner
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.

Roger Waters,"Not the torturer will scare me
Nor the body's final fall
Nor the barrels of death's rifles
Nor the shadows on the wall
Nor the night when to the ground
The last dim star of pain, is hurled
But the blind indifference
Of a merciless, unfeeling world

Lying in the burnt out shell
Of some Albanian farm
An old Babushka
Holds a crying baby in her arms
A soldier from the other side
A man of heart and pride
Breaks ranks, lays down his rifle
To kneel by her side

He gives her water
Binds her wounds
And calms the crying child
A touch gives absolution then
Across the great divide
He picks his way back through the broken
China of her life
And there at the curb
The samaritan Serb turns and waves ... goodbye

And each small candle
Lights a corner of the dark
Each small candle
Lights a corner of the dark
Each small candle lights a corner of the dark
When the wheel of pain stops turning
And the branding iron stops burning
When the children can be children
When the desperados weaken
When the tide rolls into greet them
And the natural law of science
Greets the humble and the mighty
And the billion candles burning
Lights the dark side of every human mind

Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
Over the mountain

Breaking the darkness
Waking the grapevine
Knowledge of love is knowledge of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Roger Waters,"Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.

Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught on the cross fire of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger,
You legend, you martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter,
You piper, you prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!","Shine on You Crazy Diamond, Pts. 1-8"
Roger Waters,"They disembarked in '45
And no one spoke and no one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line

And gathered at the cenotaph
They all agreed with hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial knives

But now, she stands upon Southampton dock
With her handkerchief and her summer frock
Clings to her wet body in the rain

In quiet desperation, knuckles white upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again
Oh, Maggie what have you done?

And still the dark stain spreads between
Their shoulder blades
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves

When the fight was over
We spent what they had made, but
In the bottom of our hearts we felt the final cut
",Southhampton Dock
Roger Waters,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
And the sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to nought
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone
The song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire

Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell",Time

Hot ashes for trees?

He fell on his knees and kissed the land
He said something that I did not understand
It was in polish
Then up stepped an aide
He said, I will translate
Here is what His Holiness said:
'I am the Chief Jesuit.'
'This land is Jesus' land.'
'And that is all'
'All that there is to it.'
Hail Mary
Mother of God

And in New York City
The business man in his mohair suit
In the world trade center
Puffs on his cheroot
And he said,
Well I don't care who owns the desert sands
My brief
Is with the hydrocarbons underneath
And the sea of battle rages
Around the ancient tombs
And mother nature licks her wounds
And the lonely boys locked in their towers of faith
Who are nervous in the park
When the gates are closed after dark
Ooooh, the lonely boys
In their towers of faith
Ooooh, the lonely boys
Locked in their towers of faith
",Towers of Faith
Roger Waters,"The child lay 
In the starlit night
Safe in the glow of his Donald Duck light
How strange to choose to take a life
How strange to choose to kill a child
Hoover, Blaupunkt, Nissan Jeep
Nike, Addidas, Lacoste and cheaper brands
Cadillac, Amtrak, gasoline, diesel
Our standard of living, could this be a reason
That we would choose to kill the child
That we would choose to kill the child

Allah, Jehovah, Buddah, Christ
Confucius and Kali and reds, beans and rice
Goujons of sole, ris de veau, ham hocks
Lox bagels and bones and commandments in stone
The Bible, Koran, Shinto, Islam
Prosciutto, risotto, falafel and ham
Is it dogma, doughnuts, ridicule faith
Fear of the dark, or shame or disgrace
That we would choose to kill the child
That we would choose to kill the child

It's cold in the desert
And the space is too big
The rope is too short
And the walls are too thick
I will show you no weakness
I will mock you in song
Berate and deride you 
Belittle and chide you
Beat you with sticks
And bulldoze your home
You can watch my triumphant procession to Rome
Best seat in the house
Up there on the cross
Is it anger or envy, profit or loss
That we would choose to kill the child
That we would choose to kill the child

Take this child and hold him closely
Keep him safe from the holy reign of terror
Take this child hold him closely
Take this child to the moral high ground
Where he can look down on the bigots and bully boys
Slugging it out in the yard",To Kill the Child
Roger Waters,"Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Walking down the street, blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy to make the queen of the angels sigh?

Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
She holds her head so high, like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long,
when she moves my brain screams out this song
Sidewalk crouches at her feet, like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers
Who would hurt the children any way they could
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives",Happiest Days of Our Lives [Live]
Roger Waters,"If I had been God
I would have rearranged the veins in the face to make them more 
Resistant to alcohol and less prone to ageing

If I had been God
I would have sired many sons and I would not have suffered 
The Romans to kill even one of them

If I had been God
With my staff and my rod
If I had been given the nod
I believe I could have done a better job

If I were a drone
Patrolling foreign skies
With my electronic eyes for guidance
And the element of surprise
I would be afraid to find someone home
Maybe a woman at a stove
Baking bread, making rice, or just boiling down some bones
If I were a drone

The bankers get fat
The buffalo's gone
And the mountain top's flat

Counting the cost of love that got lost
And under my Gulf Stream, in circular balls
There's ninety-nine cents worth of drunkards and fools",Déjà Vu
Roger Waters,"There's a mad dog pulling at his chain
A hint of danger in his eye
Alarm bells raging round his brain

Wake up
Wake up and smell the roses
Close your eyes and pray this wind don't change
There's nothing but screams in the field of dreams
Nothing but hope at the end of the road
Nothing but gold in the chimney smoke
Come on honey it's real money

This is the room where they make the explosives
Where they put your name on the bomb
Here's where they bury the buts and the ifs
And scratch out words like right and wrong

Wake up
Wake up and smell the phosphorus
This is the room we keep a human heir
Don't ask, don't tell, it couldn't be lost for us
Yeah, little less cash in the stash in the cupboard
At the bottom of the stair
Money, honey

Wake up
Wake up and smell the bacon
Run your greasy fingers through her hair
This is the life that you have taken

Just a line in the captain's log
Just a whine from a resident dog
Another kid didn't make the grade
Come on honey it's a fair trade

Yeah, now we can forget the threat she poses

Roger Waters,"Are you blowing like a bird in a gale?
Does the pain of your loss seep into your feathers like rain?
Do the bars of your cage feel warm or cold to the touch?

Did I love you too much?

When World War II was over
Though the slate was never wiped clean
We could have picked over them broken bones
We could have been free
But we chose to adhere to abundance
We chose the American Dream
And oh mistress liberty
How we abandoned thee
How we abandoned thee
And oh Mistress Liberty
How we abandoned thee

Could have been born in Shreveport
Or he could have born in Tehran
It don't much matter wherever you're born
Little babies mean us no harm
They have to be taught to despise us
To bulldoze our homes to the ground
To believe their fight is for liberty
To believe their God will keep them safe and sound
Safe and sound
Safe and sound

We cannot turn back the clock
Cannot go back in time
But we can say ""fuck you"" we will not listen to
Your bullshit and lies

Roger Waters,"So, as an example, you're CNN
I mean it's story, after story, after story is bad
I won, I won
And the other thing, chaos, there's zero chaos
We are running, this is a fine-tuned mach

The goose has gotten fat
On caviar in fancy bars
And subprime loans
And broken homes
Is this the life, the holy grail?
It's not enough that we succeed
We still need others to fail

Fear, fear drives the mills of modern man
Fear keeps us all in line
Fear of all those foreigners
Fear of all their crimes
Is this the life we really want? (want, want, want, want)
It surely must be so
For this is a democracy and what we all say goes

And every time a student is run over by a tank
And every time a pirate's dog is forced to walk the plank
Every time a Russian bride is advertised for sale
And every time a journalist is left to rot in jail
Every time a young girl's life is casually spent
And every time a nincompoop becomes the president
Every time somebody dies reaching for their keys
And every time that Greenland falls in the fucking sea is because
All of us, the blacks and whites
Chicanos, Asians, every type of ethnic group
Even folks from Guadeloupe, the old, the young
Toothless hags, super models, actors, fags, bleeding hearts
Football stars, men in bars, washerwomen, tailors, tarts
Grandmas, grandpas, uncles, aunts
Friends, relations, homeless tramps
Clerics, truckers, cleaning ladies
Ants, maybe not ants
Why not ants?
Well because it's true
The ants don't have enough IQ to differentiate between
The pain that other people feel
And well, for instance, cutting leaves
Or crawling across windowsills in search of open treacle tins
So, like the ants, are we just dumb?
Is that why we don't feel or see?
Or are we all just numbed out on reality TV?

So, every time the curtain falls
Every time the curtain falls on some forgotten life
It is because we all stood by, silent and indifferent
It's normal",Is This the Life We Really Want?
Roger Waters,"She may well have been
The most beautiful girl in the world
Her life snuffed out
Like a bulldozer crushing a pearl

The secret committee
Deep in its lair
Conveniently far
From the cold desert air
Puts a tick in a box
Turns the key in a lock
To loosen the bonds in her hair

Sleep if you can
Wrapped safe in your cloak
The tumbledown twilight
Havana smoke
Caught in your throat
Mistress Liberty's dance
Held you in its trance
Her bosoms were loaded with nectar and lances
""Well, boys,"" she said
""You have broken the trust
Hold on to that stick if you must""

Take a fresh grip
On the crucible rune
The patchwork of ashes
Sweeps away love like a broom
Madness comes down
Like the crackpot of ages
The raging of angels
Cathedral of stars
Christopher Robin says
""Alice, go home now
They're no longer changing the guard""

""Hold on,"" she said
""You're breaking my heart""
It's weird how the steel rails
Disappear into the dark
They clung to the ivory tower on her braids
They were never afraid of falling
But the bomb hit the spot where the numbers all stop
And the last thing they heard was her calling...

Roger Waters,"She was always here in my heart
Always the love of my life
We were strangers, oceans apart
But when I laid eyes on her 
A part of me died",Oceans Apart
Roger Waters,"The part that is envious, cold hearted and devious
Greedy, mischievous, global, colonial
Bloodthirsty, blind, mindless and cheap
Focused on borders and slaughter and sheep 
Burning of books, bulldozing of homes 
Given to targeted killing with drones 
Lethal injections, arrest without trial

Monocular vision, gangrene and slime
Unction, sarcasm, common assault
Self-satisfied heroic killers
Lifted on high

Piracy adverts, acid attacks
On women by bullies and perverts and hacks
The rigging of ballots and the buying of power

Lies from the pulpit
Rape in the shower
Mute, indifferent
Feeling no shame
Portly, important
Leering, deranged

Sat in the corner watching TV
Deaf to the cries of children in pain
Dead to the world
Just watching the game

Watching endless repeats out of sight, out of mind
Silence, indifference
The ultimate crime
But when I met you, that part of me died

Bring me a bowl to bathe her feet in
Bring me my final cigarette
It would be better by far to die in her arms than to linger
In a lifetime of regret",Part of Me Died
Roger Waters,"Picture yourself as you lean on the port rail
Tossing away your last cigarette
Picture your finger pushing the doorbell
Picture the skull and crossbones on the doormat
Picture yourself on the streets of Laredo
Picture the Casbah, picture Japan
Picture your kid with his hand on the trigger
Picture prosthetics in Afghanistan
Picture a courthouse with no fucking laws
Picture a cathouse with no fucking whores
Picture a shithouse with no fucking drains
Picture a leader with no fucking brains
No fucking brains, no fucking brains
No fucking brains, no fucking brains
No fucking brains, no fucking brains
No fucking brains, no fucking brains

Follow me filming myself at the show
On a phone from a seat in the very front row
Follow Miss Universe catching some rays
Wish You Were Here in Guantanamo Bay
Picture a seat on a private plane
Picture your feet nailed to the floor
Picture a crew who are clearly insane
Picture no windows, picture no doors
Glued to a screen in the state of Nevada
To follow the dream gets harder and harder

Picture her wrapping a gift for the wedding
Picture her boiling the water for tea
Picture the kids climbing into the backseat
Picture my hand turning the key
Oh, picture that
Picture the dog in the pickup ahead
Picture the tree at the side of the road
Picture my hands growing steadily colder
Colder, colder
Colder, colder
Colder, colder
Colder, colder

Sold for my kidneys, sold for my liver
Why so weedy, so fucking needy
There’s no such thing as being too greedy",Picture That
Roger Waters,"With a glass inlaid with gemstones
On a pool around the evening
Among the perfumed roses

With the patience of a packhorse 
Loaded for the mountains
Like a stoic, noble prince
Wait for her

With seven pillows laid out on the stair
The scent of womens' incense fills the air
Be calm, and wait for her

And do not flush the sparrows 
That are nesting in her braids
All along the barricades
Wait for her

And if she comes soon
Wait for her
And if she comes late
Wait

Let her be still as a summer afternoon
A garden in full bloom

Let her breathe in the air 
That is foreign to her heart
Let her lips part
Wait for her

Take her to the balcony, see the moon soaked in milk
Hear the rustle of her silk
Wait for her

Don't let your eyes alight upon the twin doves of her breast
Lest they take flight
Wait for her

And if she comes soon
Wait for her
And if she comes late
Wait

Serve her water before wine
Do not touch her hand
Let your fingertips rest as her command

Roger Whittaker,"""Dear God, you made many, many poor people.
I realize, of course, that it's no shame to be poor.
But it's no great honor either!
So, what would have been so terrible if I had a small fortune?""

If I were a rich man,
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.
If I were a wealthy man.
I wouldn't have to work hard.
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
If I were a biddy biddy rich,
Yidle-diddle-didle-didle man.

I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen,
Right in the middle of the town.
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below.
There would be one long staircase just going up,
And one even longer coming down,
And one more leading nowhere, just for show.

I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese and ducks
For the town to see and hear, squawking just as noisly as they can
And each loud ""cheep"" and ""swaqwk"" and ""honk"" and ""quack""
Would land like a trumpet on the ear,
As if to say ""Here lives a wealthy man.""

If I were a biddy biddy rich,

I see my wife, my Golde, looking like a rich man's wife
With a proper double-chin.
Supervising meals to her heart's delight.
I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock.
Oy, what a happy mood she's in.
Screaming at the servants, day and night.

The most important men in town would come to fawn on me!
They would ask me to advise them,
Like a Solomon the Wise.
""If you please, Reb Tevye...""
""Pardon me, Reb Tevye...""
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes!
And it won't make one bit of difference if i answer right or wrong.
When you're rich, they think you really know!

If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray.
And maybe have a seat by the Eastern wall.
And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men, several hours every day.
That would be the sweetest thing of all.

But the old ship's gone away

Back on the banks that old horn's sounding

A little I'll do what I must do

That would roll up by the mountains
As she took us through the storm
I know they've got to take her

To live without a trace of grieve
To be a child once again
And never, never more the same

And we sing Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah

And so, and so the day is done
The child once more peacefully sleeping
The sun has set upon the world
Is watch of love peacefully keeping

Have we just past the time away?
Have we just lost ourselves in play?
Have we begun to live again
Like children's never more the same?

Roger Whittaker,"Christmas was coming and Darcy the dragon
Was thinking what he should do
Go through the forest and into the village
To pick up a gift or two

For through the forest, dear Darcy had friends
That he loved very much
He thought it'd be fine, at Christmas time
To give each a present or such

But Darcy'd forgotten the very thing
That makes a dragon unique
Unlike a horse, a dragon, of course
Breathes fire whenever he speaks

Off to town, dear Darcy went
But woe is me, oh lament
Before a dragon penny was spent
He'd started a tiny fire

He said he was sorry, our Darcy did
He helped put the fire out
The folks forgave him for he'd been kind
And off he went looking about

Into the toyshop did Darcy go
With thoughts of his forest friends
""I'll buy each a game"", he said with a flame
And the second fire it was then

And this time, when the fire was out
The villagers charged along
Pursuing Darcy with angry shouts
'Be off, away, be gone!'

Poor Darcy sparked, ""No harm I meant""
But from the village, he was sent
And woe is me and oh lament
No presents for his friends

Darcy was sad
As he sat at the edge of the forest, by and by
No gifts would he have to offer his friends
A tear rolled from his eye

A storm did gather and soon did hit
'Twas a mighty wind that blew
And Christmas snow did whirl and blow
And he wondered what to do

As Darcy let out with a dragon's cry
He opened his mouth so wide
That the wind and snow went right down his throat
And put out the fire inside

When Darcy realized the fire was out
First a whisper, then a shout
And a laugh, to know
That he could speak without starting another fire

But now it was late, on a Christmas Eve
He was up and off with a roar
He raced to the village and he cried out
""My fire! 'e un no more""

From shop to shop, he then did go
In each, he made his choice
Darcy was treated so kindly now
No need to fear his voice

The villagers came to the edge of town
And Darcy waved goodbye
""Come back again, if ever you can"", they said
And he said that he'd try

Merry Christmas, all did say
As to the woods, he made his way
Tomorrow will be Christmas day
And a merry Christmas to thee",Darcy the Dragon

To grant whatever you would crave,
I have both wagered life and land,

It does the more enrapture me,
And even so, I still remain

And they did ever wait on thee;
All this was gallant to be seen,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

Thou couldst desire no earthly thing,
But still thou hadst it readily.
Thy music still to play and sing;
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

Well, I will pray to God on high,
That thou my constancy mayst see,
And that yet once before I die,
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.

Come once again and love me.

Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
My ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return home safe again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell",The Last Farewell

Roger Whittaker,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
And you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love
Really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh but now old friends they're acting strange
And they shake their heads
And they tell me that I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow

With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where

Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

So on we go
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with gladness
And love for one another

It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share

You fill up my senses, come fill me again.

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you,
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you.
Come, let me love you, come love me again.

Roger Whittaker,"Love, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love, ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two
You and I will
Make each night the first
Everyday a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun
Time, we've learned to sail above
Time, won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen",Evergreen

I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

Roger Whittaker,"It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength.
A beautiful face without a name, for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be
If I can fly higher than an eagle
You are the wind beneath my wings
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth
Of course I know it
I would be nothing with out you

Fly, fly, fly away
You let me fly so high
Oh, fly, fly
So high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky

Roger Whittaker,"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen",Your Song

Dies ist Gordon McKenzies Lied.
Sein Lied von Albany
Dem stolzen Schloß seines Clans
Das er eines Tages für immer verlieren sollte.


Albany - Hoch in den Bergen von Northern Green
Albany - in Deinen Mauern war ich einst zu Hause
Albany - Schloß meiner Väter, das ich geliebt
Ach könnt ich Dich nur einmal wiedersehen!


Charles und Gordon waren zwei Brüder
Sangen als Kinder die gleichen Lieder
Jagten gemeinsam in den Wäldern


Doch aus Bruderliebe und Freundschaft
Wurde eines Tages bitt're Feindschaft
Als sie sahn:
Sie liebten beide dasselbe Mädchen


(Ref.)


Charles und Gordon waren zwei Brüder
Man sagte einer stach den andren nieder
Doch ihren fairen Kampf sah keiner

Wie ein Mörder mußte Gordon fliehen
Kein McKenzie hat ihm je verziehen
Rastlos zieht er nun umher
Und findet keinen Frieden

Roger Whittaker,"I cried a tear
You wiped it dry
I was confused
You cleared my mind
I sold my soul
You bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me.

You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me
You needed me

And I can't believe it's you 
I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave
I'd be a fool
Cause I've finally found someone 
Who really cares

You held my hand
When it was cold
When I was lost
You took me home
You gave me hope
When I was at the end
And turned my lies
Back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again

Roger Whittaker,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air.

Roger Whittaker,"""Dear God, you made many, many poor people.
I realize, of course, that it's no shame to be poor.
But it's no great honor either!
So, what would have been so terrible if I had a small fortune?""

I wouldn't have to work hard.

If I were a biddy biddy rich,
Yidle-diddle-didle-didle man.

I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen,
Right in the middle of the town.
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below.
There would be one long staircase just going up,
And one even longer coming down,
And one more leading nowhere, just for show.

I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese and ducks
For the town to see and hear.
And each loud ""cheep"" and ""swaqwk"" and ""honk"" and ""quack""
Would land like a trumpet on the ear,
As if to say ""Here lives a wealthy man.""

I see my wife, my Golde, looking like a rich man's wife
With a proper double-chin.
Supervising meals to her heart's delight.
I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock.
Oy, what a happy mood she's in.
Screaming at the servants, day and night.

The most important men in town would come to fawn on me!
They would ask me to advise them,
Like a Solomon the Wise.
""If you please, Reb Tevye...""
""Pardon me, Reb Tevye...""
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes!
And it won't make one bit of difference if i answer right or wrong.
When you're rich, they think you really know!

If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray.
And maybe have a seat by the Eastern wall.
And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men, several hours every day.
That would be the sweetest thing of all.

Roger Whittaker,"I once heard a song about a lemon tree
It was alright, it was alright
It told of the flower and the tree and the fruit
It was alright, it was all the truth

Now the lemon is surely sour
And the mango is surely sweet
And we couldn't tell one from the other
But they both make life complete

I talk about life throws you a lot of lemons
Life throws you a lot of lemons
You have to learn how to make lemonade
Or you won't make the grade

You talk about life throws you a lot of lemons
Life throws you a lot of lemons
You have to learn how to make lemonade
Or you'll be sour all your days
I said life, I, I, I

You're gonna live your life or you're gonna die
That's a fact, that's a fact
While livin' your life you can laugh or cry
That's a fact, that's a fact

The choice is up to you
But I know what I would do
Well, I'd rather be happy than sad
If I had the choice I'd be glad

You talk about life throws you a lot of lemons
Life throws you a lot of lemons
You have to learn how to make lemonade
Or you'll be sour all your days
I said life, I, I, I

You have to learn how to make lemonade
Or you'll be sour all your days

Or you'll be sour all your days

When laden down with sadness

We run to when we fall
Two loving arms tenderly hold you close
Soft words of comfort you recall

Stays in you mind forever

Lives in your heart forever

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Said all the boys are fighting for her

Sayin', ""Oh, my true love are you well?""

Rings on her fingers, bells on her toes

If she doesn't get the fella with the roving eye

Let the wind and the rain and the gale blow high
And the snow come tumblin' from that sky
She's as nice as apple pie

When she gets a lad of her own
She won't tell her ma when she gets home
Let them all come as they will

I realize, of course, that it's no shame to be poor.
But it's no great honor either!

I wouldn't have to work hard.
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
If I were a biddy biddy rich,
Yidle-diddle-didle-didle man.

I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen,
Right in the middle of the town.
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below.
There would be one long staircase just going up,
And one even longer coming down,
And one more leading nowhere, just for show.

I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese and ducks
For the town to see and hear.
And each loud ""cheep"" and ""swaqwk"" and ""honk"" and ""quack""
Would land like a trumpet on the ear,
As if to say ""Here lives a wealthy man.""

With a proper double-chin.
Supervising meals to her heart's delight.
I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock.
Oy, what a happy mood she's in.
Screaming at the servants, day and night.

The most important men in town would come to fawn on me!
They would ask me to advise them,
Like a Solomon the Wise.
""If you please, Reb Tevye...""
""Pardon me, Reb Tevye...""
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes!
And it won't make one bit of difference if i answer right or wrong.
When you're rich, they think you really know!

If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray.
And maybe have a seat by the Eastern wall.
And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men, several hours every day.
That would be the sweetest thing of all.

Love will turn your world around, and that world will last forever.
Yes, love, love changes everything, brings you glory, brings you shame.

Roger Whittaker,"Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by

If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

Roger Whittaker,"Somewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight

Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there

And even though I know
How very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind
Starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

And even though I know
How very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
on the same bright star

And when the night wind
Starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Roger Whittaker,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you",When I Fall in Love
Roger Whittaker,"The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay tending their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They look?d up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie
One entered it them for to see
And found the Babe in poverty

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Then entered in those Wise Men three
Full reverently upon the knee
And offered there, in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Between an ox stall and an ass
This Child truly there He was
For want of clothing they did Him lay
All in a manger, among the hay

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made heaven and earth of naught
And with His blood mankind hath bought

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

If we in our time shall do well
We shall be free from death and hell
For God hath prepared for us all
A resting place in general

Roger Whittaker,"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay;
Remember Christ, our Savior,
Was born on Christmas day,
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Jewry,
This blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger,
Upon this blessed morn;
That which His Mother Mary,
Did nothing take in scorn.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

From God our Heavenly Father,
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

""Fear not,"" then said the Angel,
""let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Savior
Of pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding,
In tempest, storm, and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.

Comfort and joy,

As the leaves grow on the tree

She placed her snow-white hand

And now am full of tears

The butterfly aeroplanes land on a runway of roses

And the policemen cockroaches are standing by watching the fun
I hear three bluebells ringing in a steeple of heather & roses
I can hear them so clear as I glide by on dragonfly wings
And the gamekeeper fairy who lives in a mushroom nearby

Plays a lute made of pinewood & oak and plucks cotton wool strings
The last of the sun rays are leaving the floor of the wild wood
As the phantom black beetle arrives on the wings of the bat
The grasshopper coachmen are harnessing mice to my carriage

And the four coach light fireflies are put into place by the rat

where water ne'er sprung nor drop of rain fell
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Have her find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the sea foam and over the sand
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Plow the land with the horn of a lamb
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Then sow some seeds from north of the dam
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And then she'll be a true love of mine

If she tells me she can't, I'll reply
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Let me know that at least she will try
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Love imposes impossible tasks
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Though not more than any heart asks
And I must know she's a true love of mine

Dear, when thou has finished thy task
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Come to me, my hand for to ask
For thou then art a true love of mine",Scarborough Fair Canticle
Roger Whittaker,"Wenn's dich mal wieder erwischt
Weil ein Feuer der Liebe erlischt
Weil der and're verrückt spielt und alles zerbricht
Dann verfluch' nicht den Tag
Denn das hilft dir nicht.
Tauch hinab in die Nacht
Vergiß den Tag
Der dir nichts als nur Enttäuschung gebracht.
Laß dich treiben I'm Boot deiner Träume
Bis ein schönerer Morgen für dich erwacht.
Denn wenn do träumst bist do frei
Keiner hindert dich dabei
Und das Ziel deiner Reise kennst do allein.

Und kein Schmerz dringt mehr in deine Seele ein.
Dein Herz wird unverwundbar sein

Wenn es ernst war
Ganz genauso gemacht.

Es könnte sein
Dann fahren wir ein Stück zu zwein.
Und aufeinmal träumst do nicht mehr allein.

Gleaming in the evening sky
I must confess, I’d always hoped
Today would pass me by

Oh dad, I really hate to see
The sadness in your eyes
We always knew this day would come
It can’t be a surprise

We had a special day together
You were always my best friend
But the princess and the old king
Knew this day would end

A perfect day, a perfect day with you
Just a perfect day of perfect hours, no other word would do
A perfect day, a day for you and I
Now the evening shadows chill my heart and I can’t say goodbye

It was always I who said, ""I’ll see you soon""
When you were young
So many things we left unsaid
So many songs unsung

Dad, don’t worry now I’m grown
It’ll be okay
You taught me well, so trust me now
And I’ll be on my way

We had a special day together
You were always my best friend
But the princess and the old king
Knew this day would end

A perfect day, a perfect day with you
Just a perfect day of perfect hours, no other word would do
A perfect day, a day for you and I
Now the evening shadows chill my heart and I can’t say goodbye

A perfect day, a day for you and I
Now the evening shadows chill my heart and I can’t say
I’m leaving home, goodbye

Roger Whittaker,"There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor
Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
My ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return home safe again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly

Roger Willemsen,"When I was young I lived in a world of dreams
Of moods and myths and illusionary schemes
Though now I'm much more grown up
I fear that I must own up
To the fact that I'm in doubt of
What the modern cynics shout of

They say it's spring
This feeling light as a feather
They say this thing
This magic we share together
Came with the weather too

They say it's May
That's made me daft as a daisy
It's May, they say
That gave the whole world this crazy
Heavenly, hazy hue

I'm a lark
On the wing
I'm the spark of a firefly's fling

Yet to me
This must be
Something more than a seasonal thing

Could it be spring
Those bells that I can hear ringing
It may be spring
But when the robins stop singing
You're what I'm clinging to
Though they say it's spring
It's you

If poets sing
That when a hard sympathetic
It's merely spring
Then poets plights are pathetic
Though I'm poetic too

They say it's spring
For lovers, there's where the lure is
That evil thing
For which September the cure is
This, they are sure is true

Though I know
That it's so
That my fancy may turn in the spring

With the right
One in sight
One can find a perpetual thing

Did I need spring
To bring the ring that you bought me
Though it was spring
That wondrous day that you caught me

Darling I thought we knew
That it wasn't spring
'Twas you",They Say It's Spring

Jack Frost nipping at your nose

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Roger Williams,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Knows that I have to be

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

Wandering the night, 
What were the chances

Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello

Roger Williams,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list

So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
     
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes I'm saving all my love

But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove

Rohan Reid,"Since I met you I've begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name (that's funny)
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don't know what to do
 
Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you
 
Could it be I'm falling in love (witcha baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (ooh)
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you, with you  with you, with you
 
I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy
You made me such a happy boy
And honey you'll always be the only one for me
Meeting you was my destiny
You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me I will be around
And darling you'll always be the only one for me
Heaven made you specially

[Chorus] 
 
Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you
 
[Chorus]
 
Could it be I'm falling in love",Could It Be I'm Falling in Love
Rohff,"Mon coeur, mes poumons, mon ventre forment un triangle de douleur
Je sais pas ce que j'ai, je souffre de toute ma couleur
Toute ma vie, toute mon âme, tout va mal dans ma famille
Je vois plus mon fils, je ne peux retenir mes larmes quand je prie
J'ai de quoi manger ou dormir, je suis pas handicapé
J'ai perdu l'appétit, l'envie bloqué sur mon canapé
Épuisé, j'ai puisé trop d'énergie
J'ai nagé trop loin et les vagues m'empêchent d'émerger
Le succès écorché vif, mes oreilles sifflent
Comme si je leur faisais du mal parce que j'ai réussi
Ma position nécessite beaucoup de self control
Je suis pas né ici, ma franchise fait que je suis seul contre eux
Malheureux mais vaillant, et valeureux
Quand tu perds confiance en toi, et que t'es mal tombé amoureux
Dieu, aide moi, Dieu aime moi, Dieu, protège moi, préserve moi
Le diable me harcèle, je prends sur moi-même
Dégouté de la société du show biz' et de leurs soirées mondaines
J'ignore le rap game, je bicrave mes trophées
En train d'étouffer, l'impression d'avoir tout fait

Jour et nuit, j'ai mal à la vie
J'assume mes choix, ce que je suis
Ma chute fera le bonheur de mes ennemis
Je perds mes forces, qu'est-ce qui m'arrive
Chacun son épreuve, riches ou appauvris
De tout ce qui me manque, tout ce que je brille
Dieu m'éprouve mais j'ai confiance en lui
Je suis déçu de l'homme, des coeurs pourris

Pour les frères et soeurs enfermés, prends ton mal en patience
T'as l'esprit en cavale, est-ce que la justice a un sens?
En séquestrant l'existence, les faibles cachetonnent l'espoir
À en perdre leurs sens, habités par les fantômes du parloir
On t'ouvre la cage après t'avoir coupé les ailes
Démerde toi compte pas sur eux pour dédommager tes séquelles
On devient ce qu'on endure, incarnation de la rancoeur
Tes sentiments se prennent des mur, tellement il fait noir dans les coeurs

Usé d'y croire, l'homme sait plus quoi faire pour recevoir
Accoutumé à donner sans jamais recevoir
A faire plus que mon devoir, incompris
Comme les symptômes de tueurs en série assombris
Par l'inceste, le manque d'affection, le mépris
La frustration d'un enterré vivant qui crie sa survie
Si tu m'entends dans ta dépression, faut relativiser
Vois par les yeux du tiers monde ou de ceux qui ont l'avenir paralysé

Tous déséquilibrés, a des degrés différents
Certains renfermés sur eux-même ont perdu la clef
Le goût de la vie peu fruité, on voit le bonheur en crypté
L'entourage n'a pas le réseau pour capter
Le nombre d'amis se réduit au fur et à mesure
Je me retrouve seul avec ma plume au fil des mesures
L'impression qu'on me bloque le passage sur terre
Les jours nous creusent et les années nous enterrent
Toi qui viens de perdre un être cher
Qui encaisses sans jamais rendre la monnaie, gère
C'est ton coeur qui mange et le temps qui digère
Souffre en silence comme un sourd muet, gère
Pour ceux qui ont touché le fond de la bouteille, et qui se roulent dans leur gerbe
Les problèmes servis sur un plateau d'argent, en mal d'amour et d'argent, c'est urgent
Sèche tes larmes, si la douleur te transporte prends le volant
Plus brave que poser une lame sur l'avant bras et jouer du violon
Comme un arbre en automne, je perds mes moyens à toutes les saisons
Plus rien ne m'étonne, du bout de la foi je retiens la raison

Victime d'être conscient, victime des passions
Relativise, Dieu est avec les patients
Victime d'être conscient, victime des passions
Relativise, Dieu est avec les patients",Mal à La Vie
Rohff,"On va pas sucer pour voir exaucer nos exigences
Se contenter d'insuffisance, faire la manche on braque notre chance
La pauvreté rabaisse notre dignité
Invité à débattre soi-disant sur un pied d'égalité
On sortira de ce marasme en développant nos facultés
Ma bouche pleine de vérités, j'ai même plus de place pour les insulter
C'est l'insécurité pour la police de proximité
J'exprime le malaise de la jeunesse en difficulté

Constatez les dommages du chômage, sans réponse comme nos démarches
Y'a que pour les victimes de cet engrenage qu'on marche
Hommage aux familles de Clichy-sous-bois, Villiers et Marseille
Marche sur la patte du coq et la BAC te réveille
J’annonce la météo du moral, caniculaire, sanguinaire, suicidaire
Petit frère aimerait faire des choses, mais le manque de père, de moyens le perd
Les gardes à vue sont pleines à en faire craquer les commissaires
Les cars cellulaires les déferlent, la JLD les enferme
La prison un ovule, on y entre comme du sperme, car les poucaves ont chécra
Dans cette chaîne de justice, qui accouchera de portées de gros youvois
La rue veut son biff', du guetteur au passeur au dealer, au braqueur, receleur, racketteur, carotteur
Quoi faire sans diplôme ni talent ni physique
Les frères muz' raisonnent les frères qui s'amusent, que Dieu nous guide
Leurs vices dévissés, je suis l'anti-reflet du miroir brisé par leurs mensonges déguisés, maîtrisés
Ne cautionne pas mais comprends pourquoi leurs textes nous touchent pas
L'illicite a ses raisons que la loi ne connaît pas

Mon rap reste contestataire, crise sociale, crise identitaire
L'expression du malaise
Comme une femme on se débat pour pas se faire violer par l'État
L'expression du malaise
C'est rempli de condés et de radars, rend les fous, te laisse pas hagar
L'expression du malaise
Engagé, quitte à finir à l'ombre, finir en sang, les voitures en cendres
L'expression du malaise

Hey yo je sors du trou, pourtant j'ai fait mon trou
Je peux te faire un deuxième trou, on rentre et quitte ce monde par un trou
À travers mon son ressens mon pouls, tant que le cœur bat il en faudra beaucoup
La peine planché t'attend à la sortie du dernier coup
Trop de vitriots candidats au suicide de braco
Rêvant de partir en martyrs aux paradis fiscaux
Aucune compassion pour Sarko, tout comme lui la hass
Veut son yacht, son mannequin et sa rolex
On se moque de ses menaces et de ses promesses
Je me fait pas le baveux du diable, à vrai dire c'est complexe
Mais je reste optimiste pour mes frères et soeurs
Ils parlent de réparer la France, qu'ils commencent par l'ascenceur
Il paraît qu'y a moyen d'être docteur ou avocat
Essaye d'expliquer ça aux frères sous Skunk et Vodka
Prends pas les marginaux pour des cons, les michtos pour des hmara
La joie de vivre a le sourire jaune comme Fadela Amara
Les administrations prennent leur temps pour se mettre en mouvement
Comment cracher sur la main de la rue dans les sables mouvants
Nique son père l'État
Ne cautionne pas mais comprends pourquoi leurs textes nous touchent pas
L'illicite a ses raisons que la loi ne connaît pas

Ils veulent me visser un silencieux à la bouche pour qu'on m'entende pas
Que ces cocus d'hommes d'État se couchent
On survivra si on ne vit pas, on s'aimera s'ils nous aiment pas
Tant qu'on se comprend on assumera s'ils nous comprennent pas
On la mettra même si l'avenir ne mouille pas
Rien de dangereux sur nous à part nos couilles, nous fouille pas
Tu finis au placard si tu te grouilles pas, clochard si tu te débrouilles pas
On est des mecs en or et tu sais que l'or ne rouille pas
Si la rue s'arrête le ghetto ne graille pas, l'épicier ne maille pas
Le train de vie roule sur ma voie et ne déraille pas
Toujours nous contre eux
Je ferme les yeux, je fonce dans le tas
Mon son explose parmi vous c'est un attentat
La violence est en cloque, leur pilule ne passe pas
Parmi nous des crapules, comme parmi eux des Pasqua
Nique les vendus adeptes des milieux huppés
N'essaie pas de nous duper, ton rap pue l'UMP
C'est pas du hardcore de bon chic bon genre
On se mélange pas, on crache sur votre image et tout votre argent
Gardez vos leçons de vie y a plus sure-cen
Génération perchée en sens interdit sur les Champs
Pied au plancher, fiché, recherché
En légitime défense les moutons ont sauté sur le berger

Rohff,"Qui qui est dans la plazza?
Qué qué Passa?
Oulala, mais c'est quoi ça?

Sortez les calculettes c'est le son des gros chiffres, des grosses gifles
T'as les joues en sang tu comprends pas ce qu'il t'arrive
Je veux pas qu'on joue ensemble, associable comme mon fils
J'attends aucune reconnaissance du showbiz (aie aie aie)
Ton rap est trop peace, le mien sans pitié
J'ai mon plan, vois moi comme l'architecte qu'a construit ton quartier
Kamikaze comme les japs sur Pearl Harbor
Mon stylo s'affole comme les aiguilles de mon tableau de bord
J'ai poussé mon premier cri, en pleine lune sous l’équateur
Ma vengeance est fraîchement sortie du congélateur
J'ai qu'un visage, plutôt révélateur, j'ai beau être fédérateur
Je peux pas aimer tout le monde j'ai qu'un cœur
Ils ont peur, je vais les traumatiser
Un loup dans une bergerie, quand je roule sur les Champs-Elysée

Trop fiers, trop vrais, on est plus des chiens de la casse
Ni ton boul' ni ton oseille ne peuvent atteindre la grande classe
Je suis en mode avec les re-frè (TLF!), quand on arrive on prend toute la place
Qu'on soit libre ou au frais, on meurt et vit avec la grande classe (la classe)

Je suis un pilote de ligne de conduite
Ce qui est rare est cher donc leur musique devrait etre gratuite
Hermétique au star-system, j'ai les piles du rap-game
C'est le concentré des caractères des banlieues parisiennes
Scotché au pavé, on est fait pour taffer, tout raffler, te baffer et braver les obstacles
J'te tacle au coup, j'assure le spectacle
Ceux qui veulent clash sont fous, doivent fumer du crack
Je crache ma couleur dans ta radio comme dans une babtou
Pose mes boules sur la table, les trimballe partout
Je dis non a tout, je suis le berger de mes thunes
J'ai beau me brosser la langue, mon haleine sent le tube
Ces paroles sont fières de sortir de ma bouche
Comme une groupie de ma douche
Ou un merco d'un camps de manouche
Les teubs changent de bouche pour l'ouverture
Tout le monde tire la couverture
Aucune somme aucun boul' ne me perturbe

Trop fiers, trop vrais, on est plus des chiens de la casse
Ni ton boul' ni ton oseille ne peuvent atteindre la grande classe
Je suis en mode avec les re-frè (TLF!), quand on arrive on prend toute la place

J'ai pas changé, fuck ceux qui m'aiment pas
J'baisse pas mon froc mais le remonte jusqu'aux pecs comme Papa Wemba
Ils comprennent pas pourquoi j'suis sur de moi
Ils disent des choses sur moi, les gens comptent sur moi
Et moi je prends sur moi 
J'ai fait d'un squat là où personne ne m'attend
Ici ne rentrent que les thugs, loins des keufs qui veulent nous entendre
Mon univers n'est qu'un repère de vrais
Plus plus plus spontané qu'un tueur-né, dangereusement frais
Le plus titré le plus jalousé toujours posé
En train de bosser, pas le temps de causer ni de se reposer
Mais disposé à t'exploser, son de névrosés, le plus diffusé, v'là les télés que j'ai refusé, 
Moins exposé. La gloire me court après et veut m'épouser
C'est pas l'année des moutons ni des mythos mais du Comoriano
Flow flow flow technicien comme Christiano
Mon son une catastrophe naturelle (Hous!), j'rappe en conditionnelle (Hous!)
La liberté j'vais lui mettre, jusqu'au bout du tunnel. Housni!

Rohff,"Hysteric love, se termine toujours mal
Le charme nous fait décollé mais on atterri toujours mal
Des façons de m'aimer, y en n'a pas 50
soit tu m'aimes à la folie, ou tu aimes mon compte en banque.. Mademoiselle
J'ai plus la cote que mon oseille
Mieux qu'un jean slim
Je fais mouler ton cœur si tu m'essaye
Celles qui l'ont fait l'ont pas l'air d'avoir digéré
Faut gérer, quand l'amour prend trop de poids, on fini par se déchirer
à trop se désirer, on prend plus le temps de se plaire
la canicule laisse toujours présagé des éclairs
on zappe le meilleur pour dire le pire
les mots dépasse les pensés, plus on y croit, plus sa empire

Trop faux pour être frais, entre trahison et blessures
Trop beau pour être vrai, trop classe pour que sa dure

J'ai beau souffrir mais mon coeur revient vers toi
Et je me hais de t'aimer comme ça
(Opposition de vécu, de caractère, quand les sentiments, ce font la guerre)
J'ai beau pleurer je fini dans tes bras
je ne veux plus de cette hystérique love

J'aborde ce thème en connaissance de cause
Mon expérience de vie démontre que l'amour n'est pas si rose
Hysteric love fout le mal de vivre
Ce n'est que l'effet de la société dans laquelle nous sommes contraint de vivre
Des larmes se délivrent, ivre, ton cœur ouvert comme un livre
J'ai pu lire entre les griffures ce qu'il t'arrive
Ne me dis pas que tu vas à la dèche sur le coup de la rage
Les yeux tristes, la routine te conduira chez le fleuriste
Quand l'Hysteric Love craque
De violentes disputes éclatent
Des portables qui se cassent
Une mauvaise insulte, une claque
Une porte qui claque
Au milieu de la nuit
Si tu ressens sa douleur
Va la chercher sous la pluie
Si tes jugements et ses regrets la torture
Dis lui, que c'est comme de l'or enfoui dans des ordures
Je te rassure, t'es pas le seul a vivre ça
Bien sur qu'on mérite mieux mais quand le cœur est brisé comme ça

Tu me rends folle. (Hysteric love)
J'ai beau souffrir mais mon cœur revient vers toi
Et je me hais de t'aimer comme ça
(Opposition de vécu, de caractère, quand les sentiments, ce font la guerre)
J'ai beau pleurer je fini dans tes bras
je ne veux plus de cette hystérique love

Hysteric love se retrouve au tribunal.
Passionnel est le crime, les ruptures font trop mal
La bande original, des lovers en série.
Est-ce que plus belle est la vie de Bertand sans Marie
Hysteric love est trop louche, se reconcilie au lit
Repars au clash après la douche, comme une maladie
Et à l'usure provoque l'infidélité
Un moyen de bifurquer quand on à peine à se quitter
Hysteric love veut s'écarter, trop de fierté.
qui va rappeler, cracker, se faire larguer, ravaler tout ces ""je t'aime""
Crier comme Lara, tant des rivières de larmes noircies par la mascara

Tu me rends folle. (Hysteric love)

Je ne veux plus, je ne veux plus
J'ai beau pleurer je fini dans tes bras
Je ne veux plus de cet hysteric love

Tu vois t'es pas la seul
Un vide ressort
Bien sur qu'on mérite le mec quand le cur pris et puis, même ça
Tu sais j'suis possessive mais ne m'en veux pas
Mais t'imaginais, dans les bras d'une autre, c'est plus fort que moi

On fraude le train de vie, comme le météore au RER
Vu du ciel, Paris une fourmilière
Terre promise des proxos, Cité Carter des toxos
Virée nocturne en vaisseau sur ce morceau de vagesau (Sauvage)
La gay pride aux aguet, les microbes piétinne les Skins et les gays
Ont supportera le P.S.G même relégué
Prend la fuite en Vélib; c'est moi rodav
Paris plage, nos seine rempli de calibre et de cadavre
Le mal être en dévellopement, la gamberge sorti d'un pot d'echappement
On pisse sur les monuments, y a plus d'histoire en bas de nos batiments

Virée nocturne sur du Rohff, on monte sur Paris

Bienvenue en vacances, sur l'Ile de France
Le Dollar se fait baisé au change, Time Square c'est la Defense
Le Bresil à pris 3 bastos au Stade de France
Les Kainry range leurs chaines dés l'atterissage, vols avec violence
Entre l'office du tourisme et nous, v'la le décallage
En cas de recalage, Paris sort la Kalash (ouais ouais ouais)
Pour t'arrosé Paris a le bon tuyau, 
Paris roule en FéFé le week end, et la semaine en Clio
La région compte 8 departements, en fusion 8 prisons
Vingtaine d'arrondissement, c'est truffé de shmit
A l'horizon, le syndicat du crime en collabo avec le syndicat du string
Ils se mouillent les michtos bien organisé des Fouquet au Pink
Tous en mode, capitale de la mode, les mannequins
Un monde parallèle, les Saoudiens kiffe ce monde pas Halal
Se termine en after dans un Loft, accent de Vikings
Sort chez toi, t'es dans le ring, t'es une victime ou mène une vie de king

Tu sors avec le corps et le cerveau musclé, moral en barbelé..
Dis au Hassasse de parler moins fort,
C'est rien que des portes clefs, Nique les !
La rue n'entend qu'une seule voix, la vrai, ne s'écoute qu'entre vrais
On les saigne, ils nous craignent, il nous aiment mort ou au frais
Les ennemis pissent le sang, je suis tellement haut
Qu'il rêve de me descendre
Au lieu de me baiser la main, afin de tout baiser ensemble
Tu peux tous faire à Judas, il est jamais reconnaissant
Je préfère un frère qui a le sida, qu'une balance du même sang !
C'est la hass, trop mito, que de la lèche, plus de classe,
Ca sort les liasses, se met en hass pour des crasseuses dégueulasses !
Soit près pour le gang bang, à moi tout seul je suis un gang
Ma carrière c'est le big bang, je suis plus vrai que les billets de banque.

Que Dieu m'préserve de gaspiller mes bons et mes projets
Pas de protection rapprochée, j'balance la tête et les crochets

Vi vive la génération rapline qui écrit bourrée et ne kick que des punchlines
Ils veulent un feat je pousse la chaise roulante de leur buzz
Mais les oreilles ne se partagent pas quand il s'agit de hous
Ne mélangeons pas les odeurs, c'est l'interprète et auteur
Du génocide, on enregistre au bord de l'homicide
Trop de rumeurs et de commentaires, peu d'action

Le rap game veut sa part du ghetto
Ses stratégies marketing, la taule, les braquos, bitchs en casting
Des armes en photos, il revendique la 0.9, que du bluff
Avant son succès il gérait 0 meuf
Il perd son sang froid, exprime sa jalousie

Virée nocturne au snack sur Pigale, avec mes Noirs, mes Arabes
Toujours un rass que ta croisé au Habs, mais lui il fait shab
Parloir deuxième tour, l'amour est venue en mini jupe

ROH2F à fond dans la caisse, garé
Ca se remet de sa soirée
Il y avait grave de la shnek, il parait
Ca redoute une descente de Stup, ça va séparé
Ca remonte à la baraque et d'autres remonte sur Paris
Ca déboule de Rivoli et rentre par la grande armée
Dans la plupart des Smart des michtos, strip teaseuse, cramé
4 sorties de pots, jantes noirs, contoure Chromé
Tu pleures dessus au feu, derrière mes vitres teintées j'tai cramé
Quand j'arrive les gens s'arrête toujours de parlé
Tout pourri la soirée, bah ouais, s'marré, bourré
C'est pas bien c'est baré, j'avoue j'suis chaud
Cherche un pretexte pour me bagarré
Nos caractères nous porte préjudice
Le temps de bordé mon fils, et de faire un tour 
Qui m'emmenera devant la Justice
Dangeureux pour nous même, Paix à ceux qui nous aime
Et plaire à tout le monde, c'est plaire à n'importe qui
""Je vous emmerde""
J'passe du ghetto au 5 étoiles Genève en 1h
D'une Garde av, aux arrivants en l'espace de 72H

Spécial pour les adultes qui ont grandit sans calins,
Que rien a donné, n'ayant rien reçu étant gamin,
Le texte est sombre mais sincère comme un larbin,
Qui ouvre son cœur et son ? à une catin,
A la vitesse d'un lapin, les sentiments s'expriment,
Sans amour comme un tapin on joue a sex-crime ou basic instinct,
Menotté au pic a glace on se termine tout est permis sauf s'embrasser tellement on s'estime,
Croyant s'aimer dans une histoire de cupidon, 
On ne fait que se vider sur la tombe de cupidon a 8 clos,
Peau contre peau, 
Belle contre beau,
Chaude contre chaud,
Bête contre dos,
Amatrice contre pro,
Capte les réseaux du sexe sadomasochiste,
Vienne au contact en ? dans les boîtes échangistes,
Ce vice ne vise que la performance,
Et le X a drogué le verre de la romance

On se donne, on se perd, on s'oublie,
À faire l'amour sans amour, 
L'argent et le sexe dans le corps et les esprits,je les vois vivre sans amour
Tout semble faux autour de ma vie, la terre tourne sans amour,
Le monde est froid et le cœur s'endurcit à trop airé sans amour

Y a pas de sentiments, que des centimètres 
De nos jours les cœurs sont vides sans émois,
Protèges ton cœur, on va le brisé,
On se voue au sexe et au excès, 
Mais pourquoi? pourquoi? Pourquoi?
On a plus foie? que dieu nous guide
En l'amour, à ces appelles au secours,
Tout le monde reste sourd,Tout le monde reste sourd,
On se perds, on s'oublie

On se donne, on se perd, on s'oublie,
À faire l'amour sans amour, 
L'argent et le sexe dans le corps et les esprits,je les vois vivre sans amour
Tout semble faux autour de ma vie, la terre tourne sans amour,
Le monde est froid et le coeur s'endurcit à trop airé sans amour

Pour les gens qui vivent des choses durs,
Qui ont le cœur en mauvaise posture,
Pour ceux qui soutiennent, qui nous aide,
Qui nous souhaitent que du bien dans ce monde d'ordures,

Les gens ne respirent que par l'oseille,
C'est qu' il en faut toujours plus que la veille,
La guerre de l'amour est vraiment évité,
La rage de la solitude qui te réveille,
Sans amour comme on chasse un gun,
Entre les traîtres et les gros hagun,
Prete tout et ne pense qu'a leur gueule,
Divisé par l'égoïsme et l'orgueil,
Pour sortir de la hass certains sont pret a te zigouillé poto,
Blessé a terre au lieu de t'aider, ils vont te dépouiller poto,
L'homme est le pire des gros rapaces, mon cœur saigne dans ma carapace, 
J'ai du apprendre a me respecter mais, mais j'suis pas de la chair a tass, 
Toujours un plus accroché que l'autre qu'en n'a rien a foutre,
Le corps passe pour une buffet sous lequel on se foutre,
C'est cruel, le côté bestial l'emporte sur le sensuel,
Le physique est primordiale, 
L’âme sœur est un partenaire sexuel,
Le manque d'amour te donne froid, 
T'es comme un fétus sous les draps,
Rare son les gens sur qui tu peux compter, la bonté te perdra 

On se donne, on se perd, on s'oublie,
À faire l'amour sans amour, 
L'argent et le sexe dans le corps et les esprits,je les vois vivre sans amour
Tout semble faux autour de ma vie, la terre tourne sans amour,
Le monde est froid et le cœur s'endurcit à trop airé sans amour

Y a pas de sentiments, que des centimètres,
Oh non, la terre tourne sans amour,
Protège ton cœur on va le brisé

Rohff,"J'viole le feu vert, derrière pas loin les petits frères
Les youvoi les plus sévères, que faire ? A part t'y faire
Négro, je n'ai que faire de tes ragots, j'ai séquestré ton égo
T'es si seul dans la rue quand tu parles y a de l'écho
Qui va, qui va bouger, se faire coucher, à t'arracher
À te doucher, cartoucher, pour m'avoir touché

Rdv broliké ok on arrive 
Tu te chies dessus comme un mouton à la veille de l'aïd
T'es plus aimé, donc t'es plus haï, aie 
T'es plus blindé, donc tu seras le plus trahi, aie 
Popopopo aïe, il y a du sang dans mon hip hop, qui veut me stop try
Ils ne sont grands qu'en taille, dans la place les meufs restent et les hatay
Aïe je rappe en français et je t'éclate en thaï
Je mets un hi-kick à cro cop, casse le bras de steven seagle
Si sa tourne mal, je te ferai une clef de desert eagle
Ferme ta geule ou bien sort ton gun et assume
Moi c'est minimum double disque d'orgueil
Je suis en beef avec moi-même dans le rap game
Ils sont plein de comédie musicale comme dans fame
Moi je frappe et je dégaine

Tchek le code de l'horreur violent et vulgaire 
Nique ta mère fils de pute ou c'est nous qui allons le faire
Les ragots, les remix, c'est tous ce qu'il peuvent faire
Après le mal qu'on leur fait, on va dire que c'est de bonne guerre
Tchek le code de l'horreur, pas de paroles en l'air
On compte plus les gorilles qu'on a monté en l'air

Ouaouaoua vitry oh vitry yeah
Les mcs sont en mother fucking hass
Ouaouaoua vitry oh vitry yeah
Enfouraillé dans une mother fucking caisse

Dès que j'ai le mic en main je deviens le serial money maker
Si je dois te découper, je le ferai même si ça m'écoeure
D'essouffler ton étoile, engraisse tous les bookmaker
Je fais de n'importe quel beat maker un joyeux hit maker
Beaucoup de rigueur quand je taffe et quand je tire
Je mise mes couilles, prends les tiennent pour les réinvestir
Notre avenir est cagoulé, je veux pas finir comme shine
Jusqu'au bout j'espère que tu me feras pas perdre mon time
Je suis en concert à saint anne
Un stylo et c'est le drame
Comme un malade mental qui s'acharne à coup de schlass dans ton crâne
Mets toi à 4 pattes que je te la mette en lucarne
Bonne raison de tout gâcher, j'te le jure sur le coup de tête de zidane
Presse la détente pour le respect vital comme respirer les amoureux de la vie peuvent soupirer
Les petite putes de la nuit peuvent espérer me serrer
Je te passerai dessus que si je te ligote sur la voie ferrée

Rohff,"Je te présente la solitude
Celui-là il t'emmènera sillonner la Banlieue-Sud
Elle snobe mes habitudes
Tu ne vois que sa caisse quand elle repart
Que ses jantes quand elle se gare
Tu te jettes dans le vide quand t'es au-bord de son regard
Toute les langues du monde ne pourraient combler son silence
Faudra meubler le néant jusqu'à la clé de sa conscience
Et j'en perdrais le sens de ma définition
C'est comme séparer les problèmes de leurs solutions
Je l'ai vu tenir la chandelle, lors d'une friction
Le sourire de mes fistons
Lui donne toujours des frissons
J'en ai la chaire de poule quand elle caresse ma douleur
Son amour me fait mal à m'en mordre le cœur
Malgré nous le temps nous attache aux séquelles
Renvoi des flashs
Comme un ex-pilote de chasse, traumatisé par un crash
De la foule, elle me déshabille du regard, elle se lâche
Comme les junky, mon stylo la shoot et la soulage

Le chemin que j'ai pris dans ma vie 
Et mon métier m'oblige a te dire ce que j'ai sur le cœur
Je me sens si seul 
Je sais qu'on ma trahi, mais je sais que j'ai déçue aussi
Quand la peine se mélange au regret
On se sent si seul 

Ma solitude ne sort pas de l'imagination
?
Tu peux fouiller dans ma voix
Tu ne trouveras que des vérités
Car le jumeau de la fiction n'est autre que la réalité
J'ai l'impression qu'elle est venue au monde avec moi
Qu'elle a grandi avec moi
Qu'elle voyage avec moi
Qu'elle prend de l'âge avec moi
Qu'elle s'engage au mariage avec moi
Qu'elle rit et pleure avec moi
Qu'elle vit et meurt avec moi
Plus t'es riche, plus elle te michetonne 
Tu l'affectionnes
À trop vouloir la maquiller son charme te mitonne
T'as beau la tromper elle reste fidèle
Tu vis d'elle
Te vide sur elle en cellule comme dans une chambre d'hôtel
Elle console, recolle les morceaux des cœurs brisés
Son fantôme resurgit pour fait payer les pots cassé
Maniaque active, jour et nuit insomniaque
Manipulatrice, elle rend aigri, paranoïaque

Le chemin que j'ai pris dans ma vie 
Et mon métier m'oblige a te dire ce que j'ai sur le cœur
Je me sens si seul 
Je sais qu'on ma trahi, mais je sais que j'ai déçue aussi
Quand la peine se mélange au regret
On se sent si seul 

J'honore la solitude des mitards des GAV
Des paraplégiques des écartés atteints du HIV
Des veuves aux sourires aussi forcés
Que les mariages des mères que les pères ont dû divorcer
Une pensée pour la solitude des orphelins
Des sans-abris ni soutiens
Des oubliés qui tournent en cash comme des félins
La solitude t'observe du fond d'un wagon ou sur un banc
Elle adopte pour seul ami une bouteille ?
Ces compagnons se comptent que sur la moitié d'une main
Leur entente ne tient que sur ce triste point en commun
Je cherche réponses aux questions
Dans une glace du balcon
Des nuages à l'horizon
Du carrelage au plafond
La main dans le caleçon, la tête ailleurs quand on me parle
Traîne tard dans le brouillard
À Broyer du noir pour aller nulle part
Je suis le fruit que le temps a fait mûrir
Que personne n'a cueilli à défaut de pourrir
Comme un millionnaire entouré de timpes
Sous une tente un futur mort séquestré
Calibrer à la tempe pour se détendre
La solitude fume boit jusqu'à t'oublier
Et à l'usure elle s'enlise avec toi dans le sablier 

Le chemin que j'ai pris dans ma vie 
Et mon métier m'oblige a te dire ce que j'ai sur le cœur
Je me sens si seul 
Je sais qu'on ma trahi, mais je sais que j'ai déçue aussi
Quand la peine se mélange au regret
On se sent si seul 

Les chemins que j'ai pris dans ma vie
Et mon métier m'oblige à te dire ce que j'ai sur le cœur
Je me sens si seul, si seul
? mais je sais que j'ai déçu aussi
Quand la peine se mélange aux regrets
Je me sens si seul, si seul",Si Seul
Rohff,"Je pense à la mort constamment, c'est le dernier testament 
Rédigé consciemment, fais comme si j'étais mort récemment. 
Je rappe pas hardcore pour fasciner les bourgeois, comme les autres rabat-joie,
Évite de me faire remarquer devant les gens, calme ta joie
Trop sincère pour la jouer star pourtant le plus brillant de la constellation
Vous le savez tous gardez vos prix, vos révélations
Pas besoin de vos fellations pour maintenir l'érection
Je me sens toujours seul dans ma direction
Ma voix te surine, mon son dévalorise leur frime
Exprime crime, trime, centime, je porte mes couilles en guise de bling bling
C'est la fin du monde, prend mon style comme un signe
Plus tu me détestes, plus je progresse et ce jusqu'à ce qu'on m'assassine
Bouge la tête comme un co-co-co-co-coq picore mes rimes
Tu peux me chanter la main sur le coeur comme un hymne
Ma parole est plus fiable que l'amitié, plus claire qu'une vérité
Mes regrets sont biens dans leur peau irritée, 
Rescapé de l'immaturité, richesse de la précarité 
En toute humilité, j'ai plus de quatre vérités, 
Je suis bon qu'à militer contre le système
Faire outrage aux autorités me faire embarquer menotté sous les sirènes
Je suis ce microbe excédé de problèmes
Qui casse sa dernière bouteille d'Heineken
Pour tagger sur son bras toute sa haine
Étalé au milieu de l'avenue avant que les ""Pin-pon"" n'interviennent
J'ai marché aussi loin que j'ai pu, je suis devenu ce que j'ai pu
On est maître de son corps comme on est maître de son véhicule
On n'est pas maître de sa mort mais on est maître de son vécu
Je suis né sans garanties, et quand on souffre au ralenti
Vient l'idée de violer ses envies 
Qui te conditionnent à dégainer face à toi-même, insulter la juge
Et ta daronne n'est pas au bout de ces peines que tu purges
Le meilleur des refuges, et dans le din , ça te donne une bonne mine
Les ablutions te purifient les mains tachées d'hémoglobine
Fier d'être Muslim, que Dieu me guide si j'en suis pas digne
Avec ou sans la tâche au fond on est des gens bien, au fond on est hnine
Même la sagesse ne rend pas parfait, ressens la bonne intention
Bien que j'avoue être mal placé pour donner des leçons
Étrange paradoxe entre les actes et les mots
Car c'est toujours la guerre entre mes anges, mes démons
Les tentations me tournent autour, m'affaiblissent et me détournent
Trop de boule et de thune dans la nature, t'as la tête qui tourne
Satan ricane quand tu te lèves pas pour faire soubh
T'entends pas l'adhan mais l'appel des sous même quand t'es sourd
Pour ceux qui boient la tasse dans la hrra, blam blam
J'envoie des signaux pour les naufragés dans la haram
Parce que le ghetto veut faire briller la zermi
Visage grillé qu'on essaye de faire passer comme un faux permis
À la prière on s'y est remis, à défaut de tarder de la faire
Harami fier, tape des roues arrières dans les couloirs de l'enfer
V'là l'ardoise de pêchés, on espère être repêchés
On prend notre temps au lieu de se dépêcher
On cherche un plan, thune ou neché
Certains ont l'air de se faire chier quand un frère est en train de prêcher
Rien que ça jure hakdin Islam, bourré ou perché
« Génération sacrifiée » à dévierger ton rap conscient, engagé 
J'en ai perdu mon sang pendant que les autres se cachaient
Métissé par le mal et le bien, je renie pas ma couleur
J'en ai le poil hérissé d'en avoir vu de toutes les douleurs
« Regretté » t'a mis en pleur, donné la force et même poussé
À fouetter tes efforts comme un cheval pour avancer
Ma vie une métaphore, ne mords pas la main qui t'a nourri
Ne me juge pas et prends le bon côté d'un fruit pourri
J'ai misé le peu de bien que j'avais en moi
J'en ai cédé un bout à celles qui ont un gosse de moi
Les épreuves peuvent faire de toi un homme meilleur
Faire de toi le meilleur, pour faire voir en toi un monde meilleur
J'ai flirté avec la peur sous la menace d'une arme
J'ai nargué la mort écartant les bras, perdant mon calme
J'ai fait des fautes que le Sheitan a sifflé
J'ai forniqué, j'ai fumé, j'ai bu, mais jamais sniffé
J'ai braqué, j'ai frappé, j'ai baffé même tirer pour briefer
Mais jamais baisé un pote, pourtant mon dos est bien griffé
Je suis le bonhomme qu'on a jamais vraiment aimé
J'ai présenté l'avenir à mon prochain, en retour il m'a blâmé
Je suis venu en paix, illégalement armé
J'ai appris le maniement sans l'armée, l'instinct de survie le permet
Sois t'agis sois tu crèves, que Dieu me préserve
La morgue te conserve et au chtar, faudra faire évader tes rêves 
Mon rythme de vie, pimenté de jalousie, d'hypocrisie
M'ont entraîné dans le courant de la frénésie
Et diminué par conséquence ma clairvoyance
Car on tire profit de ton talent et ta vaillance
Il a fallu que la lumière s'éteigne pour que je prenne conscience
Et apprenne à reconnaître les amis de circonstance
Angoissant, stressant, de se réveiller la bouche en sang
Vu qu'on s'endort dans les bras de la fureur en se mordant les dents
L'estomac noué, on pète dans les draps, rêvant d'être libérable
Bercé par les cris des rats à qui je dédie ce rap
Car ils n'ont pas craché sur le reste de la gamelle
Que j'empoisonnais à l'eau de javel
Je les voyais crever dans ce monde cruel
C'est la vision qu'on a de l'intérieur d'un trou de balle
40 degrés à l'ombre, j'ai pas rasé les murs des promenades
Check, check, le code de l'horreur, jugé par le code pénal
Pour moi c'est banal, je veux dire c'est pas l'affaire Bonnal
Passage à tabac médiatique, rien de dramatique
La solitude c'est ma pote, ma pute, elle me charme en public
Une petite larme émotive pour la daronne appelée à la barre
Comment plaider contre l'un de ses fils quand l'aîné risque le placard
La proc' une arbiya rachetée par l'état
Maître Haïk n'y peut rien et je suis pas le frère de Rachida
Ma vie mise à poil, les journalistes ont la barre
Pinnochio mythonne, il veut ma place et ma part
Prends pas ton grand frère pour rival, mais pour exemple
Sache que si on te regarde un peu, c'est parce que tu me ressembles
Pourquoi tu cours, en criant ""Police, Au secours""
J'allais pas te tirer dessus mais peut-être te crosser par amour
Je rigole, on choisit pas sa famille, 
Je pardonne, parce que notre chère mère est encore en vie
À chaque mal un bien, on en sort grandi, quand on chute on rebondit
On se refait comme des bandits, l'album sort en condi'
Me raconte pas ce qu'ils ont dit, ca change rien à ma destinée
Ma galaxie est trop agitée pour la dessiner
Rien n'est calculé, naturellement on se distingue
J'ai toujours fait la diff', c'est pour ça que je me sappe en Distinct
Je suis pas né dans la soie, Ikbal et moi on n'a pas d'autre choix
Que de banquer et voir nos gosses crier de joie
J'ai le mort, je suis bon qu'à péter le score, remplirai Bercy à ras bord 
Mes sons passent les frontières sans passeport
La plupart reconnaîtront le taulier du hardcore
Te prends pas la tête, même les prophètes n'ont pas mis tout le monde d'accord
J'honore la ""Thug mentale"" à l'échelle mondiale
Ma musique s'épanouit partout où les gens ont la dalle
On est pas des perdants on gagne à coup sûr comme Hollyfield
Tes oreilles garderont mes traces de morsure quoi qu'il arrive
Si je me fais tuer je sais qui ira me venger. Provoqués par le don que j'ai
Les jaloux se réjouissent de me savoir en danger
En isolement dans la pire des maisons d'arrêt
Les menaces de mort font naître une angoisse à te foutre une diarrhée
Le malheur du grand aigle fait le bonheur des pies
Mais leurs chances sont bien maigres en cette période de répit, 
En dépit des évènements je bondis de rêves en cauchemars
Ne fais rager que les crevards, ma réussite un traquenard
Ces rapports conflictuels visent l'auto-destruction
Maîtrise tes pulsions, ne laisse pas l'orgueil prendre les décisions
La roue tourne, c'est chacun son tour
Je suis du bon côté du pompe et t'es parmi ceux qui courent
On peut te libérer de cette vie sous caution à notre stade
On parlera de paix avec mon gloque scotché sous la table
Je baisse pas la garde, même devant un manchot
Ils jouent les caïds au mic, mais devant la rue sont moins chauds
Impulsif de nature à en faire trembler les autres créatures
De ta fenêtre, tu me vois triste, sur le banc comme un monstre abattu
On traîne la nuit entre malheureux, rien de glorieux
Mon coeur est trop cuit, mes acquis ne me rendent pas si heureux
Pro et sérieux, ma renommée je la dois qu'à moi-même
Je vais là où mon rap m'emmène, n'accepte pas tout ce qu'ils me ramènent
Ni cornes ni auréoles sur ma tête qu'on se le dise
Je préfère qu'on me crève qu'on me rackette, mémorise.
Je suis pas maqué, mes couilles sont pas truquées ni imposables
Paré aux croisades les yeux ouverts dans une tempête de sable
ROH2F, comme Nike, mon blase est une marque
Quel plaisir de pouvoir se matter dans la glace du 94",Testament
Rohff,"Le rap Français rap en solo
Trop filou pour ton prof de Philo
La folie du stylo je fais des chiffres avec des lettres au culot
Je pèse 94 kilo 400 grammes avec un M16
Je perds un gramme c'est le drame
La violence est commerciale
Pas son charme j'en témoigne
Je suis le dernier écho d'une symphonie qui s'éloigne
Le rap un billet que j'authentifie comme un filigrane
Les rappeurs zig-zag finissent en ligne droite comme un cardiogramme
Sache qu'un aveugle me voit mieux quand je chante
Et que j'ai la voix du silence donc les sourds m'entendent
Je suis venu du bled, le ventre ballonné par malnutrition
J'ai du apprendre à parler devant la télévision
Je mannie la langue comme un cobra
Mon expression t'étrangle comme un boa
Je me demande a quoi sert le baccalauréat
Destin de cancre je serais resté en sixième
Sans anti sèche les premiers de la classe me craignent

La lumière m’obscurcis c'est la poésie du uzi, du uzi
La vie me tape un striptease et ma plume durcie, ma plume durcie
Sur la feuille je me déverse, prend la forme de mon esprit, de mon esprit
La vie me tape un striptease et ma plume durcie, ma plume durcie

Je traîne la vie comme un boulet
Mon talon d’Achille meurtrit
Je suis la main, le coude, l'épaule, le cou, la forme de l'esprit
Symbole d'une vie céleste qui marque
Un des cycles de la mort comme un trimestre
Le naturel humain fait parler la presse
Je me dresse, point culminant des paysages urbains comme le Mont Everest
J'épate les académiciens, rebelle comme un milicien
Ma crédibilité est envié des politiciens
Je balance des machettes reviens au galop
Brandissant la tête des chevaliers des arts et des lettres
Une rafale ramène le calme d'une bibliothèque
La tolérance une nymphomane faut la butter pour qu'elle arrête
J'conjuge mes raisons, énumérant les contradictions
Qui font de moi cet être que j'cherche encore à connaître
J'suis multiple skyzophrénie étouffé dans l'anatomie
Vétu de tissu a défaut d'être enroulé comme une momie
J'suis fait ni de chair ni de sang mais de lave et de glace
J'écris mon chemin tu peux suivre mes pensées à la trace
J'pisse de l'encre à grosse dose, c'est du hard à l'eau de rose
J'déflore les feuilles vierges elles saignent car ma plume est trop grosse

La lumière m’obscurcis c'est la poésie du uzi, du uzi
La vie me tape un striptease et ma plume durcie, ma plume durcie
Sur la feuille je me déverse, prend la forme de mon esprit, de mon esprit
La vie me tape un striptease et ma plume durcie, ma plume durcie

Ici c'est froid, une vie de Russe
Je fais bugger ton esprit je suis le virus
Tu peux toujours me trouver dans une roulette russe
Je me déverse sur la feuille prends la forme du virus
J’emmène la misère plus loin que l'espoir
J'écris l'histoire en faisant des fautes
Comme mérite d'être sincère en déchargeant mon savoir
Parfois aussi vulguère qu'une branlette espagnole
C'est l'après Guerre, l'epoque de Rohff, pas de Marcel Pagnol
J'suis pas votre douleur banale qui tant vous afflige
Mais le prix à payer pour le mal qu'on nous inflige
La gloire des pauvres, la menace des riches
Le poids des mensonges colorant leurs vies monotones qui vous aguiche
Qui suis-je? Un electron libre, viol de ton égo,
Un grand coup de calibre, artistiquement un fléau négro
J'ai joué le jeu sans avoir les bonnes cartes
Plus studieux qu'un enarque, plus majestueux qu'un monarque
Le 9.4 a ses couilles enregistrées à la préfécture
La marginalité de ma culture
J'suis fais de ratures
Virus de la littérature
Comme en agriculture
J'laboure mon terrain, impose ma température
Y'a de quoi faire, transpirer les gorilles dans la brume
faire crier les loups du haut des colines car mon cd c'est la pleine lune
Mon coeur un cimetière de sentiments d'amertume
Coupe la langue de Molière apres qu'elle m'ait léchée la plume

La lumière m’obscurcis c'est la poésie du uzi, du uzi
La vie me tape un striptease et ma plume durcie, ma plume durcie
Sur la feuille je me déverse, prend la forme de mon esprit, de mon esprit
La vie me tape un striptease et ma plume durcie, ma plume durcie


La lumière m’obscurcis c'est la poésie du uzi, du uzi

Chères demoiselle ou dames 
Garde ? sur les bras 
Voulu ou non voulu de l'acte 
Du contact sous les draps 
5 minutes de plaisirs 
9 mois d'attente 
1 bouche à nourrir 
Toi seule connaît cette souffrance 
Éprouvée d'mettre un enfant au monde 
Même le gyné habitué touché par la scène 
J'suis sur qu' t'aurait du mal 
A trouver les mots pour décrire la scène 
S'enlèverait trop de charmes 
Tellement qu' l'instant est émotif 
Quand t'entends ces cris de pleurs 
Tu le pose sur ton coeur 
Qui bat fort comme jamais 
C'est le soleil qu'illumine 
Ton existence et ton bébé 
Retour à l'enfance quand tu jouais à la poupée 
C'est ta poupée d'chair, c'est ta chair 
C'que t'a de plus cher 
Un prix inestimable au enchère 
Tu passe même devant son père 
Aussi comblé par cette merveilleuse aventure 
Car après tout c'est son sang sa progéniture 

5 minutes d'insouciance 
9 mois pour prendre conscience 
Qu'1 bébé est la et tu pense 
5 minutes d'inconscience 
9 mois teinté d'absence 
1 enfant qui a manqué d'chance 

A tout les pères qui r'connaissent leur mômes 
Qui s'défilent pas 
Assument comme des bonhommes 
Mêmes quand il pleure toute la soirée 
Capable de préparer le biberon 
Changer ses couches, le bercer 
Les femmes trouve ça mignon, ben oui 
Maintenant c'est tout pour lui 
Sans doute ta raison de vivre 
Aujourd'hui ton point de repère 
Tes appuis, t'a le rôle du père 
D'ailleurs tu dois mieux comprendre le tien 
Encore plus celle qui ta mis au monde 
Qui te soutient, c'est la nature 
C'est pas plus mal, ça te rend plus mature 
Quand tu pousse la poussette 
Ou qu't'amène à son siège dans la voiture 
Tout tes potes les plus durs sont attendris à sa vue 
Te félicite, le couvre de bisous ?

Les jours et les années passent, le bébé grandit 
Souvent ça s'passe mal 
Quand le père garde le profil de bandit 
Pour tout les couples de banlieue 
Les papas du ghettos 
Qui pour remédier aux problèmes financiers 
Risquent le pénitencier 
Bien mal acquis ne profite jamais 
Faut faire un choix 
Les visites au parloir en larmes 
C'est pas la joie 
A force de déprimer 
Tu te lasse de ces promesses 
T'a mis de cotés des études 
Sacrifié ta jeunesse 

Ma vie mon bonheur tout est gâché 
Il m'a laissée, moi je l'aimais 
Même ma mère ne veut plus me parler

A travers ma voix, tu marche dans ma rue, 
C'que t'entends c'est c'que tu vois, lyrics tirés du marche crue. 
Ça craint. 
T'aimerais que j'te chante autr'chose, mais c'est toujours l'même refrain. 
Mon frère 400 à l'heure, accroches-toi, y'a plus d'freins. 
On enfreint tous les lois, juges procureurs, même les avocats, 
C'est pas qu'des voyous incarcérés, y'a même des hommes d'état. 
Ils ont niqué mon bled, rien à foutre de leurs règles, 
Tout comme leurs filles qui s'font foutre même en période de règles. 
Après avoir arbitrairement fixé les règles du jeu, 
Comme dit l'poto kery james, soit tu marche ou c'est l'enjeu. 
Ils t'envoient à l'ombre pour réfléchir si tu chies neuf. 
L'état c'est la plus grosse carotte, tu sais c'est tout bénef'. 
Taxe la moitié du salaire misérable de nos parents, 
Pourtant les aloc' ont du mal à prendre congé une fois par an. 
J'viens des blocs là où les darons paient pour où aller. 
Ça c'est le rap des familles nombreuses, des mères au foyer. 
Pourquoi ils peuvent pas comprendre? 
Ils ont la mentalité du bled. 
Leur mode de vie est différent du nôtre, c'est pas d'leur faute. 
Moi j'suis propre, j'ai un minimum d'éducation. 
Mon point d'repère: l'islam, un bon garçon qui a grandit sans son père. 
Mon p'tit frère et moi, on a prit l'avion pour v'nir dans c'pays, 
Pour nos études mais l'système à fait d'nous, des soldats sans treillis. 
Le bonheur à ses étages comme la rime. 
C'est hallucinant.

Comme quand t'attends une réponse d'un boss ou brave alors qu'c'est allô c'est moi. 
Sinon on a les pieds bloqués dans la merde, comme dans du ciment. 
Ceux qui parviennent à s'en sortir passent pour des gens fascinant. 
Comme des dirigeants, avare et riches d'exigences. 
Pour nos familles opprimées et accablées c'est désobligeant. 
Alors ils snobent les familles nobles au rang social élevé, 
Ils causent avec dédain, insultent enfant mal élevé. 
Pendant qu'les riches tuent le temps, le temps tue les pauvres. 
Chez moi on s'contente plus du comptoir,
les p'tits ont l'appétit de rafle et de coffre, on risque. 
Les keufs, déboulent, gyrophares, v n'r,
chez moi on s'branche plus sur Sky, en prévention scanner. 
J'ai des connaissances ils ne savent ni lire, ni écrire, y'a pas pire, 
Mais j'vais t'dire, ils prennent des tunes quand t'es en train d'dormir. 
C'n'est pas pour les vanter, c'qui n'est pas dit n'est pas su. 
Je fais qu'raconter, la réalité, y'a rien d'inventé. 
L'argent aveugle les jeunes, savent plus sur qui ils tirent, 
Savent plus où ils en sont, où ils vont, ne leur parle pas d'avenir. 
Et quand t'as pas mit de côté, juste pour kiffer être coté, 
Les jeunes courent droit vers l'enfer, même avec un point d'coté, 
Rien à faire, à part tomber dans l'vice des substances illicites. 
Une fois les esprits rôdés, les bandes tombent en déficit. 
Ça s'félicite tellement, qu'ça arrive vite aux oreilles d'indics, 
Qui lui ne tard'ra pas à passer un coup d'fil, en informer les flics. 
Des lops sont en poste là où tu réside, pour t'filer, 
Jusqu'à ton prochain braco à la sortie ils te jettent le filet. 
Alors c'est soit tu coopère, ou prend la fuite mais faut défourailler. 
(Avec un putain d'révolver qui risque pas d's'enrailer. 
Ton coeur bat tellement vite) qu'il peut lâcher à tout moment. 
(Et quand, on t'tire dessus gros) t'oublies tout l'monde, et même ta maman. 
Quand tu t'fais épingler, pas d'caresse ou tu t'fais étrangler. 
A la BRP tu t'fait gonfler jusqu'à ronfler.Au poste, j'ai vu des photos prise en hauteur, 
Qui dit qu'ton voisin n'est pas un RG, une famille d'inspecteurs. 
On s'dispute le secteur, entre Rick Hunter,
tout fous les psychopathes, t'a Hannibal lecteur. 
Posé sur l'banc, t'a pas l'air d'un vendeur d'shit ni d'came, 
Suspect d'être passé du vélo volant grosse caisse, bécane. 
Comment s'passer d'se faire plaisir quand t'a du fric. 
Ça attire les michtonneuses, une sorte de bite autant qu'les flics.
 
Yeah! L'oisiveté est mère de tous les vices. 
Le vice t'achète, en t'rendant service, en t'donnant du shit, en te f'sant la bise. 
Ça fait du bien d'flamber, n'importe quand tu peux t'faire plomber. 
C'qui t'fait trembler t'as plein d'embrouilles en cours, en plus t'as pas d'plan B. 
Certains sont discrets, d'autres se font r'marquer, c'la jouent durs. 
Ce sont les même dont vont soumis des drogues dures. Bref, tu m'écoutes? 
Quand t'as les steurs sur tes côtes, qui t'mettent sur écoute, 
Si c'est pas toi dans la cassette ils font en sorte qu'ça coïncide. 
Aux assises, déballent toute ta vie, devant tes potes qui assistent. 
Y'a des durs qui pleurent d'entendre leur vécu, à l'oral c'est triste. 
Ton père dégoûté, ta mère n'en trouve plus l'sommeil la nuit. 
Image à elle et l'fatiha pour l'parleur de nuit. 
Parloirs sauvages, dédicacés à ceux et celles, 
Qui vont casser la voix, comme Patrick Bruel, 
Aux générations confondues des ruelles, 
Bons ou mauvais, crapuleux même cruels. 
Pour tous les Vitriaux, tombé à l'époque du blues, 
Des racailles font les bom-bom, le sound-system foutait la caille. 
Les jeunes s'forment du ghetto aux schtars, 
Normal qu'ils pètent un câble, c'est cinq piges de promenade, de mitard. 
Toujours en r'tard, t'as raté l'bippeur, tout l'monde à un portable. 
La prison fait d'certains des cons, d'autres des gens respectables. 
Une fois libérable re belote, dur de s'réinsérer. 
A l'affût d'gros coups un gros somme, prémédité avec le SSEM. 
On est encore à l'age de pierre, on ne peu plus civilisé. 
C'est la guerre du feu version fringues et rasés. 
Trop nerveux, mitho, michto, schizophrène. 
Trop d'potos ont grandit à Fleury, vieillard freine. 
Sous l'oeil de successeurs encore mangeur de gâteau BN. 
T'as, à l'écrit des écoles, leurs prédécesseurs mener leur vie d'bohème. 
Génération d'BM, braqueurs d'BM, t'es adapté aux rythmes de vie, 9.4 400bpm. 
(Vitry) Une banlieue parmi tant d'autres. 
Ici comme chez toi, la paresse gagne du terrain sur l'envie d'changer des nôtres. 
On roule sans permis, nique le RMI, on shoot le coeur,
t'as pas un rayon d'bonheur dans la zer-mi. 
Disparaît, lâche pas l'survet' même quand c'est glacial, 
Fait rien d'spécial, les p'tits s'réchauffent les orteils au centre commercial. 
On fait l'fort pendant l'juste prix. 
En fin d'journée s'remet d'sa soirée. 
H 24 dehors sauf pour cause d'une diarrhée. 
Le plus triste c'est qu'ça t'fait marrer. 
Mais pour nos vieux, on vit comme des princes. 
On rentre pour manger dormir, en gros faut à pinces. 

Les jeunes s'fouttent d'leur santé,
misent tout dans l'apparence chic, souffrent d'une chique. 
Les rages de dent soulagées au sky, shit.
Garé sur l'parking, monte le son dés qu'y'a les flics. 
Ecoute du ragga-roots à l'ancienne, bouge du pranton deranit silk. 
Epais tel un sandwich du dépôt, en manque de calcium, pour s'inscrire au gymnasium. 
M'faire investire dans un Magnum, pour éduquer les mastocs, avec le mach toc. 
Même les mutilés d'guerre nous plaignent et regrettent pas leur époque. 
Constate, après la Gaule, la France, bientôt les states,
j'accuse l'état, d'nous avoir mit dans c't'état.

Six millions d'façon d'mourir, s'pourrir s'nourrir. 
Plaisir empoisonné par l'diable en train d'sourire à notr'malheur. 
L'homme succombe aux tentations, en jouant à la course contre la montre, 
Avec la mort, toujours à l'heure pour nous rattraper. 
C'est comme cet inspecteur qui cherche plus à t'flinguer qu'à t'attraper, 
Ou cet homme, cette femme affranchis, que sans préservatif, le SIDA ils peuvent l'attraper. 
Mais l'désir, la chair l'emporte c'est instinctif, sans capote, 
C'est comme tremper son zgeg dans un plat d'nouilles, 
C'est comme braquer sans cagoule, même les balles ont leurs douilles. 
Eviter les situations, c'est mon seul point d'chute. 
Pourtant j'ai l'amour du risque autant qu'ces hommes qui sautent dans l'vide en parachute. 
Pour l'élastique, c'est croque, c'est fantastique, 
L'inconvénient, ça tient qu'à un fil, ça craque, c'est comme le plastique. 
Le résultat est l'même, pourtant je sens qu'elle m'aime
autant que mon pote à qui ma mère ouvre la porte, 
Qui m'engrène, la mauvaise graine est parmi nous-tous.

C'est plutôt une info qu'une intox, qu'tu sois une nympho ou un tox'.

On est peut-être pas fait pour tous s'entendre comme au téléphone
Mais vive la technologie, j'exporte ma gamberge à travers ce microphone
Posé à polygone, à tête repose, en train de poser la bombe underground
Nucléaire qui f'ra sauter l'hexagone
Comme Hiroshima, par ses secousses fait trembler les fauves dans la brousse
Les accros d'couscous, les zoukeurs d'secouss
Je vous représente tous depuis l'époque de la MJC au microphile
Projète en relief le portrait du monde aussi crapuleux qu'un nécrophile
J'te parle même pas des zoophiles, ce monde c'est pas du gâteau man
Rien qu'on s'emmerde jusqu'à ce qu'on s'nique comme les scatomanes
Heureusement qu'il reste des gens bien, qui se lèvent tôt man
Nique les mythomanes, j'ai des potes c'est des cleptomanes
On a tous bu la tasse dans la merde
Tous ceux qui battent des nageoires sans cesse pour pas s'noyer dans un tas de merde
On a pris goût à souffrir, mais faut s'ouvrir pour s'étendre, pour s'entendre
Faut dialoguer avec respect sans s'gonfler ni prétendre
Savoir attendre son tour, que tu sais un dur ou un tendre
Faut pas se leurre, on part tour à tour
Que ça soit violemment, naturellement
Pour ceux qui menacent de mort s'mythone en tête que eux ils vivront éternellement
J'aime bien les gens simples et humbles, qui savent communiquer sympathiquement
Comment parler de paix alors que certaines se réalisent pathétiquement
C'est pratiquement impossible donc encore rester impassible
Tout le monde est passible d'une sentence
Je viens de là où les jours de mort des habgad sont aussi attendus que le jour de leur accouchement
Pour leurs mères c'est tendu
Là où les nuits sont noircis par les caractères paros qu'on blesse ton ego
Au regard des gens tu fais payer le tarot
D'un moment à l'autre çà peut virer à l'honneur, on préjuge mort
Dans la rue tout l'monde peut se faire juge procureur
On a le coup de foudre pour l'acier, la parole devient brute
Même quand t'as un môme t'es pas gracié
Après les jours d'deuil, on prend les mêmes, on recommence
C'est con c'est toujours la même chanson donc, c'est toujours la même danse
On est peut-être pas issu des mêmes couilles, on a peut-être pas têté le même sein
On peut-être pas le même sang mais on aime le même son
On a les mêmes gueules, les mêmes dégaines
Avec les mêmes guns on dégaine
On aime les mêmes biz, les mêmes voitures qui roulent la nuit
Avec les mêmes meufs dans les mêmes boîtes de nuit
Gros, en gros on a le même quartier
J'ai fait le tri d'mes fréquentations, suivant la façon dont on se comporte
Connaissant la nature de l'homme, moins j'ai d'potes mieux j'me porte
Je me suis rendu compte à quel point le rap avait bousé les gens
Jusqu'à les rendre méchants, même chiant
Ça devient chaud d'faire de l'argent
J'ai rapé comme personne, comme t'aurais fait, je profite de c'don
L'inconvénient avec mon miel, attire autant d'abeilles que de bourdons
Et pourtant, combien de fois j'ai dû gratter le croûton de la marmite
Est-ce toi qui me fais les courses quand mon frigidaire est vide ?
Je connais la faim autant que la Fatiha
Issu des bidonvilles, du bled
Je suis en France tout sec avec un gros bide plein de vers solitaires, mec
Inchallah que le rap me soit bénéfique
Je suis sur une mission, débordant de projets, d'astuces, d'ambitions
Que ça soit prolifique, j'envoie la mama faire ses beaux jours
Et que le mariage de ma sista lui soit magnifique
Y en a qui ont choisi de raper ""ces soirées là"", moi j'ai choisi de raper cette vie là
Donc c'est pas de la bite mais du bitume jusqu'à ma villa
Sans calculer les rumeurs mythos les a ce qui paraît
Fait comme je fais reste le même, change pas quand j'apparais
Je râle plus que toi si ce n'est ce flow cette voix, qui fait que Rohff c'est moi
Je rape rafale comme un scorpio
Pas besoin d'grimacer dans les photos, de menacer dans les interviews
On sait comment se finit une carrière au top 50 des voyous
Casque intégral bécane oscar en trois fuck you
Moi je suis pas là pour faire le zoulou comme des yoyos
Mon album Strohff contre du shit au chtar par les yoyos
Les fous en sont dingues, les folles en raffolent, les marmots nous kiffent

15/12/77, ma date de naissance, venu au monde en silence
Avec des grosses baffes pour me faire chialer, d'entré la violence
C'est du ventre de ma mère que je m'élance, rien ne m'étonne
Le c?ur anesthésié mes larmes se retiennent
Sauf sur les vannes de crapules 10 fois plus drôle que Djamel en scène
Oh no, j'suis pas surhumain, comme toi je saigne, j'ai pris goût à la douleur
J'aimais bien les tibias contre tibias,
Les coups de plafond dans le mur pendant les périodes nerveuses
Sur les bâtards j'aimais bien me défouler,
Phalanges gonflées traces de chicots les poignés foulés
A toutes peaux recousues, poumons perforés, arcades pétées, césariennes, crânes balafrés
Ceux qui ont déjà voyagé dans le coma l'ont échappé belle de justesse
Qui portent pas plainte, balancent pas, appliquent leur propre justice
En 86 y a eu cet accident d'voiture, j'ai mordu ma langue découpée en 2
J'étais à 8 points de sutures de ne pas raper
T'écouterais qui en ce moment tu kiffes
Moi j'ai gueulé ma race, attaché pour pas que la bouche se ferme, recousu à vif
99 j'ai perdu 7 potes, j'ai jamais eu aussi mal au ventre,
À n'en pas fermer l'?il, souvent le onze contre ventre
Souvent les plus grandes douleurs sont muettes
Je trace ma route le temps que personne ne me pousse à le buter ou à me faire uet
Trop consciencieux pour tomber naïvement amoureux, contrairement aux insoucieux
Naturellement rigoureux, parfois anxieux voir douteux ce qui me rend plus vigoureux
S'accoutumant à surmonter les moments douloureux
Pour t'nir la route dans ce monde tu sais combien il faut être futé
Tous créatures de Dieu, on a le même quartier",Le  Méme Quartier
Rohff,"Hé miroir, dans le rap, c'est qui qui déchire ça.
Des fois je me pose des questions.
Miroir, miroir ne me cache rien dis moi tout.
Moi je m'attends à tout, montre-moi tout.
Mes défauts mes atouts, ici comme partout.
Moi je sais peut être pas tout mais je crois en Dieu avant tout.

Je sais que la curiosité est un vilain défaut,
J'aimerai entrer dans ta peau.
Emprunter tes yeux, m'observer un peu.
Pour voir ce que tu vois quand tu me croises.
Toi qui me côtoies ou qui me toises.
Toi qui est au même titre que moi sur cette terre.
Une force d'attraction aussi puissante que l'argent.
L'envie d'élucider le mystère, déshabiller le regard des gens.
Qui de nos jours insignifiants,
Ce masque de larmes, de joie théâtrales.
Pour ça on libère notre amour que dans le cercle familial.
En France comme partout dans le monde.
L'homme est ainsi fait et on si fait à la longue
Je capte les ondes bonnes ou mauvaises au coup d’œil.
Si tu la joue froid, couvre-toi, il fait moins cinq à l’accueil.
Je m'adapte même si des fois ça m’écœure.
Pour ceux qui prennent un malin plaisir, à mettre leur défauts en valeurs.
J'aimerai visiter ton subconscient, m'entendre dans tes oreilles.
M’imprégniez de ta conscience juste pour voir si ça sonne pareil.

Miroir, miroir, ne me cache rien dis moi tout.
Moi je m'attends à tout, montre-moi tout.
Nos défauts, nos atouts, ici comme partout.
Moi je sais peut-être pas tout,
Mais je crois en Dieu avant tout.

Miroir, miroir, ne me cache rien dis moi tout.
Moi je m'attends à tout, montre-moi tout.
Nos défauts, nos atouts, ici comme partout.
Moi je sais peut-être pas tout,
Mais je crois en Dieu avant tout

J'aimerai comprendre la jalousie puisque chaque chose à une raison.
Je me pose des questions qui n'aboutissent qu'à des suppositions.
Est ce les faibles d'esprits qui se abrutissent de fausses opinions.
Par manque de personnalité, un jaloux est touché par ma vie, Oh! puis non,
C'est comme pour le SIDA, pour ça y a pas d'antidote.
On se contente dont ce que la nature nous dote.
Miroir montre moi ces gens qui cassent du sucre sur notre dos.
J'aimerai les surprendre en live pour qu'ils ressentent en eux ces défauts.
On leur doit pas de compte, ils se rendent pas compte, c'est des fous.
Fais moi apparaître ces gens qui se disent vrai alors que c'est des faux.
Je me méfie des gens, ne négligeant rien, intransigeant. 
C'est comme la Hagra, ça paie mal d'être tigent 
C'est bien d'être sympa, 
Mais ça profite aux gens qui le sont pas. 
Les races maudites d'hypocrites, aux sourires que je ne sens pas, 
Commentent des lapsus révélateurs. 
Je suis un peu parano, paro face aux compliments flatteurs. 
Hé miroir, miroir mais qui dois-je éviter, 
Hein miroir, mais qui dois-je inviter.
Et quand ils nous arrivent un truc bien, est ce qu'on ne l'a pas mérité. 
Donne-moi la clé du tiroir de la vérité. 
Éclaire moi les fonctions de ces facteurs, pulsions, rires, pleurs. 
Le cœur qu'abrite l'amour, la haine, la rancœur. 
Les sentiments autant sur le plan relationnel qu'intimement. 
Si on pouvait les contrôler, on aimerait qui on veut, ça serait de la bombe, non. 
On anticiperait sur la douleur en étant précurseur. 
Miroir montre-moi le lieu où se trouve mon âme sœur. 
Ca peut paraître fou, j'aimerai saisir les sens du désir. 
Du regard au toucher qui t'amène au plaisir. 
Je trouve ça intransigeant le fait de convoiter. 
Miroir dis-moi la vérité, ne me fais pas miroiter
J'aimerai faire disparaître la pauvreté, la supériorité
Tous au juste milieu, on aurait plus à s'affronter. 
Miroir, miroir, au risque que tu te brises. 
J'aimerai anéantir le pouvoir et la méprise
En reflet incarne le visage du vice, 
Image. Le précieux regard qu'une mère porte à son fils. 

Miroir, miroir, ne me cache rien dis moi tout. 
Moi je m'attends à tout, montre-moi tout. 
Nos défauts, nos atouts, ici comme partout.
Moi je sais peut-être pas tout,
Mais je crois en Dieu avant tout.

Rohff,"Parfois, j'arrive plus à écrire, y a rien qui m'inspire, 
Pourtant dans cette vie de dingue, j'ai tellement de choses à dire. 
J'ai du mal, à exprimer, tout ce temps passé à trimer,
Fils d'immigrés ouvriers, familles modestes opprimées. 
(Parfois) je glande avec les jeunes de ma bande,
Y a rien à gratter, à part tes couilles quand le matin tu bande. 
Des fois, je vais au billard, avec une bombe au cinéma,
Je vais tirer au stand, avec Nardo et Tima. 
Quand je me sens bien impossible de faire du sur-place,
Pas de drogue, ni d'alcool, tu ressens les minutes qui passent. 
Parfois, j'ai plus de sous, rien que je gamberge,
J'ai des problèmes, tout le long de ma poche, c'est l'hôtel qui m'héberge. 
Des fois ça va mal je maigris, y a de quoi devenir barge.
Parfois même je me perds les plombs, je prend le large. 
Je vais au sport, je me vide.
Des fois, je suis tout froid, timide, parfois, je suis chaud bouillant, tout speed. 

Parfois, des fois, selon l'humeur du jour l'état du moral, 
Qu'arrive le bien ou le mal, j'essaye souvent de m'évader. 
(Mais je perds le contrôle de mon cœur) 
Parfois, des fois, selon l'humeur du jour l'état du moral, 
Qu'arrive le bien ou le mal, j'essaye souvent de m'évader. 
(Mais je perds le contrôle de mon cœur) 
 
Parfois, j'ai envie de rester seul, mon meilleur ami, c'est la solitude. 
Souvent je rêve de fortune. Des fois je regrette les études. 
Souvent je démarre au quart de tour, et aucun recours,
Je suis comme un fou, mais j'avoue parfois je me goure. 
Je fais des virées nocturnes, violant le code de la route,
Le son à cure, je vais à crêpe avant de me vider les burnes. 
Parfois, j'ai besoin d'une lope en express, une ouverture à chaque,
Comme dit Alix ""ça pète!"" 
Puis je décompresse, avec l'humour qui nous reste,
Pour ne serais-ce qu'un instant, évacuer le stress. 
(Des fois) j'ai le blues, je suis blasé,
Je met mon portable sur messagerie, j'ai plus envie de me raser. 
(Parfois) j'ai envie de me caser, de me casser,
Retourner dans mon pays, pour me décrasser, me purifier l'esprit.
Des fois je songe à arrêter le rap, d'éloigner tous ses mensonges, me mettre dans le deal. 
Une bonne fois pour toutes, j'y pense même quand je dîne. 

Parfois, des fois, selon l'humeur du jour l'état du moral, 
Qu'arrive le bien ou le mal, j'essaye souvent d'm'évader. 
(Mais je perds le contrôle de mon coeur) 
Parfois, des fois, selon l'humeur du jour l'état du moral, 
Qu'arrive le bien ou le mal, j'essaye souvent d'm'évader. 
(Mais je perds le contrôle de mon coeur)
 
Parfois, j'pense à mon père, je l'ai pas vu d'puis 83,
J'avais 6 piges, aujourd'hui, j'en ai 23. 
Des fois, y'a des embrouilles qui te tombe dessus, sois prêt à me jeter dedans, 
Quitte à laisser ta peau, une jambe un bras ou tes dents. 
Parfois, j'suis à pince et j'prend l'taxi. 
Des fois j'triche, j'récupère c'que l'état m'a taxé. 
Parfois, j'sort en boite, évite les sons à répète qu'on s'débecte, 
Les histoires à s'mettre en cavale, ou prendre la perpet'. 
J'aime bien danser, mais jamais dans l'excès. 
C'est pas pour t'vexer, j'rentre en basket là où t'as pas accès. 
Oton ouais, K'1 Fry Mafia, ouh wa. 
Des fois j'ai envie de foutre le darwah, bah ouais. 
Des fois j'vais faire vibrer l'studio, traumatise l'ingénieur. 
Des fois j'rêve d'avoir un fils d'l'appeler Housni junior, 
Avec une charmante demoiselle, tellement mignonne, bonne, 
Qu'un homosexuel craquerais sur elle, kifferait plus les bonhommes. 

Parfois, des fois, selon l'humeur du jour l'état du moral, 
Qu'arrive le bien ou le mal, j'essaye souvent de m'évader.

J'ai grandi en banlieue 
Tu peux lire la routine l'amertume à travers la rétine de mes yeux 
Parmi les victimes du système 
Je suis le narrateur du pourquoi 
Ces modes de vie on en connais tous le cause mais bon voilà quoi!
Faut faire quelque chose pour nos rejetons 
Et si je t'en parle c'est parce que nos mères ont les jetons 
Avis a la génération de moutons dix à la vingtaine 
Tourne le bouton faites attention message très important 
Considère ces informations comme une alerte 
Toi t'es en pleine formation avant que mon pouls soit déclaré inerte 
Et m'incombe de t'éviter de courir droit à ta perte 
Dans ce monde blessé d'illusions la plaie bien ouverte 
En plus de la télévision et l'influence que porte le mauvais exemple 
Sur le bitume, l'engrenage est de plus en plus ample 
Mais qui est l'exemple?
Est-ce celui qui s'instruit se détruit en séjournant en tôle,
En faisant du mal à autrui 
Mais qui est l'exemple?
Celle qui s'instruit se détruit

J'ai fait des conneries de grande envergure 
Mais faut bien qu'on change un jour 
Même si c'est hyper dur 
File dans le droit chemin trace ta route ne te retourne pas 
Chacun sa chance pour certains la roue ne tourne pas 
Ne fume pas, ne te saoule pas 
Pour ta maman et ton avenir va à l'école, ne déconne pas 
Ne traîne pas, rien à gratter à part des problèmes d'argent sale 
Et d'embrouilles qui vient et vite t'as la haine 
La rue n'abrite que des bêtes féroces comme Alien 
Crois-en mon expérience, je suis la philosophie de la haine 
Y a pas de destin en commun fille ou garçon 
Nous sommes les parents de demain (Inchallah attention) 
Du bon exemple faut s'identifier, il faut se méfier du moraliste d'un jour 
Une fois contaminé on devient sourd 
On te fait dealer, troquer c'est pas une couverture 
Combien d'années dure la vie d'un voyou à moins de se faire condamner? 
On donne des bons conseils aux nouvelles générations 
Tandis que les cons essaient de troubler nos opérations 
Chacune de mes phrases coûte cher,

Rohff,"J'ai le stylo à pompe, la rime chevrotine 
Mon son tourne comme une balle à ailette 
Subit comme une tasse qui sous estime 
Y a pas le temps de clash, que des coups de crasses 
J'arrive comme personne s'y attendait, mon style d'un coup trace 
Une big équipe de phrases qui te tombent dessus qui t'écrasent 
Qui provoque ton sourire dès quand la rime passe 
Lyrics aussi lourd que la basse, on te prend en live 
Je met tous le monde alright avec un chant de bonhomme à la Barry White 
Nique sa mère le tact, je me démarque, balle impact 
Image de marque à jamais intact 
Je rap que sur des musiques super fortes 
Dessus j'écris des phrases superbes qui font monter ma super cote 
Fais danser les michtonneuses qui chantent dans les microphones 
Les étudiantes qui se prennent trop sérieuses déhanchent tellement c'est fun 
Ma grande tu veux t'instruire, à moi tous seul je suis une bibliothèque 
Tu veux sortir à moi tous seul je suis une discothèque 
Dès que je pose un couplet en radio,les mecs l'écoutent en boucle 
La rage je viens pointer, les bacs, que les rappeurs se la bouclent 
Je peux te faire chialer une équipe de CRS sur ce violon 
Tellement violant que je donne envie rapper au hardos aux cheveux long 
Je brutalise ton cœur, rap électrochoc 
Je parie que depuis tout à l'heure tu bouges ta tête comme un coq 
Applaudie poto c'est monsieur Rohff qui revient 
Je suis la pierre que choisirait un Palestinien 
Il peut pas t'arriver pire quand je défonce sur ce gros on-s(se) 
Qui te fais balancer tes couilles et tes gros ein-s(se) 
Ne me comparer à personne, laissez moi dans mon délire space 
À la old school j'arrive, bass in your face!

Pour tous les mecs en chien qu'ont les crocs, tient croc ça 

Je sais ce que je dois, adepte du courage 
Ne t'attends jamais à ce que je baisse mon froc fasse des trucs pourris 
Le rap ne peut pas me changer, c'est moi qui le changera 
Tout élaborer, le champ du vice, je vais labourer 
Car on ne fait pas la chanson, c'est le ton qui fait la musique 
Kiffe mon timbre de voix, attouchement psychologique 
Je rap comme je cogne, comme je ken, je rap ma gamberge 
Toute la rage qui m'habite, toute la haine que j'héberge 
Les bonnes choses qui m'habitent, je me dis qu'y a pire mais y'a mieux 
23 piges, au bord de la falaise je saute pas je crois en dieu 
Je rédige le malaise du bitume, prodige, 
Faut que je mette à l'aise ma famille avant le moindre litige 
Avec principe et honneur, sans devoir de compte ni de dette 
Ne dépendant d'aucune drogue, j'ai besoin de toute ma tête 
Je kick en français, un super flow, taille les cainri 
Quand je rap je suis trop 9.4., trop Mafia K1fry 
Mentalité Vitry, c'est l'ABS poto 
Paix à Orly, Choisy, Joinville, toute les villes d'à té-co 
J'm'en bat les couilles de la plaque de ton auto 
Rien à foutre de t'a moto, mec si tu kiffes respect à ton ghetto 
J'suis pas là pour distraire, mais pour te blesser 
Sept bastos qu'on arrive pas à extraire, à prendre ou à laisser 
C'est rien que pour les vrais, 
Mon rap pue les soucis ça m'tuerais de savoir 
Que parmis ceux qui me supportent y'en a qu'on déjà sucé

L'import-export de pute des pays de l'Est,
Bénéfice net pour des proxénètes égoïstes en temps de sieste.
Sachant que depuis Vincennes à porte Clichy,
Ils tapent un black à son mec qui fait clap pour pas être un ien-cli.
Les trav' ont la cote de place Clichy au bois de Boulogne,
Les schlacs ont le bilan trop crade, sous crac à Stalingrad,
S'étant allongé, boulevard Sébastopaul matte-là.
Les SDF allongés, sur le béton leur matelas.
En plein hivers de plus en plus de meurtres de viols dans les pages Faits Divers.
Député maire corrompu relax et bien couvert.
Dans nos rues les jeunes savent plus ce qu'ils font,
Pour 300 sac ça bute sec un convoyeur de fonds.
De grosses organisations, tah! les films d'action sur on fout railler.
De quoi faire un coup d'état, fumer pour railler.
Des fourgons Brinks tapés au lance-roquettes
Des roquettes aux restos sans licence ce qui se finissent en rackette.
Le taux de violence s'accroît sans convalescence,
Les bastos de 9mm, rien que ça sent l'essence c'est paro!
Les parrains qui portent un par un des parents,

L'Haya par la coke, la coke par le héro,
Des feuilles on passe à la paille, ce qui arrange ceux qu'aiment pas le héro.
Ce ça se déroule bien, y auras plus de drogue, des armes,
De trafics, de drames, de meurtres, de perpete, de larmes. 
Même celle qui nous ont mit au monde se dévergondent, à chaque seconde. 
On enregistre autant de pertes que ce perm qui fait condre.

Aucun amour pour vos paysage de champs de blé.

Quand monsieur Rohff s'exprime, c'est pas du rap de fêtards.
Mais de la musique meurtrière, parce qu’il y a eu un meurtre hier, 
La crime tourne dans ma rue, parce que le meurtre y est hier.
Nique ça mère, j'exprime ma rage sur ce son,
Comme de l'amour s'exprime cette garce de Véronique Samson. 
Les jeunes ont besoin de mes chansons,
Parce que mes chants sont assez profond pour soulager la douleur. 
Pas le temps de délirer, l'heure est grave,
Rien à foutre de signer des autographes, je rappe pour les braves. 

C'est de la tristesse que tu peux lire dans mes yeux. 
Comprends pourquoi je fais pas de sentiments. 
C'est de la tristesse que tu peux lire dans mes yeux. 
Désenchanté quand je vois une famille fondre en larmes. 
C'est de la tristesse que tu peux lire dans mes yeux. 
Je serais peut-être jamais friqué, mais bon j'ai pas tout perdu. 
Je veux pas être le favori des dingues, ni celui des baltringues, 
Que dieu m'en soit témoin, je veux être celui des gens biens.

Je rappe dur, le ton froid, involontairement.
A tous les durs qui durent faut se repentir avant l'enterrement.
Même si on est fait à base de problèmes, faut se faire une raison,
Je vais pas me faire baiser par le système, la rue et ses illusions.
Que le chaytane aille se faire mettre, je veux pas être son avocat.
Je rappe honnête. Prends note, mes pensées sont encore nettes.
Je vois plus loin que ce que tu vois à ta fenêtre.
Pourquoi hier la vie t'a fait naître, respect aux frères qui font des rappels, 
Gagnent des hars, c'est net. 
Si t'apprécie c'est le mic. 
Je décris ce que j'éprouve, écris ce que j'approuve, 
Me vide pour mieux remplir ce que je découvre. 
Rien ne va! 
Depuis la nuit des temps, l'orgueil fait monter le ton,
Comment refaire le monde sans la machine à remonter le temps?
Comment la jet-set ce la fombe elle, grave, nous on bave. 
Ignore la jalousie, si tu t'en sort, Bravo mon brave!

C'est de la tristesse que tu peux lire dans mes yeux. 
Comprends pourquoi je fais pas de sentiments.

Je veux pas être le favori des dingues, ni celui des baltringues, 
Que dieu m'en soit témoin, je veux être celui des gens biens. 

Je rap pour les braves, les mecs qui cassent jamais les couilles,
Qui se débrouillent, travaillent honnêtement,
vivent de bracos et de magouilles, respect!
C'est ça, peu importe ton aspect!
Au point où on n'en est, on a la gueule du suspect!
Ramène des larcins, mon style vestimentaire à la démarche.
On se demande pourquoi rien ne marche, quand on va faire des démarches.
Rien a foutre de vos manifs, rien que tu gueule et que tu marche, ça change rien.
Ils se foutent de ta gueule et tu marche, ça te sert à rien.
Plus récent s'en sort, même s'ils dominent faut pas se laisser faire,
Chacun son domaine, persiste dans ce que tu sais faire.
N'en fais pas trop gros, fais-toi au bon niveau (Wow!)
Maintient la température de ton cerveau. 
Chacun son destin. 
Trace la route c'est pas le moment de se garer, 
Quitte à être distant, je vais pas détourner parler c'est garer. 

J'ai fait de ma vie un rêve, et de mon rêve, une réalité. 
Comprends pourquoi je fais pas de sentiments. 
Les cœurs saignent, et les regrets, on se les partage. 
De mes textes, mes œuvres pleuvent mes larmes et mon sang.

On s'en sort, tu m'écoute plus là
Désenchanté quand je vois une famille fondre en larmes. 

On compte que sur nous, mais sur nous on compte peu hein.

Rohff,"Démarrage hold-up, de la première à la sixième, je viens mettre ça au top 
Plus rien ne peut m'arrêter, ni rappeur ni Robocop 
N'aie pas peur, quand je pilote le mic, rien que j'passe des rapports 
Turbo diesel sport injection, avec principe, espoir, ambition 
Sur un bon son, on cherche pas le hit, 
On veut tout prendre sans se faire prendre, on allume comme dans 'Heat' 
Sauf que je ne suis pas Robert De Niro, je t'affranchis, ça monte au cerveau 
Un truc de dingue, l'engin 9.4, quatre cent chevaux 
Je passe le rapport de notre vie à l'oral 
Selon l'humeur du jour, l'état du moral 
Faut que je respire de l'air frais man, ce qui m'inspire est formel 
C'est la spirale infernale, qui m'aspire à faire mal au micro, 
Je suis fort man, j'ai débuté comme Mike Tyson, 
Compte durer comme Georges Foreman, comme Batman 
Rohff forever, Vitry fever, plutôt réaliste que rêveur 
Et si mes rimes sont mal comprises, 
C'est parce que rien que j'accélère, accélère, j'ai la putain de reprise 
Le rap c'est mon périph que je prends à sens inverse 
Avec les pleins phares la nuit, à 2002 kilomètres heure

C'est du direct, droit au but comme Trézéguet

On veut tout prendre sans se faire prendre, on allume comme dans 'Heat' 

Turbo parce que je suis speed, diesel pour l'endurance,
Sportif injection pour la concurrence 
Au rétro, un coup de gaz, tu disparais de l'écran 
Pour Rocco sous écrou, avec les crocs et du cran 
Fais danser la haine comme Vince, on se multiplie comme les Grimlins 
Bouge en sous-marin comme les Marin's 
Je ne vendrais pas ma vie aux médias, comme Hélène Ségara 
Qui elle-même s'égare quand elle entend ça 
Elle aime ses gars rares, comme toutes demoiselles 
On braque le rap, on prend l'oseille,
On fait ce qu'on a à faire sans faire de zèle 
Sans prendre des ailes, devant les cris désireux des groupies 
Tous créatures de Dieu, y'a pas de VIP

Sur un bon son, on cherche pas le hit,

MC 4 motions, toutes options, Rohff en rodage 
Prototype de l'année, d'après les sondages 
Flow à direction assistée dans les virages 
Attention ne traînez pas dans les parages 
Censuré au salon de l'auto, style illégal man 
Pour tous mes potos sous le porche, personne m'égale man 
Même pas les Porsche, je suis pas un hasa, je roule droit, 
Pas de vague, pas de drogues, 
Ni champ, ni frime, nique les modes, tout ce qui est en vogue 
Elvira, bouge tes airbags, tes fesses sur un son à l'ancienne, à la Scarface 
C'est la Rohff sensation, ouech ma gueule 
Je te fais danser les condés comme Georges Michael

C'est pour mes ros du 92
Fais péter les watts en 95

Neuf trois connection baba
Housni, bonhomme est l'attitude
Du mic je tire dessus et ton corps titube
Catastrohff, je suis venu chanter mon petit tube
Je lâche un missile SCUD en direct de la banlieue sud
Si t'as la plaque 9.4 t'arrives à Bastille, aux Champs-élysées
Rafales verbalisées, baisse les vitres, fais-les baliser
Le Val de Marne mon deuxième pays j'ai escaladé le Mont-Mesly
Atteint le sommet l'Abbaye 94 mousqueton
Accueilli avec des pochetons de ske-kun
Des combats de pits qui aiguisent leur chicos sur le béton
Sorti du dépôt, je remets les lacets au palais
Y a pas plus cheum que vos balcons je m'arrache a la ville du joint
Joinville Le Pont dédicace aux Sablières
Malgré un manque de respect en boîte
Je reçois un verre dans la bouche et je te couche avec une droite
Donc on est quitte c'est pour mon équipe des Bordières
Belax, Bibax, La Section, des Crapulax en petite excursion
À 300 km dans les raves en forêt à fourguer du tcherno
Des tripes en carton à la mettre à ces enfoirés de pecnos
Fuck la Techno c'est de la musique de drogué
Par les lassos contre un portable mon album se fait troquer
En calèche, les graines du bitume ont fleuri
Évasion à la kalash à Fresnes c'est pour le D1 à Fleury
C'est pas la Floride, ça frôle la folie, cagoule, prolik
Derrière les thunes, comme un chien derrière les frolics
Foulek mais toujours poli solide à bord d'un bolide
Coup de frein à main avec une hanzet un peu jolie
Ça tourne pas pour viol ou des trucs péraves que des trucs braves
À la Montreuil, c'est la chourave avant la bicrave

Besoin de renforts aux Alouettes
Tire derrière les volets de ta fenêtre
C'est pas net aux planètes,
Maison-Alfort ville et les banlieues limitrophes
Mes rimes défilent c'est pas du morse
Morfle c'est Catastrohff qui t'offre un tour dans le coffre
Coffre mon CD en retour de perm en semi liberté
La vraie richesse est dans le Dìn corrige ton orgueil
Pense plus à la mort à l'accueil dans le cercueil un clin d'oeil
Au braquage de la Brink's à Arcueil tah la Heat c'est le mythe
Pshatou ceux qui ont désarmé, menotté les schmits
Selmik essaye de franchir notre seuil par Bicêtre
Avec un peu de chance les Martinets feront preuve d'hospitalité
Sinon pas loin y a les urgences pour te faire hospitaliser
Électrochoc, scalpel, aussi vont te brutaliser
Te scolariser à l'école, la ruée vers l'or, une vie de juif
S'alcooliser, fumer en avoir ""hagra"" finir a Villejuif
Devenir la risée des sales gamins
Détruits par la tôle, la fiole, faire des sacs a mains
À la trentaine se mettre en cavale tout seul, shrab Ben Laden
Sur une 103 avec un douze, un pack de 12 d'Heineken
Qui tape un poste tape une Poste
Fait mal au crâne au chef de poste
Y'a pas de bavures, nous ça riposte
Ils nous arriveront jamais à la cheville t'as vu
Je connais je vis la rue de ??
Lamartine jusqu'à Chevilly Larue
Sur la N7 accélération pour la 9.4 célébration
Compteur bloqué en agglomération
Même les motards freinent, pas d'amélioration
Malgré Sarko ??
C'est pour les cités de Frènes et l'Hay-les-Roses

À la pompe à essence d'Ivry
Conduite en état d'ivresse sur le son, Mafia Kainfri
9.4 ton pire ennemi depuis Jacques Mesrines ça part en vrille
À la cité hoche les Pyramides Barbusse d'Ivry ou de Vitry
Villes de communistes même avec Tati la vie est triste
Toute la jeunesse au Hrebs rien que des récidivistes
Un nid de braqueurs, dragueurs même les ripoux et les femmes flics
Préfèrent bosser dans le secteur que se faire ken par leur époux
Criminel pour Choisy Gabriel Jacques Cartier Yeah
Là où ça saute du 4e étage
Quand la BAC attaque au bélier
Je prends en otage le rap Français
Je le met paro comme aux saules de la Sablière, Alfred De Musset
Passe le Salam aux cités de Villeneuve Le Roi,
Saint-Georges ou Bonneuil
Joues pas l'Américain les mecs verront toujours d'un bon oeil
Enferme les chbebs, les poucaves faut les humilier
S'ils disent : « Rohff aide-nous, tu sais
Un coup de genou pour Cilliers les hautes noues »
Si y a embrouille entre cités faites la paix,
Le commissariat craint l'émeute au Bois l'Abbé
Voila les bananes qu'on te met ça baise tout
Même Geneviève de Fontenay
Pour Sucy, Boissy, Neuilly et le Val de Fontenay
J'étais au zoo de Vincennes pour un parloir sauvage
Si tu fais les fils surveille pour Charenton et Limay
Stoppez les teintures et la laque
Ça fait faux rebeus, faux blacks

Au regard des gens, qu'est-ce tu ferais
Tu dis que c'est pour toi, c'est à tes frais
Style t'as de l'argent toujours frais
C'est pas vrai, t'es qu'un gros mytho
De là-haut, les élites scrutent la masse,
C'est fou comme le monde est embourbé dans la nasse,
Les temps n'ont pas changé, le pouvoir est toujours le même
À la force brute, aux grosses voix, aux belles femmes, à ce qui se voit
Et cela depuis des siècles, sous le grand chapiteau du monde
C'est le cirque pris dans le cercle des dompteurs, des clowns,
Un savant fou, gourou d'une secte qui veut instaurer les clones,
Manipulateurs de gènes, une femme qui ne s'accepte pas vit dans la gêne,
Se met au silicone, au collagène, ok c'est ton choix,
Y a pas plus valorisant que la beauté intérieure le vis pas, c'est la foi
Et coule de source t'aveugle de ses faisceaux,
Brille comme une pierre précieuse au fond d'un ruisseau
Le diable aux pinceaux, colorie la terre de rouge sang,
De vert sky dollars, au rose porno, je préfère le noir foulard,
Je suis un penseur libre qui chante pour que ton coeur vibre
Si l'apparence d'une star t'enivre fuck les VIP
Au milieu de toute cette déco, les vrais valeurs témoignent,
Je suis comme le dernier écho d'une symphonie qui s'éloigne
Au refrain
4 bouteilles en boîte : un oeuf dans le frigo
Un matelas par terre : tu roule en Merco
Tu passes pour être sûr qu'on t'a vu, tu repasses
Tu refais le tour, apparences trompeuses comme au concours.
On voit bien que tu fais le gosse beau avec tes contours,
Tu t'aimes tellement que tu aimerais te faire l'amour
Je rime pour la foule anonyme, les apparences victimes,
Ceux qui supportent les handicaps ou les pseudonymes moqueur
Macaque, bougnoule, fuck le racisme,
Gros lard pour l'obésité, biglouche pour le strabisme,
Ça fait des années que les apparences te trompent comme ton mari,
Ou comme ta femme avec ton meilleur ami
Girl tu croyais avoir trouvé l'homme de ta vie
Beau, intelligent, drôle, tu le suis dans une piaule et voilà qui te viole
Dans une mer plate, tu verras pas arriver le requin,
Comme le sida sous la peau d' un mannequin

Des langages des dicos, moi je vous nargue avec mon argot,
Je suis un leader pas un suiveur comme Rantanplan,

Je suis pas bousillé par les carrés pleins de : yo man, négo bling bling
Tatoué des orteils à la nuque
C'est mettre la forme mais au fond t'es un bouffon,
Comme un flic t'as l'air sûr de toi, t'es rien qu'un terrien rassure-toi,
Je veux pas faire la bise au showbiz
Écarter les jambes des Bains-Douches
Et jouer les femmes fatales, elles sont besoins d'un bain de bouche,
Être à la mode, marcher avec un footballeur,
Apparemment j'ai plus d'affinité avec des fous que de branleurs,
J'aime la vitesse c'est super simple, j'aime la vitesse
Je suis preneur pour un V12 dans une super 5

Sur les excréments de BNC
Les rappeurs souffrent de problèmes de personnalité
Vas-y raccroche ton hardcore n'a pas de tonalité
Placard rap, braque à rap, calamité
Lâche-moi la grappe, moi je te braque?pas l'amitié
C'est manier les mots par les?de flingues
Te flinguer pour te faire cracher tes baltringues
T'as déjà pas de?, j'aime pas comment t'es fringué

Partout c'est doré, des lustres en cristal, Bollywood style
Sur le tapis rouge ils ont brodé mes freestyles
Devant la danse des courtisanes aux bracelets 24 carats
Déjoue leur mascarade, j'ai cramé leur vice sous le mascara
Elle veulent briser notre ménage mais peuvent rien changer
Parce que toi et moi c'est danger

Toi et moi c'est sacré on fait plus d'entrées que le Taj Mahal
On met tout le monde high, aïe, aïe, aïe,
T'es dans mon délire ça te plaît

Et dans les bacs, ils eurent beaucoup d'enfants dangereux

Vous le savez pas depuis le début ça va pas et tous ce que j'ai vécu 
Wallah vous allé voir j'ai du kérosène dans le réservoir 
Je me voyais pas danseur ou choriste je voulais être seul
Comme un pianiste pas de calibre pour 2 je suis pas venu en touriste 

Il me faut représenté 
Posé ma pierre a l'édifice 
C'est ma manière de existé 
Il me faut représenté 
Resté fidèle a ce que je suis 
La seule chose a vendre c'est mon cd 
 
Je veut pas que ce morceau me donne une raclé comme le talion 
Je lui rend ce kil me donne 

La musique est trop bonne 
La mélodie est mignonne 
Quand la basse ronronne je lui donne 

Je chante depuis mes premier soulier 
Pose pas de question kan je fredonne la la la la la la la 

Pendant mon absence la concurrence a pris confiance 
Quand le chat n'est pas la les souri dansent 
Y a de l'ambiance 
Que se soi la star ac lé l5 les pop star 
Les what for pour faire ce que vous faite ça a l'air dur 
Ça fouette fort chanté que dé reprises 
Ça demande beaucoup d'effort 
Sur lé plateau top single ils attendent billy troford 
Mais tsé k'avek rohff faut pas déconné ça fait zizir o mien 
Il me serre la main en me disant bsartek wallah bien 

Il me faut représenté 
Posé ma pierre a l'édifice 
C'est ma manière de existé 
Il me faut représenté 
Resté fidèle a ce que je suis 
La seule chose a vendre c'est mon cd 

Représenté sur le beat un challenge rohff feat wallen corrosif comme l'acide 
Représenté les jaloux veulent kané
Rohff plus efficace que le suicide tu me reconné 
Hip hop ma boeme wallen wallen t'entraîne dans ses rapides faut m'excusé
Dans la vie je reste timide mais sur le beat j'ai le charisme d'un leader 

Tranchant que lame plus touchant que l'arme mon micro mon arme 
Je défouraille du plus profond de mon âme 
Je vient cassé la barre 
J’attends pas mieux de ta place si tu conteste je suis le best 
Je suis venu prendre ma part et le reste qui tu veut teste? 
Vitry m'a construit défonce comme les instruis 
Mon sort sans être instruit 
Rohff c'est désastreux 
J’apprends de mieux en mieux a utilisé mes pouvoirs 
Faut être bigleux pour pas le voir quand c'est rohff ça a rien a voir 

Il me faut représenté 
Posé ma pierre a l'édifice 
C'est ma manière de existé 
Il me faut représenté 
Resté fidèle a ce que je suis 
La seule chose a vendre c'est mon cd

Il me faut représenté 
Posé ma pierre a l'édifice 
C'est ma manière de existé 
Il me faut représenté 
Resté fidèle a ce que je suis 
La seule chose a vendre c'est mon cd

Il me faut représenté
Posé ma pierre a l'édifice

Rohff,"Refrain
9.3 plus 9.4 code 187 flow
2004 on met ton rap à 4 pattes gros
Si t'as des couilles on les castre
Y a que de la haine au menu
Comme Bush s'en bat les couilles de l'ONU
9.3 plus 9.4 code 187 flow
Dans le rap on casse le délire comme Sarko
Si t'as des couilles on les castre
Y a que de la haine au menu
Comme Bush s'en bat les couilles de l'ONU
Excuse-moi, si le 9.4 foudroie, on arrive fous de rage,
Va te faire foutre toi Kamelancien, Houssni, flow à la Ben Laden
94 nous tester ? Mec c'est pas la peine
On zigzague, 187 sur la zik zinc
Mec je suis zinzin, j'écris mes textes à Bagdad
Une grenade venue tout droit d'Al Kaïda
9.4 plus 9.3 arrête de jouer le caïd là
Tu revois ta vie, ex-voleur de ture-voi t'as vu
Je connais pas ta vie, mais je la reconnais sur ta vue
Kamelancien, j'arrive terrifiant
Les keufs pieds au plancher arrivent vérifiant
Face aux warriors, l'ancien Rohff te met hors-piste
Pronostique une boucherie comme dit-on hors diss
Si ton rap c'est de l'argent, le notre c'est de l'or fils
En fait moi j'ai rien à foutre d'être artiste
Tu parles trop, à croire que tu vas tout brûler
Avec du whisky dans la pêche, je te baise ta race toi et ton couplet
J'ai pas le temps pour ces putes qui tiennent le micro comme une bite
Ici ça rap comme ça tire, et brise tes os comme une batte
Département mes couilles, qu'est-ce tu crois, toi et ton crew
Dans la rue c'est pour de vrai, si tu blagues tu prends des coups
Merde, pose le micro on va te le rentrer dans le boule
Gros mytho t'as pas de vécu ferme ta gueule tu nous saoule
9.3 - 9.4 code 187 l'automatique pour les grosses putes habituées à faire du zèle
Je parle peu, quand je l'ouvre c'est qu'on m'a pas payé
Gros zoulou si tu t'en sors c'est que mon arme s'est enrayée
Change de putes, change de potes, change de porte, change d'époque
Pok pok popopok, tire ou pose à terre ton glock
Au refrain
C'est crime molotov, nique ton père en lover
Come over, je move, dans l'cockpit R.O.H.2.F
Carnivore sur la viaux arrache tes enfants, t'es fou
Je les ai vu, toi tu creuses ça c'est la vie
Ça fait (cric) 93 (cric) pour 94 (cric), retrans(cric)
Au coupe-coupe ça fais (cric) (cric)
J'connais les crap craquent gros et tu vois zi(cric)

T'es ou ? ah t'es là(cric) prends ton souffle(cric)
J'ai bicrave ton masque à gaz (cric) et voilà que je te gaze (cric)
187 code criminel, troué à l'opinel
T'es mort VIP direction la morgue tu rigoles (kr kr kr)
T'as trop maig-( kr kr kr ) à force de moque-( kr kr)
Je t'ai taillé un sourire commercial
Grouille demande au petit frère c'est qui qu'a buter Hitler
Ils te répondront : Scarface dedans est le cerveau
Ouvre les portières fait péter le son
À l'unisson nous dansons
Pour te localiser j'offre une rançon
Je roule en première, pépère !
Ça klaxonne derrière, nique sa mère, c'est la rue à mon père
Et hop ! j'accélère dès que je te vois traverser
Oh ! je t'ai pas vu, excuse de t'avoir renversé
Je suis pas DMX, je vais verser, pas essuyer ce beat
T'aurais aimé kicker sur ce beat putain t'es qu'un suce bite
Ça collerait pas, sois logique c'est simple
Bouffon mets pas du 6.35 dans un colt 45
Donc cesse de me parler de tess, de 16,
D'équipe, de tass, de guez, de rabz, de calibre car je te baise
Sous gingembre, du genre une balle dans la jambe
Pas de sécu, on risque de me tirer une balle dans la jambe
Prêt à dégainer, j'ai du sang sur les mains en guise de henné
Donc cesse de te gonfler t'es "" éné "", regarde comment on fait
Ton hardcore c'est du toc, ton flow sature
Mes rimes traversent les époques comme mes balles traversent les murs
Yo man ! tu rapes comme une tortue, tes fond te tord en tunes
M'écouter pour toi c'est tordu
Terroriste lyrics, c'est Ben Laden qu'a fait ce son de bâtard
Maquetter au Pakistan, l'âgé c'est le Mola Omar

Rohff,"Y a trop de sensations à gérer ici, l'amour, la haine, 
Pour certains les drogues, l'alcool, les fantômes du passé nous traquent
Heywa 

Pourquoi ai-je si mal au ventre? Moi qui me vante d'être un homme dur, 
Pourquoi ai-je si froid quand ils ventent? Quelque chose me torture, 
Me bouffe l'oxygène, plus d'appétit quand je déjeune, 
Petit à petit je ressens les coups comme si j'étais plus jeune, 
Je sais plus où me mettre dois-je admettre, 
Être affaiblit, caché entre les lignes de ma lettre, 
Perçois mon mal-être, en cette lettre, 
Douleur atroce, je perds mes forces, je craque tellement je suis croc, 
En train de craquer, je tire une tête de croque-mort, l'amour m'a drogué, 
Le cur pourtant anesthésié a trouvé le nerf 
Vivant overdose et mon coeur un mort vivant, 
Je voulais faire bien pour changer, 
M'éloigner des dangers comme un voyou de se ranger, 
Rongé par le passé, triste vécu, je rêvais d'affection, de protection, pour me sentir en sécu', 
Blazé par la routine qui m'use, blazé par les boites de nuit, 
Toujours assis quand tu t'amuses fatigué des mauvaises news. 

Les fantômes du passé me traquent comme un shlak, sortit de cure, à chercher, 
Un gars me propose du crack faut pas je craque, 
Remues pas le couteau dans la plaie quand je perds tout mon sang, 
Le regard perçant quand tu le vois tu le ressens. 

Les fantômes du passé me traquent comme un shlak, sortit de cure, à chercher, 
Un gars me propose du crack faut pas je craque, 
Remues pas le couteau dans la plaie quand je perds tout mon sang, 
Le regard perçant quand tu le vois tu le ressens.

Je moisis pas en prison, mais je cohabite avec la poisse, 
Mon passé braque mon présent, le futur bloqué dans le sas, 
Resasse les souvenirs, les bons les mauvais délires, 
Recyclé en B.E.P car je ressemble à mon avenir, 
Pendant que j'explose de rire tu peux compter mes chicos, 
On m'a dit reste comme ça, c'est toi, c'est le charme du ghetto, 
Si j'avais pas vécu ici j'aurais été quelqu'un d'autre, 
Si j'avais pas manqué mon père j'aurais fait beaucoup moins de fautes, 
Mêmes avec les scies, on bouffe du bois crois moi, 
J'ai de quoi raser l'Amazonie moi et mon autre moi Housni, 
Chacun sa notion de la vie, ses passages avides, sa maturité, 
Ses intérêts ses poches vides que Dieu nous guide 
Entre croyants et non-croyants, comme un dépend 
Entre voyants et non-voyants, mais voyons, 
Toutes les té-ci veulent s'en sortir comme Sami Nasri, 
Marqué à vie, je compte plus les rayures sur ma carrosserie. 

Les fantômes du passé me traquent comme un shlak, sortit de cure, à chercher,

C'est dur de me donner de l'amour, en recevoir peu en échange, 
Où qu'on consomme ton humour, et ta tristesse dérange, 
Manque de respect peu de gentillesse, 
Sauf quand ça t'arrange, qui me rend si énervé et étrange, 
C'est tous ces soucis qui te rongent et qui te plongent, 
Dans la solitude malgré la foule, 
Tout le monde pense qu'à sa gueule, et ton besoin se fait refoule, 
Tu te replis sur toi-même et ce qui me fout les boules, 
C'est que tu me fout la haine alors j'inspire à être cool, 
Je suis dans le sous-sol de l'amertume et tu me captes pas, 
Ne jacte pas sur ma vue c'est que tu m'acceptes pas comme je suis, 
Je reviens de loin épargne moi tes caprices, 
Y a du mérite je tiens la route avec mes deux pieds motrices, 
Grâce à Dieu, je surmonte les épreuves ma preuve de sciences et de preuves, 
Sa manière de faire qui font des rappels, 
Car ils font tout ce qu'ils peuvent pour sauver ses idées sont neuves, 
Quand je vais crever mes ouvres mes musiques seront veuves.

Rohff,"Aucune somme d'argent ne sera suffisante pour acheter notre âme
Peace And Love

J'suis en peace and love
Pour les loups et les louves
En manque de love au levé
Light backs move dans la couve
Tout l'monde move
Dans un coup d'feu y a du groove
Dans la roulette russe tu m'cherche tu m'trouve
J'viens pas loin d'être groove
Y a pas de Charles Ingalls
Que des ""laisses crèves""

L'aider ? les pince pour une greffe crève
Y a que dans les rêves qui y a les paix
C'est pour ça qu'on aime dormir
J'en arrive à l'envie de ceux qui repose en paix
Trop d'innocents au cimetière
Pour un bout de terre ta maison saute
Les bombes nucléaires n'estiment pas la vie des autres
Une vengeance aujourd'hui une autre
Sa ne fini plus pour les miens et les tiens qu'on ne vois plus
Trop de tension, de pollution, de manque d'éducation
Trop de gens savent pas conduire, trop d'impôts, extorsion de fond
Provocation de bouffons qui prennent la mouche, biglouche
Te regardant travers, fouette de la bouche
Trop de conformistes, disparités sociales, injustices
Trop d'armes en circulation, violent, près action de peace

Dur d'être peace and love dans un monde où il faut se battre
? y a pas de place pour un loup d'hier
On vit dans un monde où y faut tous les jours qu'on passe
Prems à la garde à la guetté pour un loup d'hier

Lundi, 17 h je marche le cur ensoleillé
Malgré ma bonne volonté je me fait bousculée
Check in feeling on a minute on peut devenir des ennemies
Mais finalement nos regard s'évitent mais la semaine n'est pas fini

Comment gagner le prix Nobel
Les dictateurs était des rebelles
Le mal ressemble au bien
Et les vilaines sont les belles
J'aimerais y croire

C'est mort depuis le début de l'histoire
C'est le jour où l'homme a compris ce que voulait dire le pouvoir
Divisé pour mieux régner à trop d'exaction
Pour le rendre pas compte des fusions, d'appropriation de religion
Comment mettre un terme à ceux qui sont sur lanterne
Celui qui gouverne, le moins gouverne, le moins qui nous berne
Y a autant de bouquins pour s'instruire,
De matières pour se détruire,
Nous induire en enduire en erreur aller enfin on passe au malheur
Pas de carrés vides dans les mosquées
Descends de ton piédestal
Je refuse d'obtempérer quand la police est brutale
Avant on nous reproché de pas savoir s'exprimer
Mais qu'on a appris à le faire on nous pris de la fermé
Ceux qui veulent nous viré de la France réfléchissez 2 second
Loin de nourrir l'économie on fait gagner la couper du monde

Dur d'être peace and love
Être en perte le soir même
Ne pas faire payer ses problème
Et toujours de mauvaise humour

Dur d'être peace and love dans un monde où il faut se battre
? y a pas de place pour un loup d'hier
On vit dans un monde où y faut tous les jours qu'on passe
Prems à la garde à la guetté pour un loup d'hier

Peace, c'est pour tout les rancuniers,
Les orgueilleux, les sales caractères,
Hein y a de la place pour tout le monde sur cette Terre,
Hein on a toujours besoin de quelqu'un,
C'est pour ça que personne s'enterre tout seul,
On est tous des frères et surs, faut positivé, canalisé ses nerfs, hé oua peace",Dur d'Être Peace

J'fais mon entrer au port du rap comme le Queen Mary 
Succession de drame de quoi faire chialer Mary J 
J'suis monstrueux comme Mauresmo Amélie 
C'est l'son que j'merite comme Tony Parker en départ en Amérique 
Tu t'prend pour moi c'est pas pé-pom comme Hillary 
J'suis inquiétant comme un ennemi a ton mariage devant la mairie 
J'viens faire progresser la musique 
Faire passer le message prendre mon fric pour construire mon Afrique 
J'suis pas d'ces rappeurs excentriques qui sucent le jack
Qui font leur vedette en boite bouteille tass a leur table stop 
J'arrive du bled la vie m'a mit une claque 
Ils ont dit que d'la merde t'es égaré tu joues les mac 
J'sais c'est quoi la misère y'en a qui on vécu pire 
Alors j'vais pas dramatiser j'espère clamser sans souffrir 
Même une balle dans la tête f'rait l'affaire j'ai pas peur 
Pourquoi s'mentir d'une manière ou d'une autre arrive ton heure

J'veux pas perdre mon calibre pour cause c'est ta mère qui rembourse 
C'est chaudard comme une promenade qui t'course 
J'veux être commercial comme 2Pac être coté en bourse 
Rien a foutre moi c'est pas les jaloux qui m'font les courses 
On m'dit ne pas calculer ceux qui parlent ouais mais j'les baise tous 
Les mecs qu'apprécient Rohff ils savent pourquoi 
J'suis juste un vaillant pas rappeur qui s'prend pour un you-voi 
Les anciens m'ramenent leur nièce pour que j'leur signe des dédicaces 
Ils s'en foutent du rap eux ça leur fait plaisir rlass 

C'est R-O-H-2-F mc tu peux pas m'test
Moi j'parle jamais dans l'zef le rap français est pris de vitesse

Moi j'ai rien hériter ma cote de popularité ne peux en aucun hériter ma personnalité 
C'qui m'arrivais bien ou de mal c'était mérité 
J'assume une famille j'dois faire preuve de démérité 
J'suis déterminé, né pour dominer 
Numero uno même qu'on m'a pas nominé 
Toujours fidèle aux principes aux devises rétrospectives 
Me mettre a snifer comme toi c'est pas dans mes perspectives 
J'suis incorruptible influençable toujours sportif 
Pour tous ces gens qui m'soutienne comme un soutif 
Comme le periph j'encercle Paris sous les bombes
Succombe sous les décombres sur mille kilomètre a la ronde

Me rabaisser à ton niveau c'est marcher a reculons 
Fais peter l'son si ta place les ch mon marteau est un pilon

Les délinquants les narco trafiquant, 
On ve rotte-ca comme l'état mais rien qu'nos frère tombe, 
Esplombe craigne pas c'est lenfer les suplices de la tombe, 
Une journée de plus en banlieue rien a faire comme d'hab, 
T'appelle un poto de galere une vie de misérable, 
En pleine après midi tu vien te réveiller, 
Le visage enflé rien pour t'égayer 
Le ciel est gris, 
Tout les jours c'est dimanche rien qu'tu maigris, 
Pourtant rien qu'tu mange les soucis te ronge t'rend des gris, 
Tu crache des glaires toxic, 
Vomis du liquide nocif, 
Par voix oral ou anal t'est maladif en manque de bif, 
Pret à faire le mal dans le mal comme escroquer, 
Au risque de finir estropier, 
Faire fumer l'escroquer,

Se remmetre de sa soirée en fesant la bise au hragal, 
Qui entretienne leur réputation quand ds la crapulrie 
Avec un humour déplacer dont seules les crapules rit, 
Sa réjouit les ânes voir les autres faire les gogoles, 
Les grandes gueules qui te font passer le temps rien que tu rigole, 
Mais finiront allongées au sol, 
Avec une balle logée dans le crane, 
Enfin quelquechose la dedans toi qu'avait rien dans l'crane, 
En plus ils raconte que d'la merde ils ont la cervelle en panne, 
Moi les mitos m'font mal au crane, 
Poto il me faut un doliprane,

On baise la garde a v' comme un clodo, 
T'arrive menoter péter aux urgences avec des croc de crados, 
On ne sait même plus parler je sais que vous vous en fichez,

Dans les reportages de condés on ne fait que s'afficher, 
Justifier les clichés,

On est tous des maillons faibles c'est désolant comme notre Q.I, 
Et meme nos petites reus deviennent des kaï faut leur mettre des baffes, 
Elle joue les chaudes en centre de reéducation sorti de la maaf, 
Devienne des meufs a voyous des michtonneuses à fond dans la came, 
Des boîtes branchées de paname au festival de Cannes, 
Elles oublient qui elles sont de qui elles viennent, 
D'ou elles viennent tiennent, 
Peu de choses de leur mères elle pensent qu'a faire les chiennes, 
Se tortiller certaines refuse de se servir de leur deux mains, 
De peur d'abimer leur vernis et se sont les mères de demain, (hein) 
Ses graves comment l'argent à évincer les vrais valeurs, 
Du haut dealeur au voleur, 
Se repentir avant le malheur, 
Et s'écarter des troupeaux contaminer qui rejète les précèpes, 
Rien qu'on accumule les péchés qu'on indignes nos ancètres, 
Plus de diplôme ni de formation plus de carrière sportif, 
Pour rester actif, 
Monte une assos' à but lucratifs, 
Tu peut etre coursier livrer des pizzas à domicile, 
Porter des cartons ? au marcher ouais de vigile, 
Sinon t'on bras s'illicite mais pas en quinze minutes, 
Les smicards les batards te félicite quand tu débute, 
Tu sais pertinament que tu tfra péter ya pas de combine, 
Tes parents ta copine, 
Passent soixante douze heures à la crim, 
Emprunte photo traitée au labos, 
Les balances sauvent leur peau, 
Colabo' des pont invéstigation a l'hispo, 
Tu démmare sur les chapeaux de roues sans chrono, 
Vivre tout ce temps pour mourir rée-bou sur des tonneaux, 
Une pensée au sucide et aux mitar au lacets, 
Dépassez par les événements lassée de ce destin glacée, 
Les closes trop frustrés ce qui brule leur cellules, 
Partent tout seul en promenade s'auto mutile pour une pillule, 
Taf une pièce de thèatre dans les coulisses sa ricane, 
Les mêmes anciens idolâtres qui t'avance de la cam, 
En centre de détention en caval jusqua la préscription, 
En prévisoire tenue en laisse par le comité de probation, 
Les braqueurs font la queue devant les banques c'est sans espoirs, 
Deux trois dans la journée butine au comptoir, 
Aux assises c'est les enchères qui dit mieux, ""10 15 ans 20ans""

Bien le thelematon dans la poche, 
Ta rater le coche, 
Ton destin n'a jamais lever le pied sur la ville de gauche, 
A deux quatre vingts sur la A6 si si si sans freins, 
Sous flash flashé par le proc choriste du juge au refrain, 
Et ta femme te remplacera par un type du même type qu'est ce tu peux faire, 
Il l'acompagnera au parloir srhab t'est son frere, 
Ton co-détenu c'est avec qui elle couche, 
Qui est la touche, 
Tu pense à elle tu touche, 
T'est game over sur la touche, 
Pour ta daronne c'est bien plus douloureux qu'un valoir fantôme, 
Elle culpabilise or c'est la rue qui ta filer le symptôme, 
T'en veux a ton baveux il en demande toujours plus, 
Pour fumer faut te coffrer jusqua t'dilater l'anus, 
Moi je peux pas te dire j'en ai rien a battre, 
Mes frere se rabattent, 
Du coté du diable et vivent que pour se habbate, 
Pour une tasse ils sabotent pour un client il crabote 
A coup d'sabate sans vendre ses pattes, 
Dans la violence veulent plus se battre, 
Maitenant ils s'abattent sans somation s'enbattent, 
La race c'est le pire c'est qu'on s'adapte, 
Plus le temps de ré-pleu il pleut les air max plein de gadoues, 
Ferme la porte du haut il caille wesh sinon t'est un gars d'ou, 
Chacun ses antécédents sont jugement son tempérament, 
Chacun son mandat son parloir son enterrement, 
Sa mère en deuil ses péchés sa salade, 
Ses hèssenetes sa cogite ne me raconte pas de salades, 
Les ghetto métiers restent illusoirs y en a pas un qu'aboutit, 
On gagne pas l'argent a l'assure de ces outils,

Rafermi t'est mauvaises passions,

Pour se ranger ya mieux que l'argent ya la religion, 
Se retirer des guettos légions, 
Pourquoi pas quitter la région, 
Quand t'est au bout du rouleau, 
Que le systeme met la tete sous l'eau, 
Soulée a chercher du boulot, 
Roulée des joins se faire interpeler, 
Par ces batards de poulet en chemins, 
Dans l'angoisse trainer la poisse comme un boulet, 
Comme un ancien qu'a couler, 
En chien qui se fait des roulée, 
Peur qu'on te dit frangin faut tailler avant de s'écrouler, 
Se faire trouée crouée à vie échouer, 
Vivre du RMI sans véritable ami pour te secourir ou te secouer (Héwa hein), 
Pour te changer ya pas de formules secrètes, 
Je suis pas la pour t'inciter mais pour te dire des choses concrètes, 
Avec véracité.",Message à la Racaille

Rohff,"J'ai pollué la mer du rap, c'est la marée noir,
J'ai englué vos mouettes et j'ai ""uèt"" des MC de Vitry au Koweït 
On est trop lié, rap de tôlier, la tu carbure au hydrocarbures, l'album un pétrolier. 
Qu’alimente les super-tankers, provoque le choc, suffoque, voila tous ce que supporte ton cœur. 
Je te fou le vertige, des gisements de rimes de prestige,
Explose les charts en ruines, vos carrières en vestige. 
Avant je pissais dans l’ascenseur, fessais des choses insensés, 
Maintenant j'trouve ca sans service, vendu, comme du sang, c'est
C'est toute la ville qui deal et qui vole, qui est au bout du rouleau, 
Touche a la famille, c'est bénévole pour faire le sale boulot. 
La, vous comprenez bien que vous rivalisez pas,
C'est comme perdre quelqu’un, au début vous réalisez pas. 
J'ai jaillis d'en dessous comme le pétrole, je triz-mé,
Moi j'ai pas attendu le rap pour plaire au tissmés. 

Y'a comme une odeur de souffre dans les parages,
On a le son qui transpire faut qu'on défonce les barrages. 
Nous on vient de la ou le mal nous incarcère,
Chaque jour on se lève comme si y avait tout a refaire. 

J'ouvre ma gueule quand faut se taire, parmis les hallstars des halls austères, 
Pour pas me rouiller, m'enrayer je suis sorti du holster. 
Je suis en major, je fais ce que je veux, je suis comme en indé, 
Je lève mon majeur, j'compte sur mon indexe, j'ai pas besoin d'aide. 
T'es dead si t'es peureux, j'vole la vedette de ceux qu'on tout pour eux, 
Même quand tu vois me marrer c'est douloureux. 
Dormir dehors, effleurer l'amour, froller la mort. 
Je viens défleurer les fleures des pétasses sur l'dancefloor. 
La faune et la flore sans clip, le quartier tellement chaud que tu bronze, 
Je suis dans la dream team sur le terrain on est plus que onze. 
Bosser dans la braque pour une retraitre en zonz,
Avec une plaque de fer, des vis plus une balle de 11 
C'est le désastre, j'authentifie le hardcore,
Je suis le contraste entre sfaire carresser et trouer le corp. 
Moi qui croyais que l'avenir c'était quelques parts gros,
Mon son s'en bat les reins comme un dealer d'héro. 

Y'a comme une odeur de souffre dans les parages,
On a le son qui transpire faut qu'on défonce les barrages. 
Nous on vient de la ou le mal nous incarcère,
Chaque jour on se lève comme si y avait tout a refaire. 

Mec regarde d’où on sort, ou vient des caves et des sous-sols,
Tu pourras toujours bloquer les portes, on jaillit comme le pétrole. 
On sera toujours en marge, un groupe de personnes en manque de sommeil ouais,
En gérant la taule, je veux du cash pour les miens en manque de soleil. 
Pieds et poings liés, on sort tu craque ? on finira bien par passer,
De l'autre coté des barricades. 
Et mec se qu'on veut c'est tout brûler, on va vider nos gerricans

Dig it Rohff check le mic, dégomme comme un strike, 
Tu te mange des baffes comme Tina Turner, appelle moi Hike. 
J'ai pas pris la grosse tete, c'est toi qui me calcule, 
T'aimerais qu'j'bascule mais meme somnambule,
Je tiens l'équilibre comme un funambule. 
On ratrappe pas bipbip, n'est pas la haine coyote, 
J'suis en sous-marin j'torpille ton yacht ptite fiotte. 
J'décolle de cap canaveral, j'ai du mettre les voiles,
J'ai perforé le ciel, soufflé ton étoile. 
C'est le retour du Jedi, j'suis le revers d'la médaille,
J'ai le SEEM d'un né racaille, MC fait pas ton G.I. 
J'ai la rage de l'espace, respire fort comme Dark Vador,

C'est la loi du sport de bouche, c'est dur a comprendre 
Mais ya plus d'regles même un 10 posé MC tu t'feras pendre 
On défouraille les armoires les petites et les grandes 
On respecte tout le monde comme on baise tout le monde 
Mais pourquois tu m'blame c'est la rue c'est infame 
Tu sais qu'les mecs carressent plus leurs armes que leur femme 
Demande un tête a tête c'est tout le monde qui ricane 
C'est humiliant et démodé mon gars no calme 
Une bécane et tu kanne alors qu'tavais pas envie 
Resteez reglo et respectueux vous restrez longtemps en vie

J'sais rien faire d'autre que rapper en défigurant 
Ferme tes fesses t'es qu'un figurant j'suis fulgurant 
Enfile une combinaison, j'rappe le corps brulant 
J'prend trop d'place dans l'mouv' mon style est corpulant 
Trop opulant, mon flow en gros plan c'est flou 
Trop violent pour ton crane comme si j'tenfoncait un clou 
Comme Sefyu mes lyrix sont noirs foncés, la lumiere marche pas 
J'sort le micro a lunetes infrarouge quand tu marches au pas 
T'es sur ma trajectoire au bout de l'index la victoire 
Mais bon j'continue a jouer avec toi 
Rien qu'tu parles sur moi même en dormant couzin 
J'suis l'marchant d'sable avec un 44 dans l'coussin 
J'suis viceralement irascible toujours promptuaire 
Touche a mes outils mon son ma caisse est somptuaire 
J'sent qu'tu eres dans mon sanctuaire 
Mon son est froid et si le mec désarme on est mortuaire 

J'ai la boucherie fume, mon halène pue la pourde

De toute façon nous sommes nés pour mourir 
T'es un grand garçon donc garde le sourire

Yen a qui auront tellement la haine quils pouront plus dormir 
Qui vivra vera au mois de mai il va s'passer un truc

Vous allez tous pisser le son comme des coups d'shlass dans la nuque 
Ca va faire tellement mal qutu te fera emputer l'uk 
En attendant la prochaine rumeur j'vais te dire un truc 
Si tu parles mal viens en face fils de pute 
Meme ceux qui parlent bien s'feront shooter 
Comme les suceuses qui aiment bien en rajouter 
Yaura pas d'jaloux ni d'chouchoutés 
Moi ouai j'suis shouté 
Dés que j'aparai j'doi comparaitre devant l'juge 
On s'croit a Avoriaze dans l'quartier et les petits font d'la luge 
Ya les stup' au tire fesse, déclanchent l'avalanche 
Ca s'barre en slalom sur des pistes noires de blanche 
La bac nous colle une tentative de meurtre 
Ils ont la rage de t'voir dehors 
Rien quils retourne ma caisse et voient le confort 
Tout le monde est acro des flingues 
Rien que des mecs en hachete avec le pouce et l'index 
Masturbent la gachete 
Ils t'laisse pas partir, ils t'laisse par terre 
Mach'Allah c'est l'paradis si tu meures martyre 
Mon retour c'est un meurtre prémédité 
Moi j'tire pas a coté, donc pourquois rééditer 
Dur d'rester un gars libre avec autant d'nervosité

Rohff,"15.12.77 ma date de naissance
Venu au monde en silence
Avec des grosses baffes
Pour faire chialer d'entrer la violence
Trop mignon, quand tu te revoie bébé sur une photo
En noir et blanc, ton père en patte d'eph avec une afro
De voir ta maman dans sa jeunesse
Ca me sert le cœur quand il évoque leur histoire avant que je naisse
Et après, mes 2 petits frères ont suivis
Puis vient la séparation qu'a marqué notre vie
Ma mère a pris son billet pour la France
Du Tiers-Monde c'était le paradis elle avait de la chance
On est resté avec papa et à la garde on nous a pris
Malgré lui le faisant passé pour quelqu'un de méchant jusqu'à ce qu'on ai peur de lui
Je me souviens de lui me tenant la main m'emmenant à la madrassah
Pour apprendre l'alphabet arabe et à écrire, c'est à lui que je dois ça
On a rejoint les cousins chez ma grand-mère maternelle au village
Sable rouge, pied nu, enfant salle et sauvage
A 10 sur un matelas pour 1 dans une maison de taule
On sait déjà retrouvé à 3 dans le berceau de mon petit frère tu rigoles
Y avait rien mais qu'est ce qu'on s'amusait bien
C'est dans la précarité que se consolide les rapports humains
Chaleureux quand t'entends parler la langue du pays
Fier d'être comorien, je sais d'où je viens, qui je suis
Si la vie est moche, les souvenirs lui donnent du charme
Quand je montais la passerelle de l'avion en saluant ma grand-mère en larme

Mes souvenirs (souvenirs) hantent ma vie
J'aimerai revenir dans mon enfance, dans l'insouciance

Mes souvenirs (souvenirs) hantent ma vie
J'aimerai revenir dans mon enfance, dans l'insouciance

84 j'arrive en France avec un gros ventre tout rikiki
Mon père c'est pas Monsieur DRUMONT comme j’envie la belle vie d'Vicky
Très impressionné par la transformation dixor
En 1 centième de seconde j'avais plus envie dti-sor
J'ratais le centre de loisir, pour Goldorak et Musclor
Les monstres blancs les comsocla et les cités d'or
J'passais mes 2 mois de vacances à Epinay-sur-seine
Chez mes cousins, à 15 minutes de la maison ghetto mais trop bien
On jouait à la chasse à l'homme, pas besoin d'tunes ni d'troc
Juste des bonbons, dessins animés on était croc
Insouciant du toboggan on aimait sauté dans le sable
Du tourniquet pour tout niqué
Aujourd'hui les gens sont méconnaissable
A l'époque, c'était 'Touche pas à mon pote'
Et depuis ça a bien changé, ils ont brûlé mon pote
Je rêvais d'un autre monde top50
Comme Mickael Jackson je voulais bouleverser le monde
85 je rentre en classe d'initiation de français
Avec la rage du bled le plus fort de l'école j'ai défonçai
Je fus un petit garçon dissipé et fougueux
A Paris on se croyait dans les Alpes, tellement l'hiver était rugueux
J'avais 8 piges au CP
Un air sur scène j'étais souvent au coin
J'étais pas con je gagnais des bons points
Sur la photo de classe j'étais le seul petit noir
J'ai bu la tasse dans le petit bain, cassé un bras à la patinoire
Ma grosse tête dans une cagoule, plein de crottes de nez BEURK
A l'époque de Matt Svilander et Stéphane Hettberg
86 y a eu cet accident de voiture j'ai mordu ma langue
Découpé en 2, j'étais à 8 points de soutures
Ne pas rapper 't'écoute Ricky' en ce moment tu kiff
Moi j'ai gueulé ma race attaché pour pas que la bouche ferme recousu à vif
J'avais pour colocataires des cafards les huissiers ont vu mes larmes
La vie est moche mais les souvenirs lui donnent du charme

Mes souvenirs (souvenirs) hantent ma vie
J'aimerai revenir dans mon enfance, dans l'insouciance

Mes souvenirs (souvenirs) hantent ma vie
J'aimerai revenir dans mon enfance, dans l'insouciance

87 j'arrive à St-Ouen avec un pull rouge pantalon vert
Un gros cartable, qui me faisait marché de travers
Je te met un peu au courant de mon histoire quand EDF nous coupait le courant
J'allumais la bougie de l'espoir
Sur mes baskets y avait un mec qui faisait du vélo
Pendant que mon gros orteil lui, te disait 'Hello!'
J'aimais bien le foot, faire la course, toujours d'aplomb
Un petit faible pour les blondes, mais pour être beau fallait être blond
De nos jours les blacks et les arabes ont la cote
Grâce au foot et au rap
Nique le FN qui boycotte
Je m'invitais dans les Boom, comment sa en salle attitude
Me donnait leur goûter pour que je les défende à l'étude
'Donne moi ta trousse de biff' exécution
Molardait ma main, pour retourner l'écusson
J'imitais la signature de ma mère quand le livret était mauvais
Avec le fil du poste elle me foutais, et moi je smurfais
Ca me faisait bien dormir la nuit les volets fermés
Une bonne pluie, mieux qu'un somnifère réveille à l'eau froide en hiver
Mes petits frères déboulent quand on déménage pour Vitry
A lépoque de black, boxe,snak
Mon voisin Mokobe m'a bousillé de hip-hop
De break, de hard-pop, la high la hightop
Avec le 113 on a monté notre premier groupe
J'ai connu Manu Key, Kerry James à l'époque des Troubs, des Fila
Je rencontre le 'Intouchable crew' à Choisy-Le-Roy
Orly choisit Vitry lié par le 183
Au début c'était l'union on faisait nos réunions sur l'toit
C'est devenu MAFIA K1 FRY, regarde moi bien toi
Et puis est venu l'époque de la délinquance la violence
La défonce, les conseils de disciplines, les renvoies, les galères
Ceci cela, mais bon tout ça c'est trop long,
En plus je t'ai déjà raconté dans les autres albums

Mes souvenirs (souvenirs) hantent ma vie
J'aimerai revenir dans mon enfance, dans l'insouciance

Mes souvenirs (souvenirs) hantent ma vie
J'aimerai revenir dans mon enfance, dans l'insouciance

Mes souvenirs (souvenirs) hantent ma vie
J'aimerai revenir dans mon enfance, dans l'insouciance

Mes souvenirs (souvenirs) hantent ma vie
J'aimerai revenir dans mon enfance, dans l'insouciance

Rohff,"Cesse de te prendre pour moi
À toutes les brigades du bitume
Spécial pour les virées nocturnes
C’est Catastrohff, original foulek style
Invincible le 9.4 toujours au contrôle

Rassou t’es pas mon pote
Je te fume tu crapotes, tu sabotes
Comme ton cas bosse, je te rabote donc ça me botte
Numéro 1 le son qui domine sur Paris
Tu te prends pour Rohff, t’as monté ta mafia kainri
Quoi les vers de terre veulent clash les boas
Quand je tape un footing la ville me salue comme Balboa
Rocky je suis aimé t’es qui tu touches pas une quille
Je suis plus dangereux que toi-même plâtré avec des béquilles

Refrain
Pauvre idiot, cesse de te prendre pour moi
Idiot, non t’es pas comme moi
Idiot, tu feras jamais le poids
Pourquoi te ressembler, je suis déjà trop moi
Pauvre idiot, cesse de te prendre pour moi
Idiot, non t’es pas comme moi
Idiot, tu feras jamais le poids
Pourquoi te ressembler je suis déjà trop moi

C’est ROH 2 F le flow qui met des oi-des
Qu’arrache le sol en bécane en kwad
Je déboule avec mes kicks mes sners et mes sup s
What’s up si tu crois que tu peux faire plus lourd suck my zeub
Ici tu te fais cahoter tes clés elle se font carotter
Si ton style c’était du coca y aurait pas de quoi roter
Tu veux ressembler à la rue, la rue n’a pas que des traînes
Et si tu fais de la chirurgie la rue te refera le portrait
Tes potes en retrait, comme à mon reusse qui met un sefa X-or
Balance son gsx-r voilà le sponsor bien vi-sert
À quoi bon sert de faire du free fight ju ji stu
Quand le canon t’observe, tu te chies dessus
C’est le niveau au-dessus dans le rap on est pas nés égaux
Parce que mon son se la raconte
Je me barre en égo fais gaffe aux négros
On n’a pas la même frappe j’ai dépassé ton corps
Je me démarque la place concorde je casse le délire à l’arc

Au refrain

Ton disque est rayé ton micro s’enraye
T’écoutes du Rohff tu te manges une bite de cheval dans l’oreille
Ceux qui veulent faire pareil recevront une convocation
Ok tu rapes mais faut payer la taxe d’imitation
Le rap ma vocation c’est pas de la rigolade ni la même limonade
Ou ma boisson coupée au sirop de grenade
T’as pompé mon style hein petit vilain
Arrête tes potes hein c’est pas le même charisme,
Demande à tes potes hein
En featuring, tu doutes hein, me redoutes hein
Je sais que tu m’écoutes hein
Hey yo check check ma face de ghetto youth hein
On joue dans le même club c’est moi qui marque les buts hein
L’pdg me suce la bite hein puis après tout
Je m’en bats les couilles écoute hein
Parle pas de gun, t’en as jamais vu un
Si oui c’était pas le tien
Encore faut-il avoir les couilles de s’en servir
…… ils veulent tous faire des roues
Si j’achète une Ferrari lourd ou une Lamborghini les zoulous

Tu séchait les cours, t'avait pas k'ca a faire, mais il s'avère, 
Que sur le visage de ta mère on voit combien elle en a souffert 
Pour les pions et les profs, tu fut l'élément perturbateur, 
Menaçant, violent, t'insultais l'éducateur, 
Bagarreur, Beau gosse, précoce, talentueux voleur 
D'une famille de caïds, t'en profite,
Tu fsé des admirateurs, des admiratrices, 
Génération de tournantes, celles qui fuguent pour toi,
Pendant que leur mère se tourmente, 
Laisse pas traîner ton fils, tu le reconnaîtrais pas,
Sous une cagoule, petit frère a grandi aussi vite qu'un Pitt bull 

Tu veux jouer, les chauds, t'aura jamais le dernier mot,
Tu meurt en héros, mais la vie continue 
Derrière les barreaux, tu fait pleurer la mama,
Tu meurs en héros, mais la vie continue 

T'aimais t'faire passer pour un cas sociaux, un fou, 
On compte plus tes méfaits, dans le parisien en effet 
Tu rêvais d'passer aux infos, dormir à l'hôtel avec une Nympho, sous C.C 
Soulager les soucis, ta vie en sursis 
Noyé dans la nuit à marcher avec des cafteurs 
À retirer les dessous des champs, sou champ' en after 
Tu voulais être à la tête du réseau, donner des ordres, 
La poudre pour résoudre tes problèmes kan C'est désordre 
T'a tellement bu, fumer k'té plu sobre, ski sort d'ta bouche n'est pas propre 
À respecter les mauvaises choses ton père est couvert de procs 
Voitures et bécanes de hautes gammes, tu tient plus en place, 
À l'école des voyous, ta sauté d'classe 
Parmis les rapaces, la classe a arboré des chaînes, des gourmettes en or, 
Ta payé l'addition, a marchander de la mort 
Avec de l'argent crade tu voulait nourrir ta famille, 
Mais tes parents pieux et honnêtes préféraient vivre la famine 
À rouler des mécaniques, ta escroquer des pointures, 
Sous commission rogatoire, ta fait une teinture 
Situation aléatoire, ta arrosé ton baveux pour t'en laver,
Entravé par l'passé ki ta fait baver tu le sais 
Il trouvait pas les mots pour l'expliquer, 
Suicide pour la relève qui t'suscite, o point d'repliker 
Tu t'en relève a peine, t'écope, d'une lourde peine, pour l'proc,
T'est qu'une ordure, ta benne judiciaire est pleine, mon pote 
Envie d't'évader, t'taillader les veines, 
Gaspiller tant d'années, dans une cellule par le système condamné 
C le jeu d'la rue mais t nul, ta encore perdu, t têtu,
Dommage pour que tu comprenne il fallait qu'on te tue

Tu veux jouer, les chauds, t'aura jamais le dernier mot,
Tu meurt en héros, mais la vie continue 
Derrière les barreaux, tu fait pleurer la mama,
Tu meurs en héros, mais la vie continue

Tu respectait plus rien, tu parlait mal gratuitement, 
En marchant avec toi, on risquait sa vie fortuitement 
Le systeme t'a électrocuté, te croyant le plus futé, trop buté,
On pressentait que tallé t'faire buter 
Ton décès fra l'bonheur d'certains, pas trop bon d'être crains 
S'faire des ennemis, on sait jamais d'ou sa viens 
Sur l'chemin d'la perdition T'est tombé sur plus fou k'toi 
Derrière toi 11.43 pointé vers toi 
Tu l'as pas vu débouler 
1 balle t'a traversé l'cou, Tu T'est écroulé, tu meurs pas sur l'coup 
Ton sang ne cesse de couler 
T'utilise ton dernier souffle pour t'relever, tu fais quelques pas, tu rechute, 
J'te sent éprouvé, tu lutte, tu vie ta dernière minute sous convulsions 
T'agonise avant l'extinction d'ton cœur 
Sous l'emprise de la frayeur, tu réalise en flash, re visionne tes péchés 
Sois repenti, tellement attaché a cette vie, t'essai d'taccrocher 
Empêcher ton âme d's'évacuer d'ton corps, avec 1 paquet d'remors, cayé, tes mort 
Ta ignoré l'dîn, tu n'été pas un sage,
Ta tout miser dans c'bas monde, alors ktu n'été que d'passage 
La drogue ta nourri, l'argent sale ta pourri, maintenant T'est seul,
Dan un linceul, et le Sheintan souri 
Après ton deuil, on prend les mêmes, on recommence, 
La vie continue, toujours la même chanson, donc, toujours la même danse. 

Tu veux jouer, les chauds, t'aura jamais le dernier mot,
Tu meurt en héros, mais la vie continue 
Derrière les barreaux, tu fait pleurer la mama,
Tu meurs en héros, mais la vie continue

Tu veux jouer, les chauds, t'aura jamais le dernier mot,
Tu meurt en héros, mais la vie continue 
Derrière les barreaux, tu fait pleurer la mama,
Tu meurs en héros, mais la vie continue",La Vie Continue
Rohff,"Je suis l'homme idéal pour celle qui m'accepteras comme je suis
Le passé construit les mères de demain,
Les hommes d'aujourd'hui pure produit du ghetto français,
Je regarde froidement ce qui me pâlit je le fait même pas exprès
Mon cœur sature mon cerveau désynchronise mes réactions je me mêlé les pinceau
Ainsi que les émotions j'ai retrouvé la notion du bien par les chemins du mal
J'essaye de combler ce qui manque à ma vie,
Les sylogie du mal mes qualités mes défauts me portent
Ceux qui s'aiment pour ce qu'ils sont se supportent,
Pas comme une folle qui met un fou à la porte
Issue des foyer brisé comme le cœur au visage giflé griffé pour soulagé tes rancœurs
Mes problèmes les incompatible s'acceptent pour les mômes
Comme la pauvreté et la promiscuité sans faire l'aumône
On promet de discuter mais on a trop la haine
Donc on s'insulte autant de fois qu'on s'est dit je t'aime
Les meufs de cité s’imprègne du caractère de leur frère,
Donc leur mari vont pleurer ds les bras de leur mères
C'est le bras de fer à la maison, on se pousse à bout,
L’indépendance à toujours raison et veut pisser debout

Accepte moi comme je suis, on a tous l'esprit contaminé dans cette société
L'humour et le charme séduit pour les plaies s'endurcissent
Sa ne dure plus y a de quoi s’inquiéter avec qui faire sa vie plus rien ne suffit,
C'est plein de vices et de dossier et les cœurs,
Y a pas de sentiment que des centimes et des centimètres

J'ai enregistré trop de chose par Louis et la vue,
Mon subconscient est plein à craqué la vie et la rue
M'a beaucoup aidé quoiqu'on en dise pour elle je viens plaidé
Elle ma nourrit eberger comme son fils à la fois
Ma hantise je l'ais ds la peau mon regard mon humour
T'es bien contente quand tu rigole du fonds de ton amour
M'en veut pas si j'ai besoin de sortir voire mes potes
Va voir ta copine si tu veux je te dépose t'accompagne à sa porte,
Les meufs rien que sa papote raconte lui comment je té rendu croque le premier jour de drague
Jusqu’à ce que je devienne ta drogue
Mon caractère est à prendre ou a laisser autrement dis ton cœur et a comprendre ou a blesser
Le syndrome du cœur d'acier, on parleras de s'embrasser si je valide ton dossier
Si je te vois que la nuit c que le jour est fait pour bosser
Et si tu m'aimes c avec mes dilemme mon taffe et mon passé

À cause du succès je ne sais plus à quoi me fier
Y a de plus en plus de matérialiste et je dois me méfier
Tes attiré par Rohff et pas Houssni
Tu connais mes singles pas qui je suis d'où je viens c grave mousseline
La dounia me joue des tour la tentations me tourne autour m’affaiblis et me détourne
Je sais ou je dois aller mais je sais plus trop où j'en suis
On accumule les pêches comme si il yen avé pas assez
Ma femme la musique, la solitude ma maîtresse
On prend de l'âge nos parents veulent nous marier mais rien ne presse
Le vice attise nos faiblesse les couple se font se défont on se goûte et on se laisse
Les couples ne durent plus , la société perverti la donne
Pas grave si t con ou conne tant que t beau ou bonne

Et que t'habite dans un pavillon même si t moche elle te trouve super millions
Je suis pas un sex symbol j'ai un plus beau zen que Tom Cruise
Cousine, raconter sa vie à une fille c charger un fusil
Je suis le mâle dominant des charmantes demoiselle
Qui font de toi un oiseau qui s'imagine pas sans ailes

Jais comme jais grandi j'aurai pu être pire accepte moi comme je suis
Je te ferai croqué mon empire ce que tu me donneras avec le temps je te le rendrais
Si tu veux partir pour une vie ordinaire je comprendrais
On est différent les filles c des fleurs les bijoux en or
Nous c dehors le charbon le hardcore
On fait pas exprès de t'impliquer ds les histoires de gardav de parloir
A toi de voir garde espoir personne n'est parfait regarde le monde
Je tournerais mes projecteurs sur toi quitte a rester ds l'ombre
Façonné par le ghetto et ses vices on a besoin dune meuf coule
Pas d'une actrice épargne moi tes caprices
Marqué à vie notre vie est assez révélatrices
Et tu le ressens quand tu caresses nos cicatrices",Accepte-Moi Comme Je Suis
Rohff,"La flute, pour tous ceux qui racontent de la flute
Rien que j'ai fait ci, j'ai ca, j'ai été là bas, j'ai assisté au rumeurs, jte jure !
Un, avec ferveur il croit ses salades
Deux, il ignore bien sur qu'il est malade
Trois, si personne t'avertit rien qu'il te balade
Quatre, il connaît tous les plans, toutes les parades
Cinq, soit disant il a des sous mais jamais sur lui
Six, gratte l'amitié du showbiz pour rentrer gratuit
Sept, il force la bise, envahissant il s'invite
Huit, c'est pire qu'une passoire y'a toujours des fuites
Neuf, il connaît plein de meufs mais finit la main dans l'slip
Dix, faux artiste, manager, producteur de clip
Onze, il s'fait tout ptit en zonze meme calibré y flippe
Douze, y s'fait passer pour ton couz, y connait ton equipe

Pour qu'j'dise ne pars pas t'as empesté ma gaufre de ton parfum
T'as niqué mon sapin, mes sappes, la sainte aussi large qu'un tapin fait pas shab ta pas faim ?
T'as grave la dalle, accepte ce sandwich
Ta fait des tofs a poil et tu fais la pudique
Plein de makup, tu t'prends pour une balle
Si t'etais un mec, tu t'prendrais une balle
Rien qu'tu parle dans le merco style tu m'kifferais meme en 205
Grosse matérialiste qui se contenterait d'une vie simple

Arrête toi c'est pas tes yeux c'est des lentilles
J't'ai cramé t'es d'oujda, arrete de tismé france antilles
Shab tu connais personne mais rien k'tu fais la bise hein
Tu suce trop bien pour etre une fille bien
Tu veux l'faire sans t'griller cendrillon
Jamais tombée en cloque avec un cimetiere d'embryons
Dans le secteur ta mise sur la touche ton posterieur
Mais rien qu'tu t'mange des buts quand tu joues a l'exterieur
Devant ta cop' tu fais la belle
Tu gere les potes mais rien qu'tu la harcele
Tu parle comme un player, un lover, ne decroche pas t'as peur
Tu pleure une derniere chance quand c'est game over
Arrete te-hon, t'as rien vu, t'as rien fais mytho
Ferme tes fesses c'est pas toi qui fait ton quartier chaud
Y vont dire des conneries tant que les micros seront ouverts
A cause d'la liberté d'expression qui leur permet d'le faire

A une embrouille du drame, bébé j'ai besoin de calme
Trop nerveux, imagine si je prenais de la came
On a commandé des armes aux gitans, une bécane
Paris ma pollué l'esprit, fatigué les cannes
Faut du béton vert pour les soirée Hip Hop de Paname
Je suis sur messagerie, pas de MSN, ni webcam
Je veux de vrais palmiers, nique la mer et la plage de Cannes

On me tirait dessus, je courais au ralenti
Pris dans un traquenard, peut-être un signe mais bon toujours content d'être vivant
De plus un rayon de soleil traverse le rideau suivi d'un petit vent
Comme le veut la nature, un petit tour aux chiottes
Bien sûr jet d'eau, main gauche t’inquiètes
Direction la salle de bain ""miroir miroir qui est le plus charmant des MC?""
Bah attends cousin
Un ptit shadow à la Bruce Lee, je prends ma douche en chantant
""Live And Die In LA""
J'monte sur la balance, j'me pèse, hamdullah je suis balèze
Mais le menton reste fragile pour les sacs d'os, les balèzes
J'arrive au salon, oh un petit déj !
Un petit mot, j'te dirai pas ce qu'il y a écrit, c'est trop beau
J'allume mon plasma, MTV, oh mais c'est mon clip !

Air max assorties pour une sortie officielle

J'allume la radio, oh mon son!
J'change de station, encore lui, les jaloux doivent bien rager aujourd’hui
J'enclenche le toit ouvrant prend les virages avec du style
A peine j'allume mon portable je reçois un coup de fil
Nas mais c'était qu'une embrouille, ça devait vider les douilles
Les mecs passent leur mère au téléphone avec la trouille

C'est tellement rare de passer une bonne journée

Tellement j'me sens bien, je salue des gens que je connais même pas
J'suis qu'un être humain dois-je le rappeler aux gens qui m'aiment pas?
Comme le soleil j'suis brillant, des fans m'ont reconnu
Accueillant, souriant, comme un vendeur envers ses clients
J'suis pas des ces vedettes tout pourries qui se la racontent
Même avec une diarrhée, je signe des autographes à tout le monde
Direction Bélep, en mode potos, terrasse, copines
Un beau jour pour se mettre en mode shopping
Footlock, nouvelles Air max, j'les enfile direct et je suis croc
J'oublie que j'suis Rohff, tu me le rappelles quand tu bloques
Je revois une meuf du collège, j'crois que je vais allumer la mèche
Avant elle était moche, chanmé comment elle est devenue fraîche
C'est le jour des retrouvailles, un pote en permission
Il me dit que je suis premier sur le hebs, mon son fait garder la pêche
Y'a pas plus beau que le sourire des malheureux
Le téléphone sonne, ""Papa"" le seul mot qui puisse me rendre heureux
Je rentre à Vitry (City!), un mec veut faire la course
Un coup de gaz met les warnings à la sortie
Un incendie dans ma ville?
Ah non c'est juste un barbac entre dangers publics en attendant la Bac
Loin des villas, piscines, des clips tass strings une bonne fin de journée,
Garé sur le parking
""Eh Mouss, Mustapha ! Wesh, met plus fort! met plus fort!

Un son pour déstresser, passer une bonne journée
Malgré les soucis qu'on ne peut contourner
Toute l'année stressé par les schmits qui ne cessent de tourner
C'est tellement rare de passer une bonne journée",Bonne Journée
Rohff,"Le cauchemar du rap français 

Le cauchemar du rap français
 
Le cauchemar du rap français, en direct du danger 
Cousin, le ton a changé 
Comme le tarot du 100g 
Au rap français je suis étranger 
Tu sens que j'ai pété les plombs 
Comme un mec qui s'énerve pour rien, qui te fume sur le champ 
Mon vaisseau se pose sur les champs 
Quelque chose de spatial 
Après moi, y a rien de spécial 
Après moi, même dans la machine à laver l'argent sale 
C'est le moment crucial j'ai égorgé le suspense 
Si tu me liquides je me disperse en millards de cents 
On a osé me proposer la coupe du mois avec des chaînes 
Tu m'a bien regardé je suis pas tatoué je porte pas de chaînes 
Interdit de s'hacheum demande a Kool Shen 
L'avenir est à moi j'ai la bombe nucléaire dans la voix 
La différence s'entend comme se voit 
Casse-toi de là t'aboies pour rien dire 
Je veux que tu m'écoutes pas que tu m'admires 
Nouvel album t'a mis play sur la gachette appuie man 
Le canon vers toi sur une shnek quand t'appuies man 
J'ralentis pas comme 1100 sous la pluie man 
C'est sur ton ego qu'ton avenir prend ses appuis man 
Je suis au rap ce que la mort est a la vie man 
Au MC ce que les remords sont à l'esprit man 
J'confonds beau temps et la pluie, le jour et la nuit
Les joies, les ennuis, les choix, les envies, ainsi j'vois les gens vivre 
Qu'est ce qui m'arrive?
Hamdoullah, j'suis pas anorexique 
Je contiens trop de rage, ça bloque ma cage thoracique 

Le cauchemar du rap français 

C'est pas Stigmata et leurs délirs avec le Christ 
J'ramène le son qui te fait convultionner comme l'exorciste 
Demande aux braqueurs aux grossistes 
Tous les jours c'est vendredi treize 
Ramène Jason, Freddy, Jack nous on les baise 
On attend pas Halloween pour découper la citrouille 
Le chargeur anti-pompes pour des embrouilles plus grosses que tes couilles 
T'as la trouille au feu rouge comme les bourges 
Verouilles tes portières 
Musique interdite par la sécurité routière 
Des hallucinations tu verras
En train de prendre la dame blanche 
Sur la bande d'arrêt d'urgence 
Mon son est réel, instinct de sérial killer 
MC reste tranquille 
Où je t'en, où je t'en colle une 
On se métamorphose sans la pleine lune 
Monte sur le toit et gueule ta rage comme un loup sur une colline 
On vit pour les tunes, l'être humain est parti en couilles 
Depuis la nuit des temps l'état nous fait du mal, on s'débrouille, on s'douille 
Et c'est ce que je chante depuis le début et ce jusqu'a ma fin 
Comme le HIV je progresse, on lâche rien quand on a faim 
J'rap trop bien, c'est tout ce que je sais faire 
Je suis plus fort qu'hier 
Mais j'reconnais j'rap moins bien que demain 
La fierté des nôtres toujours pas démodée 
Le code de l'honneur demande a la fnac toujours demandé 
Ils sont choqués, se demandent pourquoi je reviens aussi vite 
J'vous réponds j'vous la remets parce que j'ai craché trop vite (Rhoff, Rhoff)",Le Cauchemar du Rap Français
Rohff,"Bienvenue au club des métaphores
Bienvenue au club des métaphores

J'ai racolé la réussite en compagnie de mes ambitions 
Sachez qu'ici le mérite se mange des coups de pression 
La galère m'a balourdé des années, irrattrapables désormais 
Par mon talent l'échec s'est bien désarmé 
Mes regrets sont biens dans leur peau 
Mes erreurs en personne ont tarté mes défauts 
C'est le mektoub qui ma disculpé 
Le bled qu'a arraché le bitume pour me sculpter 
Ma scolarité s'est faite insultée 
Par le manque d'oseille ma concentration avait le ventre vide 
Désorienté par leurs conseils, dur de voler sans seilles 
L'engrenage a pris au dépourvu mon instinct 
La musique a séduit mon destin. 

Plus je rappe plus mon flow s'embellit, mon hardcore s'enlaidit 
Mais le drame a du charme 
Je suis la preuve qu'il y a du sentiment dans une arme 
Même l'amour est infâme 
La violence me va bien comme de la soie sur une femme 

Plus je rappe plus mon flow s'embellit, mon hardcore s'enlaidit 
Mais le drame a du charme 
Je suis la preuve qu'il y a du sentiment dans une arme 
Même l'amour est infâme 
La violence me va bien comme de la soie sur une femme

Plus impatient que l'urgence j'ai fait bouillir ma vengeance 
J'ai violé ma timidité, j'ai michetonné ma chance 
Mais la poisse ma pistée, la confiance t'envoie des revers liftés 
Ou amortis pour lober ta naïveté 
Ma plume est bonne pour la psychiatrie 
On a grandi sans affection c'est pour ça aime les peites gâteries 
Avant j'étais connu dans ma ville des services de police 
La peau dure,mes cicatrices s’effacent pas au polish 
Faut que je e refasse une peinture,la vie ma rayé 
Trop d'équipe d’arrière, y a de l'amour dans un barillet 
Que la jalousie crève! Ce n'est pas elle qui ma habillé 
Le passé tire sur mes rêves,mon présent ne s'est pas enrayé 
J'ai déraillé le train train, l'avenir est à nous 
Micro dans une main pendant que l'autre recoiffe ta carrière à genou 
Ce que je te chiquera à l'oreille c'est de la lumière 
Que les journalistes arrêtent leur manière 
Les risques nous on les prends par derrière 

Plus je rappe plus mon flow s'embellit, mon hardcore s'enlaidit 
Mais le drame a du charme 
Je suis la preuve qu'il y a du sentiment dans une arme 
Même l'amour est infâme 
La violence me va bien comme de la soie sur une femme 

Plus je rappe plus mon flow s'embellit, mon hardcore s'enlaidit 
Mais le drame a du charme 
Je suis la preuve qu'il y a du sentiment dans une arme 
Même l'amour est infâme 
La violence me va bien comme de la soie sur une femme

Bienvenue au club des métaphores 
MC' faudrait que tu rappes moins fort 
Bienvenue au club des métaphores 
Ton flow ne pète pas la forme 

A force de représenter mes lèvres ont noircies 
Rien que je me nique la santé à fumer des cartouches de MC' 
Ton rap c'est une baltringue qui porte un dentier 
C'est dingue comme une partouze générale dans le monde entier 
L'ange de gauche m'a pété le tympan 
Qui ma fait la courte échelle? Je leur aurait pété dessus en montant. 
Ma voix est faite pour l'or elle ne chante que de la merde 
Un deuxième double album parce que je suis un célibataire qui s'emmerde 
Comme mes poteau ballon comme Dalsim j'ai le bras long, 
Bicrave ta coke, rien a prouver, j'bicrave mes galions 
J'ai coupé les ponts avec les souvenirs 
J'allais déstringuerla zéremi sans voir les sous venir 
Ma douleur a le sourire,le bonheur en est fasciné 
DE son jardin elle m'a déraciné car mon pédigré n'est pas vacciné 
Mon innocence c'est mon fils qui la porte sur lui 
Mon uzi chuchote si je dois t’allumai devant son lit.",Le Club des Métaphores
Rohff,"Y'a pas que les têtes qu'on piétinent, y'a l'accelerateur 
Je fais mon p'tit rapport pendant que je passe les rapports 
Craignant une fouille des porcs armés sans avoir le port 
Je plane entre la parano, le succès et la mort 
Jamais au point mort, je suis grillé comme le feu rouge 
Le regard farouche, Vitry m'a marqué au fer rouge 
J'rôde dans ma ville, ma vie qui défile dans le pare-brise 
Mon écran, trop vrai pour en faire un film 
Qui suis-je? Un banlieusard parmi des millions 
Un p'tit blédard moderne qui approuve la loi du tallion 
Les golden boys nous les taillons 
A base de golden nous les ravitaillons 
Trop narcissique pour intégrer le bataillon 
Stricte est la street frère, comme ma parole et les peines de prison 
Partagé entre fils et darrone 
Gène d'être reconnu par ma commune dans le bus 
Le hardcore ressort du décor dans une voiture de luxe 

J'écris des textes depuis l'âge de treize piges 
Vivre de sa passion de nos jours c'est un prestige 
Je remercie infiniment mon public intime 
La télécharge c'est le recensement des pinces et des radines 
Dur de faire un disque platine 
Je patine avec une maison de disques qui veut que ses artistes tapinent 
Ne clippe pas les singles en faisant les mesquines 
Passe du rock au rap, je sais même pas si c'était pas des skins 
Sans ROHFF y'a rien d'hostile 
Dans leurs vieilles compiles 
Rappeuse si t'es docile 
J'pête dans leurs vieilles combines 
Fini de donner de la confiture aux cochons 
Chaque rime devrait se vendre dans un pochton 
Je crache pas dans la soupe mais dans la cuillère 
Leur catalogue c'est du gruyère 
Reprend ton souffle c'est que les préliminaires 
Mon son est le meilleur compagnon de la misère 
Si t'es dans l'obscurité dis mon nom ça te feras de la lumière 

Ma musique s'épanouit partout où les gens souffrent 
Prononce mon nom et t'as dit un truc de ouf ! 
Pour serrer des bonnes touffes à la pelle 
Genre tu me connais, devant elles tu m'appelles 
Ne m'interpelle pas dans un centre commercial 
Vlà les cris hystériques ! Ca fait zizir mais des fois ça me fatigue 
Je suis pas toujours d'humeur 
A me faire aborder par un délinquant bourré au Code de l'Honneur 
C'est la rage qui dégueule 
Mentalité de thug 
Nique l'Etat qui fait du bénef sur la misère du peuple 
Y'a que dans les clips que le ghetto roule en Lamborghini 
Le ghetto deale, braque pour des questions de survie 
Le même train de vie que le RER 
Mon son tourne plus que les joints 
J'ai plus de voix que le maire 
Une pensée pour la classe ouvrière 
Malgré l'abolition de l'esclavage 
Ils se tuent au tatouage 
Pendant que je me tue à passer le message",Dis Mon Nom

Si jamais ta meuf, donc toi t'as à taille
Ils marchent pas parce qu'ils ont pas d'flow
Pas d'voix, pas d'style, ils rapent droit en s'efforçant d'faire la rataille

Mais qui t'as appris, ca se passe aussi facile que dans les films
Là c'est pour de la vraie, la vengeance laisse pas infirme

En promenade, en cavale, tu pourras plus marcher tranquille
Que tu sois cagoulé ou (. ..) C'est moins risqué

Un cadavre remonte toujours a la surface
Au jugement dernier vos depouilles se retrouveront en face a face
Comme au premier jour de l'embrouille, que les regards se mitraillent
Autant de haine que de douilles, aux represailles
Tu veux creuser un trou dans ta conscience, faire du mal en faisant du mal
Comme un kamikaze ca n'a aucun sens

Tu veux fumer un mec pour le regard des gens
Pour un manque de respect au nom de la drogue et de l'argent
Fais les choses bien ou c'est minimum 10 piges
Avec un trou creuser dans la conscience tu piges
Tu veux fumer un mec pour le regard des gens

N'ecoutes pas le premier couplet c'est pour les tappettes
C'est la porte ouverte au manque de respect au racket

Prends ce 9 mm, et vises bien la tete
Mais qu'est ce tu reflechis, vas y direct 
Et surtout n'attends pas le temps, il te met un disquette
Il t'a rabaissé, quand t'es partis ils lui ont laiché la bite
Si tu veux pas y aller tout de suite, moi j'sais ou il habite
Ce fils de pute fais son buzz sur ton blaz
Il se fait de la pub, chaque fois qu'il va te voir il va remuer la pulpe
Calcules pas les consequences, mefies toi de leur conseils
Ce chien a prit la confiance, en plus il te doit de l'oseille
T'es pas le 1er, ni le dernier a tuer impunément
Y'en a pleins qu'on un cimetiere derriere avec qui on vit communément
Trouves une becane, un pilote, un alibi et mets les gants

L'arme blanche est une arme a d'ouble tranchant
Elle peut te sauver la vie
Ou te la gacher, souvent les 2 en meme temps
Une cavale ca coute plus chere qu'une fouffe
Ya des faux fafs
Au bled y a pas de flouze et les bledards vont te rendre ouf
Tu vas revenir car tous les chemins menent a ses reperes
Fais les choses bien et c'est pepere
J'pourrais te fournir les armes si t'as la rage
Si tu reagis pas la c'est toi qui manque de courage
Tu vois ta mere durant 15 piges dans les transports pour le parloir
Et celle de ton ennemi pleurer ton reflet dans le miroir
Les crapules sans scrupules voudront se lacher sur ton corps
Ou sur celui de ta famille, parce que la rue c'est hardcore
Ne te laisse pas prendre par les sentiments faut etre severe
De toute facon on goutera tous a l'enfer
Rassure toi de sa mort rendek l' a. D.n
Brules la becane, jettes ton brolik dans la seine

(Alain de l'Ombre)
J'ai été débrouillard tellement vite, j'ai pas trop eu le choix
On craint le pire dans le quartier, y'a plus de drames que de joies
À ce que j'vois la situation empire,
Je mène pas la même vie que certains dans l'empire des bourgeois
C'est pas la bonne voie à suivre, ça braue autant qu'tu respires
Faut qu'j'm'en sorte, c'est auprès des anciens de ma tess que j'm'inspire
Rien qu'les keufs me courent après car rien que je conspire
Ils me laissent pas investir, avec eux je crains toujours le pire
Jamais au même endroit, grillé au bas des tours
Je suis devenu paro, ce qui fait qu'y a très peu de gens qui m'entourent
Quand vient mon tour je compte que sur moi et pas sur eux
Tu peux être victime de trahisons car très peu de potes assurent
Je veux ma place dans un milieu plus sûr
Mais la poisse quand c'est pas les keufs c'est la censure
De nos jours tout est à revendre, même l'arme du crime
C'est 1 pour la famille et 2 pour la frime

Fais tes euros, mange ta langue, arrête, ramène les keufs
Dis-leur que c'est le tarot, tu grattes rien là-dessus, bluffe
Le vent tourne, les poux changent de peuples
La 16 bat les records de bouteilles dans les pubs
Trop petit pour finir à poil, merde c'est hardcore
Comme voler dans le sac de sa mère quand elle dort
Comme picrav la mort à son frère cadet
Et lui faire signe de se taire pendant qu'il se fait embarquer
On a beau se démarquer, les stups nous taclent au moment de marquer
Le parquet veut te faire marcher droit même si t'as les jambes arquées
La faim justifie les nombreuses condamnations
On a du cœur avec l'argent sale, on est prêt à faire une donation
Viré de l'école, de la maison, la misère?
Forcer la peur d'un hall pour dormir au chaud l'hiver
En attendant que la mère d'une tass aille au taf
Forçant l'affection tout en faisant la bise aux potos, c'est grave
L'essentiel est de savoir compter, être réglo, du gramme au kilo
Avoir du culot, faire comme ?, tout revendre en lot
Stopper les études, trouver un petit boulot
Pour la survie de la famille, tu redresses les cannes, la tête sous l'eau
Comme une femme on s'débat pour pas se faire violer par l'État
Jusqu'à faire dix ans de plus que notre âge
Et s'marrier à 16 piges dans un sale état
Ça soulève des gos cubes, des gros culs, génération McGyver?

Ce ki nous renforce c'est l'espoir et la faim
Déterminé c'est l'histoire qui revient
Jette pa l'éponge on continue de se battre

C'est sérieux j ai pas le temps de déjouer
Je calcule pas les grouppies comme mon fils calcule pas ses jouets
Tu veux test?fais la queue tiki ils sont orgueilleux pour reconnaitre
Que tiki
Qu'on rappe mieux qu'eux
N'essaie pa d'arréter la rohff évolution
Je baise tout j'ai pris mon élan depuis l'ovulation
Y'a du monde et du son derrière si tu nous vois a genoux
C'est qu'on fait la prière frère
Ils veulent ke je meurs dans leur humeur
Rien a foutre de ton bling bling je suis multi-milliardaire en honneur
Plus jamais ils nous remettront les chaines fiers d'être blacks
Même nos daronnes sont contact avec la mère a 2pac
Au dela des limites du ghetto par mon vice
La musike par mon disque,la vie par mon fils
Ton père encaisse et réagis
Comme corneille notre malheur on le blanchi

Rohff,"Tout le temps que j'ai perdu c'est l'avenir qui rembourse
Ici c'est housni montana, the rap is yours
Hardcore pure, comme ta chnouf
Comme tijuana, c'est la source
Jsuis monté sans personne, sans passer par la suce
Ils veulent signer des artistes a la recherche d'un nouveau Rohff
La rue et moi on ne fait qu'un, jsuis acteur et la voix off catastrophe
Aussi mysterieux que la main de Jamel
J'ai degomé la lune aller le dire a Amel
Que des sons criminels, le rap a creuver le meme jour que moi
Le rap il lui manque une dent, et il a des grosses joues comme moi
Pour une fois que la modestie se la raconte merde
Mc t'es ma doublette tu vas finir dans un contener
T'as repris mes numeros de serie, j'ai le chassis d'origine
Comme un balle partie, jsuis incorrigible, encore une cible
Encore ici, encore une giffle, se gicle de debrouille
D'embrouilles, de tissmé et de gros chiffres
J'ai le pouvoir de raviver l'espoir sans artifices
Jmarque l'histoire, tu parleras de moi a ton ptit fils
J'ai pas d'autres choix que d'etre bon, partir au charbon remplir le biberon

Je fais ce que j'ai a faire, j'ai pas eu besoin de chauffeur
Cousin le pouvoir, personne me l'a offert
Parler c'est tout ce qu'ils peuvent faire, la plupart des bluffeurs
Dis leur qu'il y a rien a faire, le rap mon affaire
Cousine le pouvoir, ya de l'argent a faire,
avec la grande classe pour être respecté des freres

J'ai la meme demarche que mon stylo, deambulant sur le cahier
Decris le bitume toute la merde que j'ai pue racaillé
Jrealise pas ce que jsuis devenu, j'men tappe d'etre connu
Jme donne en spectacle, en pleine avenue armé ou a main nue
Etre en vie c'est deja risqué, meme cagoulé demasqué
Suspecté comme une petite mosquée
Traqué d'un climat terpetuelle alerte, show bizness jt'emmerde
Trop d'artistes s'y perdent, font que de la merde
A trop vouloir se rapprocher du soleil on s'brule les ailes
J'rappe pour te plaire, mademoiselle, t'aura pas mon oseille
Juste le droit de te faire cartoucher apres t'etre douché
Une ptite balade nocturne sur cette instru que j'ai retouché
J'attire les chneks et les cheques, je sais que les mc's attendent mon echec
Des mecs que jconnais le souhaite en cachette, jles baise en brochette
Comme sur la pochette assis sur France
Ministre de la guerre obligé de dire mon nom pour que leur son ai de l'importance
Chante mon refrain mais de ta bouche ca n'a pas de sens
Pas question de travestire ma classe pour des avances
Si mon son prendrais forme humaine tu perdrais connaissance
De voir le visage de la haine, le corps de la violence

La classe, la classe, la classe, la classe
Quand tu dois rien a personne, tu dois rien a personne
La classe, la classe, la classe, la classe
Quand tu dois rien a personne, tu dois rien a personne

Le hardcore mon folcklore, la balle est dans mon camp ou dans ton corps
Re re remettre tout le monde d'accord, j'rappe comme un porc
Tellement demarqué que jme retrouve hors jeu
L'arbitre doit valider mes buts, tellement ils sont dangereux
Laisse les se sucer entre eux c'est des golmons
Ils vont se bouffer entre eux, pleins de cinema comme Gaumont
Leur gueule est grande, c'est les champions de la langue
De la propagande, ok on a compris c'est toi le plus underground
Tu sors d'alcatraz, t'as le vecu le plus sale
On a braqué des superettes, toi un centre commercial
Ya que toi qui sait te battre, qu'a les couilles de se servir d'un flingue
Qu'a une equipe et le reste c'est des baltringues, ouais
Jsuis un bonhomme, ils font semblant de ne pas le savoir
J'ai de quoi les recevoir 
Jpeux pas concevoir une defaite, jsuis en mode victoire
Laisse des balles perdues en guise de pourboire
Ils sont pas de taille, pas de faille, mon micro maille
Jtaffe plus que 8 mile
Jtouche du monde comme chevrotine, comme la nicotine, l'alcool, la cocaine
Un jeune boss, qui bosse a lheure ou tu baise
Dedicasse moi sur ses bzez, j'ai plus de flows que de tunes a l'aise
C'est pas tout le monde qui pesent pas tout le monde qui baisent
On peut pas tout avoir, t'as pas de pecs, mais t'as des trapezes
Tu te rabaisse pour la gloire quand ca marche plus t'es frustré
Comme quand t'as craché alors ca t'appaise de te faire lustré
Le pouvoir, t'as de l'emprise sur les gens
Tu peux le voir, si t'as de l'argent
Sur ton pouvoir ces gens deviennent exigeants
Faut prevoir, une fois servi gé-chan
Le pouvoir t'es du miel entouré d'abeilles
Le pouvoir ils veulent gratter tes rayons de soleil

Les violents les solides, fuck les mecs fragiles,
Sous le volant une groupille t'inquiètes j'suis agile,
Un brolik un gros bide bourré de mafé, tajin
Insolite mon espèce en voie de disparition,
Tsé les couilles ils s'y connaissent dès leurs apparitions,
La pitié désactivée par le beef motivé
Avec de l'acier et du ciment on peut cultiver,
L'amitié tape la fuite dès que ca commence a chiffrer,
Le vécu on le cavale pas en vue d'se faire archiver,
Y'a des daronnes qui coupent la came c'est archi-vrai,
On acclame nos frères muses c'est des anciens givrés,
Vendredi les ient-cli viennent la près d'chez moi
On leur dit d'apprendre la fatiha ne plus fumer n'importe quoi,
Dans leurs poussettes nos p'tits lèvent le doigt aux condés
Avec un p'tit sourire on fais zerma de les gronder

Le ski fait tellement pleurer la rage
Qu’on a déjà appelé les plombiers

Comment ?! Éviter d's’faire niquer par l’état
Y a pas d’débat, tous d’accord d’tout niquer sur le tas
Pas comme un hagoun
Bien incognito comme un chinois qui braque sans cagoule
Vacance de rêves c’est Cancun,

Nous on fait des castings pour les clips et les djihads en Palestine
Cousine, nous parle pas des autres

Sent ma rage de vivre
Je respire mon époque
Ma vie mon rap s'entrechoque
Qu'on m'aime, qu'on me déteste
Plus j'ai mal plus je progresse
Peu de tendresse
Le temps presse
Si je par ma musique elle reste!

Je parlais de vérité, ptet de la tienne
Clin d’œil au sourire
Des cœurs qui saignent, cherche plus les mots ils viennent d'eux même
Je viens qu'après ta douleur qui nous hantent
Tristesse et joie, en nous se fait tant
Dans le miroir je me vois, je sens ton âme me reçoit
Ici chez toi, ou dans la turvoi
Tous égaux avec ou sans égaux
P'tet pas le même kilométrage de méchant
On meurt pas exceaquo
S'ta pas la foi entre nous y'a quiproquo
Si le ghetto a des oreilles c'est pour kiffer mes propos
J'ai pris mon public entre 4 yeux en concert
Et pour vous tourner les pages
J'suis pas le genre de type conseille
Lorqu'il me concerne, mal aimé pour ça qu'on s'aime
On n'est jamais mieux servit que par soi même
Conscient que chaque jour que tu laisse
Est une chance, j'suis auteur victime à la fois
Pour l'ambulance, éduquer par l'absence de l'affection maternelle
Il s'agit de mendier l'amour, remboursé naturel
J'ai pleurer la mère en retrouvant le paternel

Les ennemis ont les parchoc

Char et heurtie, mon rap à mis la rue au cloc
On connaît Mezzie qui veut m'mettre à l'amende
Sa devient indexant tellement jleur rend fous
La jalousie tin'invente des ces conneries
Quand ça chatte, sa tchatch, sa pas du succès
J'en profite pas même quand ya de la chatte
Mon compte en banque est moins blindé
Que mon bloc-notes, pourtant j'ai assez d'euros
Pour être joyeux avec les menottes
Pour s'en faire des toc-shows, juste une converse
Sans cette partie j'reviens manger changer les couverts
J'rap à visage découvert, le Parisien m'a grillé
Mes des lunettes de soleil en concert
Sa va briller, plus que sa va crier
J'rap mieux que toi essaye pas dl'oublier
J'casse des murs, les putin part de l'immobilier
J'frappe toujours le premier, à quoi bon sert discuter
On t'aime pour ske t'a, on te deteste pour ske t'es
J'me suis fait tout seul, j'trainais pas tout seul
J'me fait la passe et marque tout seul
J'ai de leçon à reçevoir personne

Rohff,"J'suis né poussière et je repartirai poussière 
Et le Soleil se levera en même temps que la misère frère 
T'es parti, t'étais là devant moi à me parler de Yarabi 
Tu venais de te mettre à faire ta ière-pri 
Que Dieu te préserves des châtiments 
Après la vie c'est autrement 
Et la rue perd ses monuments 
Perd ses valeurs, perd ses principes 
Perd son respect de la discipline dans l'illicite 
Les peines s'alourdissent des assises aux cercueils 
Un article en page faits divers, une Hajja en deuil 
Les femmes de la famille autour pour la soutenir 
Du chagrin de son fils qu'elle a vu sortir 
Pour plus jamais revenir 
Parti trop tôt, sans dire au revoir à la famille, aux potos 
Une lumiere éteinte dans le ghetto 
En souvenir que des photos 
Encore plus triste en vidéo 
Les quartiers désunis se réunissent 
Pour saluer ta mémoire 
Enumérer tes qualités, raconter tes histoires 
Partagées avec toi 
J'm'etais pas rendu compte à quel point j'tenais à toi 
Et c'est toujours comme ca, ton visage et ta voix me hantent frère 
Ta personnalité me manque 
On était pas du même milieu 
T'étais plus vieux 
C'est peut être pour ça qu'on s'appréciait mieux 
T'étais prêt à tout pour moi 
Au point de cartonner en bécane en venant bouger pour moi 
En rap t'écoutait que moi 
J'ai pas vu ta mille-fa 
Que Dieu les protège, j'suis dégouté de moi 
Que Dieu me pardonne 
SoubhanAllah à quel point les épreuves peuvent affaiblir un homme 
C'est tout ce que j'regrette 
Mais sur le Coran de la Mecque 
Que j'étais là sans y être 
Mais c'est Dieu qui veut 
Parler de toi me fait rougir les yeux 
Toujours une doua pour ton âme, j'espère te revoir dans les cieux 
T'étais un grand Monsieur, respecté même par la police, courageux 
Beau gosse comme ton fils, malgré le train de vie, tu le ramenais faire du poney 
Se refusait pas d'aller tout lui donner 
Tu savais pas lire mais avec toi on apprenait 
Un mec fiable, juste un regard on se comprenait 
Toujours le sang froid, jamais froid aux yeux 
Habile aux têtes à queue, aux roues arrières, même à deux 
Du 9-4 au 9-2 
J'm'en bas les couilles qu'il était dangereux 
Marche avec toi à cause des embrouilles 
On insulte pas un mort qu'il soit bon ou mauvais 
Dans mon camp ou dans le tien qu'ils reposent en paix 
Là où ils sont ils pensent plus à la vie 
Et s'ils pouvaient revenir ce serait pour gagner leur place au Paradis 
On s'entre fume et c'est le système qui nous met à dos 
J'rends hommage aux nomes-bo comme Arafat ou ??? 
Que Dieu les préserve du feu de l'Enfer 
C'est pire que de sentir qu'on va mourir, qu'on peut rien faire 
Quand j'sentais qu't'allais mal et qu't'enchainais les joints 
J'improvisais un freestyle qui te recollait le moral 
J'ai perdu beaucoup de gens la plupart violemment 
Pour des histoires de manque de respect ou d'argent 
Ou d'accidents alcoolisés ou d'overdose 
La mort met tout le monde d'accord, fait oublier les causes 
Soit tu relativises, pètes les plombs ou te laisses aller 
J'pleure pas mais mon écriture est salée 
Tous ceux qui ont perdu leur frère, leur soeur, leur père, leur maman 
Leurs enfants sous les décombres des bombardements 
Loin de la vie de Paris tout se passe comme Dieu a dit 
Que doit être la souffrance? Mourir de maladie 

Tonton Ahmed, j't'ai vu sur le lit de mort 
Ca fait mal d'assister à l'agonie d'un homme en or 
Bienveillant, tu me parlais comme un ami 
Toujours là à réconcillier les membres de la famille 
Tu t'efforcais de nous inculquer les bons caractères 
Nous transmettre les vertues, les richesses de la misère 
Le daron exemplaire, tu parlais toujours calmement 
Malgré le vacarme de tes nombreux garnements 
J'l'ai jamais vu se plaindre 
Revenu de la Mecque avec la lumiere, il est parti sans l'eteindre 
Que Dieu facilite ma tante 
Chacun son tour et la Mort nous a tous mis sur liste d'attente 
D'office tous condamnés 
C'est douloureux de perdre 2 fils dans la meme année 
C'est pour la mère de Mamad, Bassirou Doucouré 
Salam à la famille de Lasna Touré 
Vrais bonhommes respect 
Depuis qu'ils sont plus là c'est plus pareil, reposez en paix 

Pour Saïd de Chevilly à Athis Mons même en prison t'avais besoin de mon ons 
Et j'aurais tant voulu que t'écoutes celui ci 
Tu nous as quitté derrière les barreaux en semi 
On croit pas au suicide, l'Imam qui t'as lavé 
Nous a dit que t'etais beau, le visage reposé 
Car t'étais bon, tu partageais ton coeur comme du pain 
??? j't'ai senti mieux que du parfum 
T'achetais mes CD par 20 
Pour les offrir dans la rue 
J'réalise toujours pas qu'ici bas j'te verrais plus (...j'te verrais plus...) 
Quand mon regard était gris, tu me ramenais du Soleil 
J'me souviens du Laser Quest et des vacances à Marseille 
Tu me disais t'inquiêtes Housni y a pleins de gens qui t'aiment 
Tu leur donne de la force par tes freestyles et tes thèmes 
Tu disais toujours hamdoulillah même quand tout allait mal 
C'est Saïd tout craché ça, tout était normal 
J'ai appris sa mort quand j'enregistrais cet album 
3 jours avant on parlait de se voir au téléphone 
Comme quoi la vie ne coute rien 
T'es jamais sur d'être là demain 
Tu veux rentrer, te réveiller et aller au rhadma 
Pour les générations sacrifiées, les corps rapatriés 
Les mères en deuil et les hommes qui vont prier 
Pour les chers qu'on voit plus 
Un jour viendra notre tour et la vie continue 

Du fond du coeur, en toute sincerité 
A bon entendeur, j'dédie ces vers aux gens conscients de la réalité 
J'te parle de celle qu'on a vecu, celle qu'on vit,
Celle qu'on vivra certainement si on survit 
A Mamadou, la Goutte d'Or, 18ème, frère, Allahirahmou 
A Kimbatou, Choisy, tu nous manques frère, Allahirahmou 
Zohair, Dialla Coulibaly de Reims, vous nous manquez les frères, Allahirahmou 
Karim Zerouali, à Madame Diakite, Allahirahma 
A tous les êtres chers qu'on a perdu 
La liste est longue 
Que ce soient de la famille, des amis, même des ennemis 
Parce que la Mort met tout le monde d'accord 
Tout ce qu'on possède, c'est de la location, même si c'est acheté 
Parce que on emporte rien avec soi 
Que Dieu vous protège, bien sur, si vous avez la foi 

Je vis chaque jour de ma vie comme si c'était le dernier 
Et quand mon fils me sourit c'est comme si c'était le premier 
J'remercie la zermi d'avoir fait de moi ce que je suis 
Avec tout ce que mon coeur aime et tout ce qui me réjouit 
Tout ce qui me donne envie, ce qui m'attache à la vie 
Tout ce qui fait garder la foi et supporter la survie 
Tu peux recompter les jours vécus, t'en es la somme 
J'suis là pour braver les épreuves et la mentalité de l'Homme 
Tantôt on est fort, tantôt on faiblit 
Tantôt on se souvient, tantôt on oublie 
Cousin, demain c'est aujourd'hui 
En attendant le jour J 
Ou tu me verras plus que sur un poster devant des bougies 
J'espère tu garderas des bons souvenirs de moi 
Si j't'ai fait du mal ou du tort excuse moi 
Sincèrement, j'suis là pour exister du mieux qu'j'peux 
J'travaille sur moi même pour résister les tentations du Feu 
Personne n'est parfait, tu le sais 
J'arretrais pas de te conseiller même si j'fais pas mieux, je le sais 
Le temps passe et j'peux pas le retenir 
Trop de coeur, trop de nerfs, et j'arrive pas a me contenir 
2 personnes me font souffir, mon fils et moi on sort d'elle 
J'suis pas heureux moi, bref c'est personnel 
C'est mon destin, j'l'accueille les bras ouverts 
Le monde m'a pourri la vue, pour ça que j'regarde de travers 
J'suis blazé de tout et j'kiffe peu de choses 
J'me passe d'une femme, la passion fane comme une rose 
Envie de tout plaquer comme Kayna Samet 
A découvert de hassanats, faites une doua pour que ça m'aide 
Je sais que Dieu a prévu un truc pour moi 
Et quand j'vais mourir 
Je sais que j'vais rien comprendre 
J'vais rien voir venir 
Peut être du canon d'un brolik ou d'un fusil 
Ou d'un shlass tenu par la haine de la jalousie 
Ca va trop loin 
Parle pas de pitié, de respect pour l'être humain 
Instinct de survie et honneur oblige 
Il s'agit de faire les choses bien ou c'est minimum 10 piges",Regretté

Mes principes sont propres a la rue, a mon éducation
J'brille demande jamais d'oseille dans mes invocation
Tout c'que j'touche devient platine j'dois admettre c'est grâce a Dieu t'es pas content
c'est a lui qu'il faut s'en remettre
Si j'calculait pas l'Islam j'vivrait sans remède
J'combat mes vices, mon ego et j'avance sans le RAID
J'me sens aussi seul dans mes chiotte qu'en leur présence sa serre la main au ennemis tu m'étonnes qu'il prennent la confiance
J'marche avec des gens qui m'apprécies au nom de Dieu
Ce qui sont la pour mon nom t'inquiet j'l'ait crame en moins de deux 
J'm'éloignes d'eux
C'que j'fais pour eux il le f'rait pa pour moi mec
J'ai trop jeté d'l'amour par les fenêtres
On peut r'coller les morceaux ça tiendra plus comme avant 
Chacun sa conscience, ses supporters et bon vent 
Mentale de bonhomme
C'est pire que d'baizer la femme d'son bi home
Le pardon ne change pas le naturel de l'homme

Relation de merde, rela, relation de merde
Avant c'était nous contre eux tous
Maintenant c'est nous contre nous devant eux tous
Relation de merde, rela, relation de merde
Pour une place, une tasse, une liasse c'est la trahison
Double face serre la main au chien qu'nous haïssons

Fais pas style t'es content d'me voir jaloux
T'es trahi par ton regard
Arrête de sourire faut pas s'voilé la face
J'te gêne ou quoi ?
Aller fait un effort regarde moi en face crève de jalousie
Moi j'veux pas d'ton amour, j'rigolerai pa d'ton humour
Ta peur d'mon tempérament
Demain si j'clamse vient pas présenter tes condoléances a ma mère
Mets pas les pieds chez moi
Parce que moi vivants t'es un gros bâtard un gros jaloux
Mais j'vais pas insulté ta mère 
J'ai besoin d'personne juste pour m'enterré c'est tout
Et pour sa j's'rait reconnaissant moi
C'est quoi ton problème ?
L'offichialité, les meufs, les gogos danseuses 
Aller prend les toutes et barre toi casse toi d'ici
Rien a foutre
Mais saches une chose
Dans l'rap ya personne qui m'arrête rien a faire la d'ssus c'est mort, c'est mort
T'es pa d'mon niveau t'es pile poil à la hauteur de ma euque 
Et reviens plus ici ya plus rien a gratter ici

On se prend pas la tête sur toi quand tu vaut rien 
Ennemi publique n°1 dans l'rap français 
Tellement je les ais mis loin, ils se sentent offenser 
J'crois bien les avoir touchés dans leur amour propre 
J'marque l'epoque 
Trop vrai, trop frais, trop hip-hop, trop street 
Trop stricte avec moi-même
Trop d'confiance en moi-même
Mon pire ennemie c'est moi-même
Ramène qui tu veux
Faut pas t'le faire pendant qu'on est chaud

J'm'en bas les douilles d'leurs biographies

C'est mes couilles dans l'échographie 
J'ai peur de mourir comme tout l'monde 
Habitué à être en vie 
On s'voit mal pourrir dans une tombe 
Bastoné dans les ondes 
Dépose des mecs qui sombrent à l'ombre 
Qu'enchaînent les séries d'pompes 
Sous mon hardcore, d'la bombe 
La rue tu la bluff pas 
Tester ils peuvent pas 
Qui j'suis, ils savent pas 
Tout seul, j'me sauve pas 
Ca change rien qu'tu me croîs pas, me crains pas 
Tout va bien, tant que tu voie pas, viens pas 
Tu m'cherche, j'vais t'trouver, t'écrouver (Yééé) 
J'arreterais quand j'aurais plus rien à me prouver (Houssni) 

Je gère la rue et je gère les ondes (aah) 
Je suis désolé d'vous mettre à l'amende (aah) 
Je suis tout seul mais je connais du monde (aah)
Le 9.4 en personne, c'est de la bombe (aahhh)
Ce phénomène fait péter les plombs (aahhh) 
Je suis désolé de vous faire de l'ombre (aah)
Tu m'as trahis, j'ai compter les bombes (aah)
Je suis haïs tellement je suis bon

Qui veut goûter la foudre? 
Qui veut en découdre?? 
Petite allumette te frotte pas à un parélude de poudre 
Rien à foutre que j'ai plus rien a perdre 
Essaye pas d'convaincre une mouche de s'passer d'une grosse merde 
On meurt comme on rap 
De manière hardcore mais honorable 
Tien justement, parle des mecs qu'on connaît aps 
Ils ont pas faits les 3/4 d'la moitié de c'que j'ai fait 
Mon gun dans ta bouche t'parle de choses que j'ai déjà fait 
La pression psychologique 
C'est pas à nous qu'on la fait 
Je suis déjà un homme mort
Depuis la naissance et j'ai rien fait
Je sais sur qui compter
Avec eux tu passe pas la se maine
T'as beau être grand,
Ton crâne peut finir sous mes s'melles

Ils voyent que l'Cayenne
Ils connaissent pas mes problèmes
Tout l'monde est jaloux
Même des mecs avec qui j'ai grandis
Surpris
Je me rend p'têtre pas compte de la place que j'ai pris 
Ils ont un complexe d'infériorité tellement qu'je pris 
J'ai pas b'soin d'eux, que d'Dieu donc je pris 
J'suis trop au d'ssus pour qu'ils m'aiment 
Qu'ils supportent ma compagnie 
Vaut mieux rapper tous seul que mal accompagner

J'suis naïf quand j'aime bien, j'en ai l'regret 
C'est un pour tous et tous pour les interêts 
Plus tu leur donne, plus tu leurs dois 
Ils s'content de rien 
Ca mange dans ta main et ça s'plaint 
Sois disant j'suis millionnaire, eux ils ont rien 
J'suis moins radin qu'leurs pères 
En retour j'attends rien 
Même pas qu'ils prennent mes patins 
Pourquoi ils m'aimaient bien les langues de putains 
Bons qu'à rapporter les bottins 
J'les ais mis bien avec mon R.A.P 
Mon coeur c'est pas la place du marché 
Prend pas mon estime pour un canapé 
La jalousie veut m'arracher la couronne 
J'suis sur l'trône entrain d'chier l'ASASEM de l'album

En froid avec ta daronne, 
T'as plus de daron, tu le vois qu'une fois par an 
Psychologiquement ça ne tourne pas rond 
T'es paro, financièrement, parait que t'as plus un rond. 
Physiquement t'as le boule qui chamboule ta vue 
T'as la bouille qui provoque des embrouilles t'as vu 
T'as le corps qui tue comme mon son 
Qui donne envie de lâcher la purée, appelle nous, commençons 
Cambré comme un RI, t'as la chute de rein 
Qui cause la chute sur le terrain 
Des mauvais garçons au cur de lion 
Qui deviennent tout mignon comme un flic face à la rébellion

Dans ton équipe qui est la moins chiante, la plus charismatique 
Qui kiffe comment je chante? 
T'es au courent de mon actualité 
On t'a soufflé quelques mots sur ma personnalité 
Aguicheuse de physio, de portiers 
Pour avoir accès au carré VIP 
Sur qui t'as parié? C'est le quinté

Sélectionneuse, voyageuses, gratteuses, 
Rabatteuses, starfuckeuses 
Tu veux faire parler de toi 
Oui tu t'es tapé tu le cris sous tout les toits 
Tu pisses plus du moet mais du cristal dans les lettestoi 
Même les caméras des champs en ont marre de toi 
Tu côtoies les équipes qui enchaînent les teiteilles 
Oui te repoudraient le nez c'est comme ça qu'il te payent 
Va y déhanche toi, casse, comme dans les castings 
En mode starfuckeuses, en mode tass string

Même en ayant procréé ils reposent sur le concrés devoilent les secrets
Separent les chemins et les scentres d'intérêts ne confons pas évoluer et changer
C'est dur de redresser le fer forgé c'est par devant que la rue prend son recule
La juge divise l'avenir par 22h de cellule fixer le soleil et la lune d'une fenêtre
C'est dur compter ses jours sur un mur que le temps fissure
C'est fou comme il peut faire viellir un bébé sous son poids on finit par ce courber

Les médisants font ma promo je fais gémir les sonos
Je fais bouger les têtes et les boules même pendant les tonneaux
Imposant comme le gouvernement
Révolutionne le Showbiz comme la coke a l’époque du 70's

Je suis au rap ce que te sont tes bras et tes jambes survivre sans tes gens
Paris c'est la roue Rohff c'est la jante
J'ai ma chambre en radio en-fourré call pause ils retournent au studio comme si ils
Allaient faire quelque chose
Donnes moi les clés de chez toi aie confiance en moi
Je dis que le rap c pas pour eux mais le rap c pour moi
La vérité est toute nue la rue est fertile
J'ai pas de longue a chouhni je manie la langue comme un reptile
Ils se demandent mais comment fait il
Sur moi ils se prennent la tête comme sil s’étaient pris un projectile
Je suis la reconversion des clichés de banlieue
Chez nous c plus honorant que d’être décoré en haut lieu

Comme Bush je suis bon qu'a ckck bombardé
Personne ne bouge depuis l’époque des ckck bombardiers
J'ai le tempérament sévère craint que j’accélère J'attire l’œil comme le SLR
Ils sont fous je rigole pas avec vous et ma bass fait
J'arrive 10 ans en avance rendez
C un film de boule ou un film d'action numéro 1 je leur vole la vedette par effraction
Ton son je le découpe brule dans un sac foupe L'odeur fait gerber nos tuteurs it's so
Good Lyrical coutz boob
Plus de face qu'un breaker
La rue m'attend tel qu'un chauffeur attend son braqueur

C'est la violence c'est direct la violence

Ta meme pa le temp de chahed chika r chika o-h 2 f dans la plac g des part a GDF tellement je gaz,
la punch line du siècle a chaque phrase c la rime qui fait débordé La phase!
Plus jrappe et je chling mé fans devienne dé shlag mé flo dé cailloux de crack
Je suis en concert a stalingrad,
Hé yo je déboîte dans lé tunnel sort a porte maillot de la colombe
Dans du pain de mie av un peu dmayo!
C'est la guerre, jmé en application l’écriture,
Sorti du 94 ya du k-sos dans la nature je bouge et pete en silence,
La violence fait des sevices aux balance elle attend pas l'hosto et te fini dans l'ambulance,
Du le soleil a la terre v'la la distance entre nous,
Chu trop loin iratrapable comme une balle qui s'élance

Il jouent pas mon sons dans leur mission spé, psk r-o-h-2f est trop sans réspéo

Je suis garé entre le milliardaire et le six seven
Vitre teintées gros son suspens comme dans le film 7
Les bonnes meufs chouff ma benz et les jaloux s'ouvrent les veines
Elles veulent l'apparence de la violence a notre level
J'connais les deurvi ils vont pas me fouiller
Ils se mettent de la graisse à traire tellement exposés à a se faire douiller
J'attire la clientèle des hall leurs soirées pourris,
Les banlieusards ont la braguette ouverte autour de paris.
J'passe au detecteur comme un glock,
Fait pas la star sakrane dans les club
Qui joue les chauds qui tient pus debout à 6o'clock
Fuck les blacks qui s'l'achent sur d'la house, vous me faites marrer.
Du MDMA dans ton verre, t'es à poil dans le marrais.
La violence ne danse pas, ne l'ambiance pas, elle a le regard froid,
Le rap sent mais comme son gun elle ne pense pas.
Mon cerveau a pas un mot à dire, mais moi j'ai peur de moi,
Je vais même me fuir avant de partir.
J'ai la tête et les couilles pleines,
Envie de me soulager des embrouilles qui traînent,
A cause du taff, des bras cassés qui me freinent.
La violence est dans les gênes, elle est héréditaire,
Si je te fume c'est l'arrière grand-père le commanditaire.

Ils jouent pas trop mon son dans leur émission spé parce que ROH2F c'est trop sans respect
Passe moi le micro que je leur mette une rafale dans leur mère
Les rimes perdu c'est pour t'es pute et t'es supporteurs!

La violence le 94
La violence c'est direct la violence
Pour les nerveux les nerveuses la violence la violence!

Réalité ou fiction, on est tous accro de la violence,
On prendra le temps de réfléchir dans la minute de silence.

Je m'en bat les douilles, ce que t'en pense seul dieu me jugera,
La pérpete me guette c'est pas mon fan qui la purgera. Pas le temps de zig zagué,
On est des mur si tu veux joué au zagué,
On repose pas sur nos acquis, toujours au aguets,
Type tu te faire engrener ta pris parti ta rien a gagner la chevrotine te le garanti,
Je m'en bat les couilles d'une version d'une mise a l'amende toute nasse,
Un penalty dans ta face que voulais tu kil fasse,
Un brelik e ment pas j'etin le feu de l'action,
Je reporte ma détention mon album sors sous caution, jusqu’à la mort,
Jusqu’à l’incarcération, pour celle qui kiffe le hardcore et les accélérations,
Banlieue sud voyant comme le commando Massoud,
La violence de dissous, te faire disparate a la soude

Qui veut rejouer Tony Montana !?
S'refaire dans l'biz, niquer l'état est un art
Regarde bien où tu mets tes panards
L'alcool, les drogues, les armes te laissent mort ou au placard
Qui veut rejour Tony Montana
À la prod c'est le diable, et plus Brian de Palma
Casse tes hanches, secoue le tarma
Pour les mecs qui ont l'manche, ne font jamais les canards
Arrête la coke Tony, tu perds les pédales
T'as fumé Manny et ne sens plus les rafales
Parti en tout schuss sur une montagne de came
Pour être seul contre tous faut du courage et des armes
Dégomme ça !! OK on remet ça ! enfoiré de Sosa !
Le chargeur rempli de principes, c'est pas des hommes ça !!
Avec ton or, ton diamant, J'laisse ça
Aux femmes, nous on brille violemment
Constate !! À gérer ou s'faire fumer, donc on s'tâte
T'as des thunes à mettre donc faut qu'on s'capte
J'suis apte, les principes tiennent le pouvoir
Lorsque tu possèdes tout c'qu'un homme peut avoir
Le matèriel, l'attaque du Boss
Quand t'as le manche tu oses
Tu causes, t'arroses
Tout le monde s'allie à ta cause
Les juges, les procs', ton banquier, ton avoc'
Tout s'paie en liquide, en bastos ou en drogue
Refrain
T'as l'argent t'as le pouvoir
T'as le pouvoir t'as les femmes
Même Stevie Wonder a pu l'voir
Gère, avance ton pion, aie l'sens des affaires
Les champions ont des thunes a plus savoir quoi en faire
On espère avoir c'problème
« Plus de sous, plus de soucis ! », plus tu souffres plus on t'aime
D'plus en plus speed, ils ont drogués l'époque
On incarne ce mode de vie Scarface dans notre froc
La loi la plus grosse tass', la France en état de choc

Tony, t'es un chlingue, tu dépends de ta camelote
En haute mer la navigation dépend de son pilote
Sur le périph' de l'illicite sors à la première porte
Le radar c'est le glock
Les poux changent de thugs comme ça croque
Pote dérouille ton flingues, y'a pas d'potes !!
T'es enceinte d'une balance !? Bah avorte !!
Refrain
Tu veux faire le mafieux
Tu t'verras pas vieux
Tu finis dans l'feu
Sous plusieurs coup d'feux
Ton équipe s'implante
Les plans sont juteux
L'angoisse te prend au ventre
L'amitié est douteuse
Le bonheur est coûteux
Comme ton orgueil
Tu peux t'évader d'taule
Mais pas d'un cercueil

Personne s'en mêle
Même les inspecteurs
Adieu Melle

Mais comment se fait-il que Rohff il rap comme ça
Ils veulent faire comme lui c'est pas des hommes ça
C'est comme ça
Regarde comment on fait négro c'est comme ça
Les starfuckeuses, comme la bite elles aiment ça
Et l'moindre bruit ça fait douiller maintenant c'est comme ça
J'ai réussi c'est la jalousie négro c'est comme ça
Mais pourquoi les gens souffrent comme ça
On vit, on survit et crève comme ça

Violent comme la street, gun chargé comme un spliff
La violence m'a élevé donc normal je la kiffe
Pas de temps pour les biffs faire du bruit comme game et fiff
Rappeur c'est une gifle, j'fais la diff', parle en chiffres
M'en veux pas si j'mets ""trésor"" sur la …
Prise même dans l'illicite un coup d'fil anonyme
Une grosse prise meurtrier pour la bizz
J'ai l'pouvoir et d'l'emprise un billet
Et ta cervelle éclabousse sur ton pare-brise
La réalité est telle qu'elle,
Le shit est la cham m'laissent des séquelles
Imagine si j'prenais d'la coc', j'ai arrêté la Heineken
J'essaie de faire les choses bien
En attendant la bombe, la bombe mon fils pousse bien
Il fait la taille d'un bomb
Je sais qu'si j'tombe
J'aurais pas b'soin de monde derrière
Si j'meurs, elles continueront à m'donner leur bonda
Une pûte n'avoue jamais que sans les tunes
Et qu'elle est là parce que tu sens les tunes
C'est pour ça qu'on t'fout l'feu
J'assume ma place parmi les terriens
Ferme ta gueule si t'es rien
Le flow reste aérien
Tellement faux tu dégages rien
J'lâche rien, baise-moi la main sale chien
Si j'me retiens, la directive j'la laisse aux p'tits frangins

Au refrain

Et c'est l'historique, sur un beat horrible
S'mange des gifles de gorille
Assieds-toi sur ton album cousin I'm sorry
Oh oui, j'prends du plaisir, t'es fou toi
Le désir comme un mec qui tire pour toi
…vois mes frères, miss
J'abuse, les …sous l'abri-bus
Tu fais un clip che-lou
Le CLS bras-bus
Bling bling string-frime
C'est pas le culte tueur
Comment veux-tu être écouté par les fritures
Crâmé dans la voiture
Sous filature les mecs et ton karma
Présent pour ton darma qu'ils font pas des kanas
Niquer l'état, état anal et plus gras
Devenu plus gras, paraît qu'c'est troqué d'gros
Sous l'soleil…
Instinct…au stade
Si tu veux jacter enlève ta puce de ton portable
Que veut dire une famille si qu'un seul membre est solitaire
Connaissent pas le seul leader, c'lui qui est en solitaire
La Nasa a perdu d'vue, compare pas aux trous du cul
Et l'show-biz ne l'a pas eu, comme la rue l'a pas vaincu

Au refrain

Fais pisser l'son, quitte au mille sur Paris
Le son est horrible, horrible
Mets ton argent dans la machine
À laver, fais-le pour ta famille
Les banlieues ont la braguette ouverte
Autour de Paris
La réponse, la vérité
Ton flow pue d'la gueule
Faut soigner ta carrie
J'prends du plaisir, oh oui, oh oui
Pour la haine que je règne, me craigne, gangrène
Pour qu'tu prennes leur parti, cousin j'ai pas ce problème
La mitraille était pleine, y'a des erreurs à n'pas faire
Laisse-moi faire j'ai l'peigne pour coiffer l'affaire
Tout l'monde veut trouver son plan
Tout l'monde cuet tremper son gland
Tout l'monde va pousser son clan
L'aspect sanglant
Et les groupies choisissent leur camp
Y'a pas d'double face
C'est qu'ta côte, qui fait qu'd'autres MC qu'elle aille niquer sa race
J'perds pas ma classe pour un boule
Franc du collier et m'approche pas
Si t'es une chienne qui bouffe à tous les rateliers
Elles savent toutes qui est l'boss
Tous contre Houssni
Crapuleux comme un arrachage de pauvres gosses
C'est la Hass, ta carrière, accroche tes pierres
Depuis qu'j'me suis placé un français
Scène de cul, la bouteille s'est cassée
… pointu
Ma bite n'a pas d'oeil mais elle a du flair
Tu pues du cul
Et c'est du gaz chaud, comme un kamikaze
Aux States j'vendrai des millions, fais la … en chambre à gaz
J't'écrase… j'n'avale pas le noyau
J't'assène en radio, lâche pas la selle au rodéo

Mais le jour de la paye
Toujours frais j'sens bon
Mon parfum c'est oseille
DJ play et mon son il surwin en bouteille
Incroyable mais vrai les MC en bébé game
M'arrivent toujours pas à la cheville encore moins à l'orteil
J'ai dû m'envoler blasé par le sommet
Veulent me violer bronzé sous mes rayons d'sommeil
Ils font les beaux, ils font les chaud stupide dans leur clip
Et n'ont pas le charme du ghetto dans la rue ça part plus vite click
Bem j'suis pas un boys band ni un gangster
Les jaloux font les dingues savent devant kill gangster
Demande aux zoulous d'être sincères
Tant qu'à faire demande a un libérable qui s'réinsère légendaire
Pour les gens dur, je suis tout c'que j'endure
En tant de guerre et porte un string camouflage
On s'la joue en dur. Oh frais?

Tu débordes d'esprit et t'en renverses sur mon coeur
Tu poses la voix où j'ai mal il me fait honneur
Ton son me donne des ailes, m'engraine dans mes ardeurs
Fais la diff' et je kiff de mes fresh à la hauteur
J'assume mes choix c'que je suis
Des fois j'sais plus où j'en suis
Ennemi, profité, l'oxygène c'est gratuit
Ils veulent me voir à terre
P't'être changer mon caractère
Vaillant et fier même dans l'impasse c'est qu'on est cuit
Préfèrent glisser leur peau sous les draps
Et nous on l'a risquée pour notre drapeau
La franchise nous perdra
Qu'ils arrêtent de s'branler
ça fait perdre la mémoire
Plus dur est le combat plus doux sera la victoire
Ils connaissent rien d'notre histoire

Elles me sentent profond, soutiennent mon hardcore

Un petit stylo bic, un petit bloc note
Écrire me détend quand je psychote
De gros soucis engendrés par des petites fautes
Ma vie, une mélodie jouée sur des fausses notes
J'extirpais mes petites mains des menottes
Tellement les chances de m'en sortir étaient si minces
Jour après jour le temps nous évincent
Il restera du grand Roi son portrait chez ses petits princes
La simplicité m'anime à plein temps
La quantité des moments ne vaut pa la qualité des petits instants
Touché par la richesse des petits gestes
Les sourires sincères des gens modestes
Les valeurs les embellit
Ceux qui se trouvent moches a son petit charme qui la rend plu jolie
Tu rougis
Sue mes petites flatteries 
C'est gentil
Ça fait du bien comme des petites gatteries

Loin du bruit
Pour tous ces faux gens qui brillent
(Que du bonheur)
Je suis fatigué de ce monde perverti
Souris-moi comme tous ces beaux gens qui brillent
(Que du bonheur)
La tech-nologie pour voir les choses simples de la vie.

Je viens d'une petite cité entourée de grandes
Un petit bled qu'on voit à peine sur la carte du monde
On peut nous effacer avec une bombe
Mais les mosquées affrontent
Une petite Sourate et c'est régler en 2 secondes
L'univers est plus petit que nos espoirs
Nos petits vieux s'agrippent à l'Histoire
A l'aide d'un appareil respiratoire
Ils ont misés sur leurs petites économies sur nos études
Les rendre fiers serait une preuve de gatitude
C'est tout un art de donner sans rien attendre en retour
Ne force pas la porte de la grande tour
J'ai pas les bonnes cartes mais je connais quelques ptits tours
J'éclaire tes allers et retours
?? perte de temps, un long détour
Les plus malheureux ne s'en font que pour eux
Les plus heureux se contentent de peu
Une ptite femme dans une petite maison
Un ptit bébé qui sent la petite commission
Tandis que d'autres traînent des garces dans des petites locations
Est-ce que le bonheur se trouvent dans les complications?

Loin du bruit
Pour tous ces faux gens qui brillent
(Que du bonheur)
Je suis fatigué de ce monde perverti
Souris-moi comme tous ces beaux gens qui brillent
(Que du bonheur)
La tech-nologie pour voir les choses simples de la vie.

Comment refuser le petit dej' au lit?
D'une beauté naturelle
Un petit calin je suis refait
Devant des dessins animés
Je prefere les petits diners
Entres amis, j'parle faut ?
C'est fou comme la lecture doit enrichir mes formules
Ou un petit courrier peut agrandir une cellule
Nul attention peut repeindre mon image
De trop meubler mon âge
J'ai assez de vices pour faire du bricolage.

Rohff,"Mira que te pasa?
sabes que yo estoy loca
pagame ahora, si ahora
La cuenta Senor Rohff, vamos
La cuenta est salée!
L'addition est salée!
Sur moi j'ai mon bang bang bang
Y'a pas que toi qui est dingue dingue dingue
Après la vie on paiera tous la Cuenta, la Cuenta
Tout le monde rougit, c'est la grosse giffle
Vite un verre de sky, un rail, un bout de shit
Numéro 1 c'est logique
Pour Mamadou, Rachid et François des quartiers chics
J'déchire les enceintes trop fat
Mon son suit un régime slim fast
J'dévaste tout, ma plume me flatte
Et je chante avec le coeur de l'asphalte
Mec, j'suis pas diplômé
J'ai trouvé la gloire en m'étant paumé
La somme des jours vécus additionnés
Je donne le ton pour les prochaines années
Ils peuvent me clôner, tu m'reconnais
Une liasse de gros biff, fais-moi de la monnaie
Mon son tourne plus que la BAC dans nos allées
Personne n'y échappe, la cuenta est salée

Everybody's got to pay La Cuenta La Cuenta Oooooooh
Gotta make it rain for La Cuenta
Everybody's got to pay La Cuenta La Cuenta Oooooooh

Deuxième couplet, le club est complet
D'emblée je laboure la scène et ramasse mon blé
Dans chaque ville y en a toujours une qui me plaît
Les jalouses veulent la doubler, empêcher de nous accoupler
C'est le game, un pour l'oseille, deux pour ken'
Dis le contraire et t'es un hafrit McCain
Clip à l'américaine, entouré de latines, métisses et marocaines
Ca cotise à 15 pour une bouteille
On laisse un fond de cristal pour ton birthday
Même si l'argent est sale, ça reste de l'oseille
On a fait la guerre, maintenant on fait la paye
C'est Hous qui régale, paye cash le restau
Pas de carte vitale, j'm'arrache de l'hosto
Lève ta CB même si elle est refusée
Et que ta meuf règle ton poulet braisé

Everybody's got to pay La Cuenta La Cuenta Oooooooh
Gotta make it rain for La Cuenta
Everybody's got to pay La Cuenta La Cuenta Oooooooh

Canta para los pagando la Cuenta, la Cuenta
Sur moi j'ai mon bang bang banga
Y a pas que toi qui est dingue dingue dingue
Après la vie on paiera tous la Cuenta, la Cuenta, la Cuenta
Dis mon nom v'là les bitches, regardez
A vos marques prêtes? Ecartez!
Tout le monde lève les mains même ta madre
C'est pas le boss du rap game mais le padre
A ma table plus d'un siècle de placard
Chez nous c'est up and down comme des nibards
Guette mon paplart, j'ai la grosse part
J'ai vendu plus qu'eux, à leurs yeux je suis une rockstar
J'veux voir mes smicards devenir des patrons
Transformer en jardin leur petit balcon
Reçu en grande pompe chez Louis Vuitton
J'en ai eu pour 5 fois le salaire d'un maton

Tchek le mic pour une démonstration
ROH2F est dans la version
Tu sais que personne ne peut tester mon son
Attesté par tous les mauvais garçons
Un autographe à la moindre apparition
J'fais trembler les portables et j'mets la pression
Entre jalousie et admiration
Sème la confusion
C'est la Rohff révolution
Reconnais le flow à la wanégaine
La mentale, elle découle à ma dégaine
Je pèse le poids de mes mots, je les engrènes
Toujours numéro Uno dans le Rap Game
Faut qu'ils comprennent
Qu'on à pas besoin de leurs morales, pour qui ils se prennent
Trop de gens triment, partagent le peu qu'ils prennent
Nique le système, de ceux qu'ils craignent

Laissent les chiens aboyer quand le SLR passe
Une sale ? font bouger de ma place
J'paie le temps, les aiguilles de ma Rolex se déplassent
Le ghetto fait péter plus de lumière qu'à Vegas
Efficace, j'concrétise
J'me fais des passes décisives
J'en ai marre de leurs pseudo crise
Ton Rap porte le foulard du showbiz
Ne jette pas ton doudou contre le mur
Relativise, chez nous c'est plus dur
Ton pit dormait dans un appart entouré de verdure
Ta clique ronflait dans les caves sans couvertures
Les épreuves ont les bravent depuis les coups de ceinture
Ce qui fait un brave c'est sa résistance à la torture
Tu manges du marbre pourquoi tu satures
On a bouffé des pierres, les dents pétés à l'usure
Arrête de jubiler sur tes vielles blessures
On va te suicider si toutes les deux minutes faut qu'on te rassure
C'est grave les tiens se plaignent de leurs fortunes
Les miens n'ont que la bédave pour décoller du bitume

Ils dorment trop donc ils finissent par baver
Ils veulent mes trophées sans jamais taffer
Font les beaux devant des go qu'on à déjà foufé
Chient dessus pour des négros qu'on à déjà baffé
Ceux qui nous détestent
Qu'ils viennent nous testent
Ou se taisent

Sortie de la tès, grosse caisse, grosses fesses
Fais péter la boite de vitesse
Ne te refuse rien si tu pèses

La France est à l'image de sa Citroen
Ses bals des pompiers et des fêtes foraines
Chasse et pêche, vin, saucisson
Jean Pierre Pernault et leurs émissions
Matignon et les valeurs de la République merdique
Comme les couleurs des clips à la Derrick
Panorama, Usain Bolt, Obama
T'es dans la ola
Des Galactiques aux Blaugranas
J'saute dans la foule, y a des requins et des piranhas
Comme a leurs public que des dauphins et des koalas

Sa fait un mois que je te pine, tu veux déjà te marier
La cuenta n'a pas fini de te faire raquer
Comme l'état n'a pas fini de te faire craquer
Trop d'insolence au parquet
Prend l'argent sans violence, on va pas braquer
Se fait pas draguer, qui va au taquet
M'en fout que t'es bourrer moi, je vais pas blaguer
On remet ça après ton rétablissement
Fait pas ton show dans notre établissement
Je sais que t'es pas méchant, respecte les gens
Y a rien à gratter ici, sois pas exigent

Doucement les strings, t'as encore un boule de gamine

Mais chaque bouteille à la mer
Trop tard pour son destinataire
Passer sa vie pour tout ressasser-sser-sser
Tout ça pour finir poussière
Parce que t'as rien pu faire
Allumez les hous, nan
Qui regarde de travers, nan

Apprend déjà à suivre le beat
Doucement l'alcool, doucement le shit
Tu deviens gogol, t'as toujours une chick
Reprend le footing, tu t'éssouffles vite
Sur un vélo sans selle, tu pédales dans le vide
Vie pas au dessus de tes moyens, ralentit la cadence
Mes bagages coûtent plus chères que tes vacances
J'essaie de faire doucement avec l'arrogance
Comment faire doucement avec la concurrence
Doucement le ghetto, tu n'en sortiras pas
Doucement les mythos, n'en rajoutes pas
N'abuse pas de mon estime, ni de ma compassion
Te tendre la main n'est pas une obligation
Prend pas la confiance, attention
Car tes larmes n'éteindront pas le feu de l'action
Oh, hey, faut faire doucement à part le son qui kill
Reste tranquille, reste tranquille, reste tranquille

On ne galoche pas les tasses, aucune passe devant les potos
On chevauche les collines, des louves classes et polies
Pas de nymphos sans nos lits, elles te prennent pour un trampoline
C'est les mecs les plus mortels, elles ne s'affichent pas dans les bordels

On les baise ne stresse pas à l'aise hotel spa

Qui peut me détroner n'est pas née je ne met que des retourné

Rohff,"Respect aux survivants, aux misérables bons vivants
Le coeur pur, ils vivent dur mais toujours souriants
Rien de surprenant ces gens ont gardé la foi
Pourquoi se suicider déjà qu'on ne vit qu'une fois
Tous venu au monde à poil sans mode d'emploi
Dépouillé ton étoile réussir est un exploit
Contente toi de ce que te donne le Créateur
L'argent ne fais le bonheur que des gratteurs
On ne peux pas tout avoir, n'en garde aucune rancur
Moi j'aime la vie avec un poignard dans le cur
Prend les épreuves dans les bras, soit pas ingrat
Y'a toujours un bien quand la vie te fais la hagra
Tu peux la trouver injuste envers ce qui n'ont rien
Moi j'vois des riches malheureux alors qu'ils ne manquent de rien
Mes problèmes sont les miens, pleure pour les tiens
Quoi qu'il arrive y'a pas plus grand malheur que le sien
J'veux plus d'oseille ne me demande pas combien ohhh
Ce qui me perd me fais du bien
Elle aime rohff hous la tire par les cheveux
Mes rêves ont la dalle je les nourri comme je peux 

J'roulais en twingo rêvais d'lambo
Quand j'mendors à fresnes et maman se réveille en sanglot (On ne peut pas tout avoir)
J'étais ti-peu j'rêvais de percer
Les keufs font la course quand le sheitan joue au tiercé (On ne peut pas tout avoir)
Maman était ma reine, j'ai prié pour qu'elle revienne
Quand papa me disait (On ne peut pas tout avoir)
OOh Oooh OOh (On ne peut pas tout avoir)

A moi l'argent et le boule de l'infirmière
J'te laisse le beurre et le boule de la fermière
Sur moi le mauvais il aveuglé par ma lumière
Ta beau ragé à moi demain a toi hier
Ta la grande gueule pour démarrer une embrouille
Un gros gun des balles mais dommage t'as pas d'couilles
Tu sais tenir le mic, mais t'as pas de vécu
Tu n'es pas respecté c'est chaud pour ta sécu
Miss, t'es love d'un beau gosse qui te fais cocu
Pourtant t'es belle, t'as des eins mais t'as pas d'cul
Elle, intelligente mais personne la calcule
Lui, semble intéressé par son appart et véhicule
Elle, une bombasse mais elle parle comme une clando
Lui, il est dégueulasse mais il roule en lambo
Son porte feuille le rend beau,
Ramasse que des bimbos,
Siliconée de partout sauf du cerveau.

Pourtant tes années taule , fascine les mômes
T'as pas de véritable amis, pourtant tu connais du monde
Ta bite est courte, mais ta ligne de vie est longue hunn
Tu roule en merco mais tu dors dedans
T'as la black carte mais elle ne passe pas, c'est chiant
Dans la forme t'es une re-sta
Genre Mickaël Vendetta
Au fond t'es qu'une arnaque, un vrai bouffon, une grosse mierda

Rohff,"J'ai l'art et la manière de m'en sortir sans C.V
Mon studio capte pas mais je sais que vous me recevez
Qui est l'exemple ? Hein! Si tu savais
Il est question de rap et de mort, un fan pourrait me sauver
Même baillonait, la vérité s'évadait de ma bouche
Dans le noir les yeux violets, je compte mon biff infra-rouges
Squatter le banc de touche n'est pas de mon ressort
J'essore, l'éponge du vécu par la sueur de mon sort, trop fort
Je suis pas né dans le confort, enfant des bidons-villes
Implanter tous ce décor où l'avenir est stérile
Rien à foutre de Sarko nous trouvent puérils
Quand les nécessités nous contraignent à faire des truques débiles
T'es pas dans la bonne voie mais dans le sens de l'humour
Famille nombreuse, on fait la queue pour gratter de l'amour
Chacun sa direction, livraient à nous même
On a beau l'insulter de chienne, la vie sans elle, on serait plus les mêmes

S'en sortir en banlieue, on peut le faire
Même si ce n'est pas le bon lieu, on va le faire
Inch Allah, on va tous se refaire
Ma sœur, mon frère, on va le faire, on va le faire
On a la foi, la richesse de la misère
Les yeux de la banlieue, on voit claire
On assume notre sort, on va tous se refaire
Ma sœur, mon frère, on est fort, on va le faire

Je vis mon temps en confondant les jours et les semaines
Nos chemins sont caillouteux mais on a pas tous les mêmes semelles
Les gens kiffent le sommeil pour s'abriter dans leur rêves
Pour moi, la mort est délivrance car dans l’au-delà, je serai plus célèbre
Le temps n'attend pas les remises en question
Vu que les réponses ne souffle pas les saisons
Pure produit des passions, décuplant les péchés
Compter depuis la création, qui est en mesure de me juger
Enfermer dans ma réalité en train de purger
Prend pour goût la liberté ne tient pas, pas le droit de se palucher
Crise d'identité à n'en plus savoir où se réfugier
Sexe, drogue, tristesse, stress deviennent notre Q.G
Les yeux partagés entre l'oseille, les femmes et je t'en prie de loucher
Addicte aux vertiges, vivant la nuit percher
Détruire sa vie est mieux que de se faire chier
Passer la bague au divorce demeure toujours un projet
Mariage, enfant les concernaient, les passes pour des privilégiés
Très peu se sente à leur place, le coeur léger
Chacun sa direction, livraient à nous même
On a beau l'insulter de chienne, la vie sans elle, on serait plus les mêmes

S'en sortir en banlieue, on peut le faire

Ma soeur, mon frère, on est fort, on va le faire

One love à ma famille et mon équipe
Que Dieu me guide et me laisse voir grandir mes petits
Venant d'Afique on reprend tout après on est quitte
Elles veulent l'amour en centimètres ou en liquide
Je me tue au sport, rap jusqu'au dernier souffle
Mon esprit souffre, donne de la force à ceux qui souffrent
On parle de dîn, quelques minutes après de tasses-pé
Tu sais comment on est, comment on fait quand tout le monde te respecte
Peace

On est pas du genre à s'appitoyer sur notre sort
Mais à suer dans la merde, c'est marche ou crève
Tu te demerdes, tu va le faire

Rohff,"Qui veut ma Peau?

Qui veut mon oseille, se chiera dessus comme à l'époque du landau
Qui veut ma peau, aura la sienne suspendu à un porte manteau
Cascadeur et solidaire tah Belmondo
Tu peux me jeter dans la seine, je reviendrai percé ton dos
Je compte plus les coups d'couteau dans le mien
Je me méfie de l'homme au point de finir maître chien
Tu veux m'faire ? fais le bien!
Qu'on sache pas d'où àa vient
De manière à assurer l'espérance de vie des tiens
Monte au ciel mon assassin par instinct de survie
C'est en glissant sur certaines bombes que la paix a fleurie
Et les hagals se demandent pourquoi autant de violence?
C'est les corbillards qui se foutent des ambulances
Je danse entre les balles qui ricochent
Qui veut manger ma gamelle, la chiera par une poche
L'orgueil me perdra un de ces quatre peut-être
Essaye de décrocher mes couilles, t'en aura quatre quand je vais te la mettre!

Qui veut ma Peau ?
Qui veut mon Oseille?

Isolé dans mon coin, dans une période noir
Kalash' en main, je me suis vu dans le miroir
Les histoires ne m'ont jamais dépassées
Chaque fois que je flirte avec la peur, je finis par la baiser
Je me retrouve à redressé
Une vie pas faite pour moi
Qui chasse le naturel, elle revient en glock derrière toi
Entre elle qui me fait croire, qu'elle a avortée
Et ces gens qu'ils veulent me voir, pour des embrouilles montées
Un appel anonyme destiné qu'à induire
Un journaliste à l'erreur, mais l'horreur a su m'accueillir
Pour vous dire, jusqu'où la jalousie irait pour me nuire
Réussir, dans le ghetto n'empêcherai pas de mal finir
Je rêve de paix
Ma propre chance a la poisse
Sous pression depuis que je fais du sale, à coucher dans l'angoisse
On m'envie trop, pour facilité la tâche
Que veux-tu que j'y fasse ? Que je me cache?
Je pars au clash, pour mon cash
Quitte à ce que je gâche tout!

Qui veut ma Peau?
Qui veut mon Oseille?

Cette après-midi là, mes voisins ont sursauté
Mon 3.5.7 a jacté, un pare-brise à sauté
Les menaces téléphonique, sont venue me parasité
Je ne compte pas sur ma lucidité
Je ne parle pas, j'ai pas hésité
À quelques millimètres de la perpétuité
J'avoue ne pas être le parfait muslim
Je ne suis pas dans un film de ? de cocaïne, everyday I'm Housni
Numéro 1 vaut plus de zéro, j'ai les crocs des blèmes-pro
De l'égo j'en ai trop, les impôts soit disant veulent me taxer des euros
Tu sais qu'on ne manque pas d'audace
Rien à perdre comme ce qui entasse
J'suis pas de ces cas qui se laisse pousser la barbe à la moindre menace
C'est pas du rap de baltringue
La vie nous a tous rendu dingue
Question bonheur, d'oseille qui pourrait m'allumer quand je pourrais t'éteindre!

Qui veut mon Oseille?

Je plante mon drapeau devant tout ske vous etes

Loin du rap francais j'exerce en otarcie 
Bien dans mes pompe magré les cailloux dans mes gucci

Un homage la vie une longue marche 
J'nage avec mes couilles en guise de boué d'sauvtage 
A contre courant j'ai pris le large 
J'oublie pas les frero d'lautre coté du rivage 
Ou dans mon sillage avec le 36 au retro 
On a plus la meme vie mais né en moin la meme mentale 
Le show bizz qui nous juge est peu fréquentable
Nous offre des magnum et leur femme s'invite a notre table

Ou que jaille le respect m'attend
Chanter flatter de voir autant de jeunes me représenté 
La vie d'artiste est si belle mais si triste 
On a pas d'médiatique bouzi les mères de mes fils

Ai le cur lège 
Les anges nous enveloppent, savoure ce privilège
Prend ce billet de 500 pour essuyer tes larmes
Ta robe tue, elle est aussi blanche que mon arme
Ton mari vient de la rue, le costard taillé par une lame
On l'appelait déjà monsieur, demoiselle devient une dame
T'es plus une gamine
Zappe les clubbeuses de copines
Orgueilleuse, bousillées à la nicotine
Fais-moi confiance, tiens mon code pin
Si tu me réveille pour prier derrière moi, je dirais Amin
Tu veux un enfant de moi, faut que t'en restes digne
Pour les jours où notre mariage aura une sale mine

Je marie tes rêves, miss, marie mes cauchemars
Impose la trêve que je puisse m'évader du corbillard
Avant que les corps remontent à la surface du brouillard
Que je me fasse une bande ou finisse au trou comme la poule noir
Les corbeaux survolent mon passé sans foi ni loi
J'enterre ma vie de garçon dans les profondeurs d'une fille de joie
Une rose rouge pour implorer le pardon si je déçois
Habille-toi de moi, je t'irais mieux que de la soie
Ne me demande pas de faire un choix entre ma mère et toi, yeah 
Ma place au paradis se trouve pas sous tes pieds
Je lâcherai pas ma famille
N'insulte pas mes amis
T'amuse pas à poser le doigt où ça fait mal à ma vie

Tire moi vers le haut, je te le rendrais me amor
Ai plus de valeur que l'or
Je t'aimerais jusqu'à la mort

Mariée à la street
Mariée à mes principes
Mariées à mes vices 
Mais pas mariées à un sal type
Soit on est hnin, soit on ne l'ai pas
Garde-moi seul confident entre les hauts et les bas
Quand on se dévoile, les vautours s'alimentent
Une alliance ne garanti pas l'entente
Ni la réponse aux attentes
Pas l'ombre d'un doute, si t'ensoleille mon existence
Sacrifie ton physique pour enfanter ma descendance
Accorde-moi cette danse
Sous notre pleine lune de miel
Deux étoiles dans le ciel
Dans mon cur noir, une étincelle
Tu veux un homme ouvert 
A la fois autoritaire
Qui te fais PTDR
Qui te rappelle ton père
Je t'ai déshabillé de son nom pour te vêtir du mien

Et là c'est du Rohff français

Trafiquant de classique
Monte le son, plus de micro
O.K

Je ne sais plus trop ce qui m'inspire
Entre lumière et noirceur, cette feuille je vais devoir la noircir
Ce texte, je vais devoir l'écrire
L'enregistrer, tout mixer aux States
Toujours un prétexte que pour mes rimes se délivrent
Les lettres, je vais les transformer en chiffres
Mon mal être, je vais le transformer en kiffe
Malgré les hauts, les bas, cette vie on va la vivre
Le destin nous met parfois en contradiction
Face aux actes de passion, je suis la pièce de mes convictions
Le chauffeur de mes ambitions
Autrement dit le panneau de ma direction
Des fois, je quitte mon chemin sur un carton
Mon terrain n'est pas fait pour se stabiliser donc je porte des crampons
Tiens bon, on m'approche parce que je sens bon
Je m'en prends qu'au gens mauvais, je mange pas de jambon

Classique, numéro 1 par principe
T'écoutes du Rohff, tu te sens invincible
Un classique d'être craint quand t'as la gâchette facile
Avoir un grain, qu'un bonheur n'est pas docile
Classique, 2 pour l'oseille et 1 pour les principes
Ici bas, personne est invincible
Je m'adapte et vois toujours plus loin
Je suis que l'ombre de mon instinct

A part l'oxygène, rien n'est gratuit
L'époque sous produit, c'est la baisse des Q.I, ça vie
En quête de plaisirs éphémères, t'es cuis
Tu calcules plus rien dès que t'as jouis
Repose sur tes acquis, moi je lâche rien comme Inzaghi
C'est le chant des tyroliens pour nous y a pas de téléski
On se conditionne, subit ou impose toi
T'es infatiguée comme Aldo Maccione, reposes toi
Ne rien foutre à fait de toi un cocu
Tu pleures pour un plan cul, moi j'ai le fisc au cul
Fiscalement mon avenir est paradisiaque
Plus je rappe, plus les ladys me trouvent aphrodisiaque
Dans les chutes de l'industrie, j'équilibre mon kayak
J'ai une collection de classiques comme Kadillak
T'es cardiaque, viens pas à mes concerts
Je veux pas de mort dans la conscience comme Malboro et ses cancers

Tu peux fouiller dans ma voie, tu trouveras que des vérités
Je suis mon instinct
Que des rappeurs, je peux pas aimer tout le monde, j'ai qu'un cœur

Je m'enferme pas quand tout est trop beau
J'ai détourner Juliette, elle a mal car je ne suis pas comme Roméo
Paranormal, parano
J'ai toujours mon parachute par peur de tomber de haut
Je peux rien cacher, je suis transparent
Les idées assortit à l'accoutrement des enterrement
J'imagine ma fin, je mangerai peut être un ravin
Ou des balles en plein vole gros, j'ai trop faim
Entre ma naissance et ma mort, je me sens bloquer
Hamdoullah moi, déséquilibrer qu'un droguer
Coupable de mes regrets, je préfère l'enfance
Car les mioches n'ont pas à prouver leur innocence

Classique, numéro 1 par principe
T'écoutes du Rohff, tu te sens invincible
Un classique d'être craint quand t'as la gâchette facile
Avoir un grain, qu'un bonheur n'est pas docile

Enterré dans mes écrits toujours vivant
Tend l'oreille et perçois mon crit
Douloureusement je rit
Tristement je brille
Car j'ai besoin d'me perdre quelque part où je revis
Comment fuire sa destinée
Dans le refus d's'y resigner
Assumer le coeur assasiné, mal aimé
Entre une famille décimé un fils
Que la rencoeur passionnelle met à distance
Pour faire payer Je ne t'ai pas oublié
Le temps n'est pas notre adversaire
Même quand ta mère décroche pas le jour de ton anniversaire
J'ai fais taire ma fièrté, te lègue ma dignité
Papa est passé par là quoi qu'on dise
Comme moi tu pardonneras

Tu pardonneras,
Tu pardonneras l'orgeil les coup bas
Tu pardonneras la jalousie pres de toi
Le temp saura faire le premier pas
Le coeur serré tu pardonneras
Tu pardonneras l'amour loin de toi
Tu pardonneras même si tu n'oublis pas
Plus amer sont les larmes qui ne coulent pas
Le coeur serré tu pardonneras

J'ai pas toujours été un modèle exemplaire
La vie était dure avec moi comme je l'ai été envers mes petits frères
Mon cadet me la fait payé cher,
M'expédiant derrière, les barreaux de fer,
Avec le sourir fièr
J'était maladroit pourtant je voulais bien faire
Pour me rattraper mais la roue à tourner à l'envers
Une triste affaire, que la juge n'a pas voulu guérir
Après ces années rancunières, frère, je suis prêt à t'accueillir
Faut plus que la peur te freine
Le temps à blaser ma haine
Depuis ces promenades pluvieuses à caillasser les rotfreine
On garde le même sang mieux qu'un secret
Dans nos veines sacrées j'ai prié pour nous
Sans que tu m'ai vu dans la même mosquée
Je te pardonne mon frère

Tu pardonneras,
Tu pardonneras l'orgeil les coup bas
Tu pardonneras la jalousie pres de toi
Le temp saura faire le premier pas
Le coeur serré tu pardonneras
Tu pardonneras l'amour loin de toi
Tu pardonneras même si tu n'oublis pas
Plus amer sont les larmes qui ne coulent pas
Le coeur serré tu pardonneras

Stop les repproches sommes nous pas des proches
Il est tant d'ravaler c'qu'on a en travers d'la gorge
Faut que les égoïstes
Ouvrent leurs portes pour que Dieu leur accorde
Miséricorde
La douleur m'éscorte ma colère s'emporte
Absence de père, j'réalise combien ma mère est forte
Trois enfants à 20ans sans le temps de grandir
Renvoyée d'l'école
Orienté par la rue j'l'ais fait souffrir
Et le pire, c'est qu'on l'étouffe chacun de son côté
Quand elle perd son souffle j'ai un point de côté
On a le regard noir profonde est notre histoire
La seule à m'enlacer dans ses bras au parloir
J' veux savourer la gloire
Bling bling villa piscine
Ma vie n'aura jamais le goût de sa cuisine
Dur pour une femme
D'élever des hommes
Le paradis est sous ses pieds
Q'elle nous pardonne

Rohff,"Le son des treu-meu
Y a eu un meurtre hier
La Crim' tourne dans ma rue parce que le meurtrier y erre.

On fait couler le sang car y a trop d'oseille en jeu
Le terrain est fructueux, mais les ennemis sont nombreux
Négro, cela nous rend nerveux (Ouais, cela nous rend nerveux)
Coupons la tête du serpent pour qu'il n'agite plus sa queue
Y a plus de grands, plus de ti-peu, on a tous une arme à feu
Et cela nous rend nerveux (Ouais, cela nous rend nerveux)
Viens pas nous casser les burnes si tu tiens à ta vie
Quand les crapules partent en vrille, nul part t'es à l'abris
Ainsi va la Rue, tu t'fais gonfler au parlu'
En cellule t'es pas en sécu, ta mort fera zizir aux lardus
9.4 Cac 40., tu carottes, on t'arrose, on t'arrange
Chirurgie faciale gratos, explose les phalanges
Mon équipe a le bras long, qui t'allonge sur l'pavé
Rafale en pleine tête, méconnaissable, quand on va t'laver

Pour un Oui, pour un Non
Pour un territoire on t'fume à la kalash
Plus de p'tits, plus de grands
Plus de respect, que des fils de lâches
Qué embrouille?
Y a embrouille
Pas d'embrouille.
Y a embrouille

Résidence secondaire au ballon
On peut t'faire en commanditant l'exécution du salon
Ils veulent tous avoir le bras long, percer, prendre du gallon
Une balle dans la pastèque t'apprendra à prendre le melon
Trahison, amitiés factices
Terrain à tenir, embrouilles faut qu't'agisses
Les réseaux s'élargissent, les balles sifflent, les pneus crissent
Retire-toi avant que l'aube triste ne surgisse
De quoi s'faire du soucis
Grimper les échelons, le chemin est long mais ma kalash le raccourcit
Tiens ta langue quand tu manges du sursis
Les poucaves se mélangent aux voyous dans la coursive
Affaires de treu-meu, les juges ne sont pas miséricordieux
Mais victorieux sont nos baveux
On ne sait qu'exprimer la violence qui règne à coups de feu
Que peuvent-ils faire, n'ont que leurs yeux pour rer-pleu

Pour un Oui, pour un Non
Pour un territoire on t'fume à la kalash
Plus de p'tits, plus de grands
Plus de respect, que des fils de lâches
Qué embrouille?
Y a embrouille
Pas d'embrouille.
Y a embrouille

On ne fait qu'exprimer la violence de ces jeunes oubliés
À nos regrettés, une mesure de silence, reposez en paix.

Les meilleurs partent les premiers, attendent toujours qu'on les venge
La Rue n'a plus de code, tout le monde sniffe la ligne blanche
Ta mort les arrange, ton terrain est rentable
Ce qui mangent s'en lavent les mains avant de passer à table
Les petits grandissent à la vitesse des balles
Prenant du grade, brûlant les étapes, ouvrant le feu dans les rades
Transformant en passoire ta voiture
Balle perdue, tu meurs d'un accident malgré la ceinture
Il commence à flotter du sang, sortez les parapluies
On sait où tu dors, où tu baises, t'es cuit !
Tu t'caches à la mosquée, même si te prend l'envie de casquer
La détermination n'a pas de prix
L'orgueil les rend sourd, y a pas d'heure, y a pas d'jour
Au point de te faire pendre au Ramadan, avant le f'tour
Et assister à ton enterrement
Écartant les soupçons, consolant ta maman
Les nouvelles générations raffolent de toutes ces histoires
Une rafale te soulagera de ce monde de hagar
On enterre les mauvaises graines, sans peser le pour et le contre
La Paix refleurira quand on pissera sur leur tombe

Pour un Oui, pour un Non
Pour un territoire on t'fume à la kalash
Plus de p'tits, plus de grands
Plus de respect, que des fils de lâches
Qué embrouille?
Y a embrouille
Pas d'embrouille

Territoire marqué, du collège à la calèche
Frotté au béton, j'en ai encore la peau rêche

Arrivé au summum, j'essaie de devenir un meilleur homme

Sur moi les yeux rivés, ma toile est tissée
Ce qui est fait est fait, du bien du mal, je suis métissé
Si c'était à refaire, j'aurais récidivé
J'espère mourir propre, cette vie m'aura bien lessivé
À qui dois-je plaire, si ce n'est au Tout-Puissant?
Rien à foutre du dicton, au bonheur, je préfère le bifton
Rouges sont mes cartons, je veux pas quitter le ter-ter
Comme un évadé de prison, je reviens toujours vers mes repères
J'ai émergé sur l'Île-de-France, l'île de la tentation
Vendredi à vendredi, j'y vis comme Robinson
J'ai kidnappé la gloire, j'ai mangé la rançon
Dangereuse star, le plus bouillant de la constellation
Mon grain de beauté, l’œil du cyclope
Neuf orteils dans la mosquée, le dixième dans un strip-club

Tu veux qu'on te signe, tu veux un featuring?
Oh damn baby, t'as pas de boule

J'ai la mentale, comportement exemplaire
Si tu me vois entourés de femmes, dis-toi j'ai grandi sans père
J'ai besoin de sonne-per, je connais tout Paris
Ceux qui m'aiment ont du mal à me suivre, je roule en Ferrari
Je gère le rap comme Bachir gère la Syrie
Si je calculais les rageux, je serais un tueur en série
Laisse-les me juger, j'emmerde le monde entier
Je mâcherai pas mes mots même vieux sans mon dentier
Je suis pas parfait, si cela peut vous conforter
Vous m’empêcherez pas de vivre, du fait qu'on m'ait pas avorté
Complexe d'infériorité, je te blesse sur place
Je te renvoie ta médiocrité en pleine face
La grande classe quoi qu'il arrive
À défaut de les vider de leur sang, je les vide de leur salive

Misère et meurtres, sueurs froides et frissons
Génération Sacrifiée dans mon chant de vision
Visionnaire j'vois l'avenir du ter-ter en Visio
Plus qu'un disque de platine, mieux qu'une révélation
Si j'les baise sur leur son, j'le fait pour la sensation
Que la langue de Molière lèche une bite en érection
Même une bête sanguinaire, on éprouve de l'émotion
L'expression des mauvais garçons, volcanique éruption
Tu veux siroter notre sang chaud mets y des glaçons
Comme mon flingue dans ton sous-sol ma musique raisonne
C'est ma femme j'la traite plus comme O.J. qu'Homer Simpson
J'laisse des traces de son partout sur mon passage
J'fais du sale, mon sort à la barre rejoint l'Sage
Il parle à tout les âges, cinq à soixante-dix-sept
Pour lui taper le dix-huit, pour moi taper le dix-sept

J'veux donner de la force à toutes ces générations
Mon son les a vu grandir déchaînant les passions
Je chante avec mes tripes, mes folies, ma réflexion
Y'a pas un classique qu'j'n'ai pas fait sans la pression
Les vérités de mon son, (mon son), mon son
La qualité de mon son, (mon son), mon son (mon son)

Retour vers le passé, le Futur m'a lassé
Mon son trace en Féfé', le tien le regarde passer
Mon son rime avec échec scolaire, vitesse, cul, excès
K-sos For Life, flow quinquagénaire, n'ont pas fini de XXX
Mon son crève l'abcès, entre la rue et la Justice
Il fait pisser le pus de la-de la police
Mon son donne du courage, pour charbonner, braver les coups durs
Réchauffe comme une nuit d'six en GAV pour coups et blessures
Mes écrits des cicatrices chéloïde
Déchire les points d'suture, l'visage de mes frères tués dans mes polaroids
Nuit blanche dans les regards vides
Embaume les caisses comme la Weed
Le rap français a la bouche pleine mes couilles sont vides
Ils ont tous bu mes flows, maintenant il se prennent tous pour des druides
Narcissique à la plume cupide, stupide, mon son te guide
C'est le son des générations soixante quinze, soixante dix-sept
Pour lui taper le dix-huit, pour moi taper le dix-sept

J'veux donner de la force à toutes ces générations
Mon son les a vu grandir déchaînant les passions
Je chante avec mes tripes, mes folies, ma réflexion

Les vérités de mon son, (mon son), mon son
La qualité de mon son, (mon son), mon son (mon son)

Chirurgien du son, scalpel sur feuille blanche
J'dissèque la nature humaine tel un cours de science
J'sais que j'vendrais plus quand j'serai entre quatre planches
Ils pensaient que j'avais coulé, ma kalash' est étanche
Mon son les dérange, coupable d'autant de tueries
J'vais griller la relève comme un curé dans une nurserie
Souviens-toi premier album freestyle #dinguerie
Transporte les banlieusards depuis à l'ancienne tah les XXX
Vitry phénomène, dictateur de la bande FM
Mon son a grandi, les cellules et les promenades de Fresnes
J'bosse plus que ce sale nègre de Guerlain
C'est l'chant du coton qui t'étrangle avec ses chaînes
J'suis l'game, j'attise l'amour et la haine
Commme P-Square, again and again and again
J'baise leur son quand je veux tel un plan de cinq à sept

Parler de sous, en France, est un sujet tabou
D'où je viens on aime l'argent facile comme les marabouts

On toucherait la COTOREP en jouant les estropiés
Le monde est la pomme qu'il me tarde de croquer
Pensée aux pauvres venus gaspiller votre thune à vous droguer
Un, pour la santé. Deux, représenter
C'qui est rare et chère mais le prix que j'commence à chanter
""Time is money"" écrit sur ma Chopard
J'dors dans le luxe, avec un cœur de clochard
'Paraît que la misère est moins frileuse au soleil

De quoi la France a peur? Y'a plus de place au placard
L'insécurité progresse, nous on régresse pas comme Kaká
J'embrasse la daronne, foulard blanc revenant de Mecca
Pourquoi ta mécréante de maman la regarde hagar?
J'approuve pas la violence de mes racailles sur ton fils
Qui prépare sa vengeance de la primaire à l'école de police
One Blood, j'défends ma couleur comme un Crips
Prends-moi pour une banane, marches-moi sur ma peau, et tu glisses
One Love, je forcerais personne à m'aimer
Tu sais pourquoi ta fille préfère les blacks, clairs ou cramés
Armés, opprimés, affamés sont les nôtres
Câlinés, pouponnés, et camés son les vôtres
À qui la faute si le racisme persiste?
Comme si Obama perdait son temps à être métisse

Pourquoi te sens-tu supérieur?
Qu'as-tu de plus qu'un être humain?
Différent, différent, différent
On rit, on pleure, rien de si différent
La vie m'en a fait baver d'toutes les douleurs
Métissé par le mal et le bien
Différent, différent, différent
On vit, on meurt, rien de si différent

Ma couleur n'est pas ma religion négro
Noircit pas l'tableau, non tu n'es pas un 100% négro
Ne tourne pas le dos à cette partie qui t'complète négro
Tu t'blanchis la peau, Bounty, tu n'assumes pas d'être négro
Me prends pas pour un rebeu quand j'emplois des mots rebeus
C'est dans nos Madrasas qu'on apprend à lire et à écrire rebeu
Aucune différence culturelle rebeu
Est-il hram d'être le beau-frère d'un khel rebeu?
B-b-b-basané ébène, babtou avec une galsen
Ceux qui nous prennent pour des singes sont en guerre avec l'hygiène
One Blood, brisons les tabous et l'écoute
Personne peut nous écraser même quand on prie sur la route

Pourquoi te sens-tu supérieur?
Qu'as-tu de plus qu'un être humain?
Différent, différent, différent
On rit, on pleure, rien de si différent
La vie m'en a fait baver d'toutes les douleurs

Entre les lignes, t'as bien lu, tu m'aimes pas? Moi non plus
Liberté, égalité, mon cul, j'roules pour l'humanité, y'a pas de peuple élu

Entre les lignes, t'as bien lu, tu m'aimes pas? Moi non plus
Liberté, égalité, mon cul, j'roules pour l'humanité, y'a pas de peuple élu

Raciste, fais pas ton hypocrite, ton parano
Bourré, t'es là, tu parles mal comme Galliano
Comoriano a la muerte, ne venez pas nous emmerder
Même si on mourait d'faim, rien ne pourrait acheter notre fierté
J'suis con comme la Lune, j'me prend pour 4 stars
À l'image de mon drapeau, mahorais, renie pas ton histoire
L'univers est plus p'tit que nos espoirs
J'fais la différence, d'où je viens, c'est un exploit
J'veux partir en yacht, rejoindre mes patriotes
Noyé sous les tempêtes au large de Mayotte
N'alerte-lerte pas les gardes de côte-côte Moinama
Ne sois pas aigri, ne devient pas gris comme Rama
Riez, la différence n'est pas quand on va briller
Ne me souhaitez pas l'enfer, sur Terre, j'suis déjà grillé
Fuck Montesquieu, il n'avait rien d'une lumière
Il ne voyait aucune âme en l'homme noir aimé césaire

Rohff,"Entre la vie mondaine et le Dîn, profond est le coma
Ma plume, sous morphine, Dounia
Tantôt on faiblit, tantôt on s'souvient, tantôt on oublie
Tantôt on est forts, tantôt on faiblit, tantôt on s'souvient

Tantôt on est fort, tantôt on faiblit
Tantôt on s'souvient, tantôt on oublie
Le temps nous veillit, profite d'aujourd'hui
Demain c'est pas loin, ici il est presque minuit
Immigré, francisé est mon état d'esprit
La double culture m'a eu, je sais à moitié qui je suis
Mon cœur noircit, les épreuves m'ont trop endurci
Je dors le jour, passe mes nuits à noyer mes soucis
J'rattrape mes ières-pri, rien que j'arrête et reprends
L'impression de passer pour un mytho quand je me repens
Je cède aux tentations, lutte contre mes addictions
M'retrouve en contradiction au moindre signe d'ostentation
Question religion, mon son n'obtient aucune bénédiction
À chaque mal, un bien quand j'expertise les interdictions
Ne serait-ce qu'un atome de foi mérite miséricorde
Le Dîn une couverture en attendant que la mort te borde
Mauvais œil, mauvais sort, mauvais djinn dans ton corps
L'orgueil n'a jamais tort, mauvais signes, mauvaise mort
Ils se prosternent devant les lingots, le veau d'or
Respirent que par le bling-bling, mènent une vie de porc
Suis-je hypocrite? Dieu rendra le verdict
Ceux qui critiquent, ne comprennent rien à ce qu'ils récitent
Les disciples du Sheitan me félicitent
Quand je fais du sale et que les biatches me plébiscitent
C'est l'expression des haramis, des haramias
Carré V.I.P., mes reu-frés à fond dans le Dounia
Passe leur le Mathu-Salem
À peine 5 jours de ramadan, Satan sort en perm
T'es en mode Tarawih? Ou en mode chicha?
Après le f'tour en mode samouraï et geisha
Direction l'Enfer, main dans la main
Celards-vi et fiers, on se croit plus malin
Trouverons-nous le temps d'arranger les choses?
La rue a ses pointures et le Sheitan qui les chausse
La vérité écrite de droite à gauche
Mais ce qui t’arrange pas tu l’interprètes à ta sauce
Qu'est-ce qu'j'm'en bats les couilles que certains ne m'aiment pas
Petits ou grands pêchers, tout le monde paiera sa cuenta
J'me livre pour toi, ça me gêne pas
Tu t'reconnais, Dieu pour tous, t'inquiète même pas
Prends c'qu'il te donne même si on n’a pas la même part
Pardonne la jalousie des tiens quand la haine parle
Scarification de l'avant-bras au biceps
J'ai honte de moi comme de ceux qui s'défenestrent
Mon excuse est la hass de ma jeunesse
J'étais mort dans l'fœtus avant qu'je naisse
Un peu d'sagesse nourrie par mes tourments
J'allais mal, seul Abdi était au courant
Téléphone éteint, j'faisais tourner l'CD du Coran
Retenir ses larmes est plus amer que pleurer des torrents
Même le droit chemin peut cacher des mauvais tournants
Dit Subhan'Allāh, tu trouveras plus rien d'étonnant
J'débarque à la mosquée, me glisse dans l'dernier rang
J'ai l'air déconnecté, aurais-je le temps d'Chahed en mourant?
Que Dieu m'préserve, les anges m'observent
Hôtel ou Paradis? C'est toi qui réserves!
L'oseille m'obsède, l'orgueil m'engraine
Images obscènes, quand femmes m'entraînent
Iblis me l'a mise, trahi par mon vice
J'culpabilise devant l'innocence de mon fils
It is, what it is! Combien sont dans mon cas?
Derrière ma bêtise se cachait un petit malaïka
Illimités sont les dégâts, j'ai appris à mes dépens
De la parole aux actes, j'essaie de réduire l'écart
J'ai l'sourire du Joker, joue l'jeu sans les bonnes cartes
Mon bonheur est marbré, mon succès fait du stop-car
On a l'cul entre deux chaises électriques, ma gueule
Le vendredi au Jama'a et le soir en club
J'rappe sur le toit du monde, lyrics vertigineux
Encerclé par le feu, le signe de l'euro dans les yeux
Préférant mourir jeune et riche que pauvre vieux
N'attirant que des matérialistes, bitches et des envieux
Aqua-planning, me v'la au fond d'un ravin
Classe S plié! C'est que du matériel, rien de grave hein
Envie d'bouffer l'monde avant sa fin
On vit au jour le jour sans amour, ni lendemain
Le temps passe, qu'est-ce tu deviens?
Mauvais ou droit chemin, brilles-tu comme il te convient?
On veut des millions mais on sait pas combien, ni comment
Accroche les bonnes personnes, reste à l'affût des bons plans
CO2, pétrole, mine d'or et diamants
Berline allemande, Ferrari, Maserati
Cayenne pour madame et les week-ends en Bugatti
Mets les gosses à l’abri, école privée, Harvard
Valeurs religieuses de côté, fond pervers et avare
On veut s'embourgeoiser comme le prince Albert
Soudoyer des mannequins, ceux qu'ont l'pouvoir savent plaire
Orgie, président italien
Harem, Kadhafi, discrètement dans l'haram saoudien
Comment exaucer ses fantasmes les plus délirants?
Faire la guerre tous les soirs tah Israël-Iran
Mourir doucement dans son lit tel un vieux tyran
D'une crise cardiaque, cancer du foie ou d'la prostate
Crever la bouche ouverte, légitime contraste
Avec cette belle vie offerte par la misère du peuple. Strass,
Paillettes, palaces, jet privé
Maybach blindée sur l'tarmac au départ comme à l'arrivée
Terma, ein-s siliconées, pommettes et lèvres
Tah les chanteuses libanaises collagénées
Bagagerie Louis Vui', Hermès collectionnées
Couturiers shbeb, l'extravagance ovationnée
Hommes et femmes s'confondent, ils imaginent
La beauté suprême humaine représentée par l'androgyne
Sextape machine, pandémonium
L'érosion d'la raison, pire qu'une déflagration à l'uranium
On s'contente plus du minimum, on veut plus que l'maximum
L'oseille mon sel, mon sucre, bitch, bois mon calcium
Très peu de bonhommes classes et d'filles pudiques
Les p'tits s'lâchent et tapent des rails de coke en public
Leasing, location, ça frime à crédit
S'invente des vies pour épater les chtos-mi, rien qu'ça thone-my
“Moi j'ai ci, j'ai fait ça”, ça sort des blazes
Porte les couilles de Tony sans avoir celles de Many, bande de nazes
Ça trinque à la gloire du mal
Ramasse tes folles de cousines déshonorées dans un 5 étoiles
SMS : préliminaire
MMS : gros plans d'ses parties intimes l'air d'en être fières
Elles tiennent très peu d'choses de leurs mères et nous de nos pères
On a la bouche sale, mec, meuf, tous en mode pervers
On s'fait jouir soit même, l'amour est dopé
Pilule aphrodisiaque pour être sûr de bien t'découper
Les plus faibles veulent tout goûter, en perdent la tête
S'réveillent avec des hommes, d'après eux, pour pas mourir bête
Société perverse, cerveaux lobotomisés
La perversité leur fond d'commerce
On s'intègre comme des moutons, l'esprit grégaire
Intérieurement ravagé rhey, c'est l'après-guerre
Mais garde espoir
Si les regrets te déchirent, il manquera une page à l'Histoire
La tête dans l'brouillard, à fumer, broyer du noir
On y voit clair qu'au 20 heures, autant qu'elle devant son miroir
Aussi capitaliste qu'un banquier, plus de sorties que d'rentrées
J'en oublie la ière-pri l'air inquiet
La plupart de nos frères dealent pour ne pas mendier
Pour nous, y'a pas d'taff, le Pôle Emploi nous a radié
Très peu d'entre nous ont l'sens de l'économie
On veut tout et tout d'suite. Le casse-pipe, notre sens de l'autonomie
Le travail sur soi, notre plus grand Jihad
Fais pas le barbu, si t'es corrompu mets-toi au Gilette
Sisi, leurs convictions travesties
On hallalise pas l'argent sale, srab, t'as investi
Aux fornicateurs, les fornicatrices
Gog et Magog, AKA le biff et Leïla Trabelsi
Elle vendrait son âme pour un saphir, rien ne peut lui suffir
Elle flirte avec les flammes tel un fakir
Destin d'kaffir, régi par notre volonté
On s'frotte aux châtiments tel un bon massage thaïlandais
Dounia dans mon cœur, Dounia dans ma tête
Dounia mon bien-être, Dounia mon mal-être
Dounia l'amie d'mes victoires, ennemie d'mes défaites
Dounia les intérêts, les compagnons de la fête
Dounia les idéaux qu'les ignorants interprètent
Ma conscience n'est pas tranquille car je sens qu'elle est traître.

J'allais perforer le trou de balle, tu t'en doutais mais pas à ce point là

Ti amo (t'es à moi)
Ti amo (t'es à moi)
Ti amo (t'es à moi)
Ti amo

Ouvre moi tes bras et pardonne la nature de l'homme
Ma fierté m'abandonne,
Quand nos corps fusionnent
Ton cœur bat pour une étoile et si je t'impressionne
Éteins la lumière, tu ne vois plus personne
""Aimer"" un verbe que la rue apprend à conjuguer
Mes sentiments mineurs oppressés, dans mon cœur ont fugué
L'amour ne peut se truquer, les belles filles manquent d'assurance
Celles qui savent tenir leur mec, peuvent leur faire confiance
On a tous un idéal, mais le sommes-nous pour lui
Les gens n'y croient plus et par dépit, en viennent à se dire oui
Je les comprend pas, la routine ne m'aura pas
Les opposés s'attirent, (ouh) touché l'amour ne mourra pas
Retiens pas tes larmes, les paroles les emportent plus loin
Le vent
Trop de femmes en ligne de mire, à deux on peut se suffire
Pour le meilleur et le pire, fais moi ton plus beau sourire

Ti amo (t'es à moi)
Ti amo (t'es à moi)
Ti amo (t'es à moi)
Ti amo

J'connais la femme car je sors d'elle
Quand son mec a la côte, elle paraît moins sûre d'elle
La rassurer un besoin obsessionnel
Son humilité et sa douceur font d'elle une femme exceptionnelle
Quand un homme est bien à la maison, dehors il est le meilleur
Aucune raison pour lui d'aller voir ailleurs
Le silence est pesant, enfermé dans ce bunker
Espérant que les larmes t'ont lavé d'ces rancœurs
Passionnelles sont les crises
N'te menace pas d'faire une bêtise
Meurtrier, j'ai tué le temps et tu es ma complice
Ne regrette rien, quoi qu'il advienne
Le destin nous sépare toujours pas et veut qu'on s'appartienne
T'es ma number one ma hlel, ma compagnie aérienne
Comprend moi les rois sont faits pour tenir les reines
Yeah, j'vous tourne les pages d'un livre qui commencent par la fin
Comment faire marche arrière ce genre d'amour n'a pas de frein

Tu es mon number one,
Je n'calcule plus personne,
Mon cœur je te le donne,
Tu es l'homme qu'il me faut (t'es à moi)
Le seul homme qui me vaut
Te amo
Tu es mon number one,
Je n'calcule plus personne,

Will color all my dreams

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Diese eine Nacht mit dir

Liegst do immer neben mir

Was ich für dich fühle.

Tät ich alles noch einmal
Noch einmal.

And it's all because of the cynical times

No guiding light that can take control
You can cry all you like
But you still don't speak to a world outside
And it's all because of the sun in your eyes

You can make this deal go underground

No guiding light that can take control

Think the many things they've done to impress,
There's maoism, taoism, I Ching and chess.

I like their tiny little trees,
Their zen, their ping-pong, their ying and yang-eze.

I like chinese thought,
The wisdom that Confusious taught,
If Darwin is anything to shout about,
The chinese will survive us all without any doubt.

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Rolf Ericson,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Rolf Harris,"Spoken
( Waltzing Matilda is a song about an Australian Hobo
I guess you'd call him. He wanders through the bush
land of Australia and he takes all his meagre belongings
wrapped up in an old blanket which is strung across his 
shoulders with an old piece of twine and this is called his swag. 
Hence the name swagman. Now affectionately or otherwise
he refers to his swag as Matilda, its like his only companion 
as he wanders through the bush tracks he finds himself talking 
to it as if its a real person. So the term Waltzing Matilda is nothing 
to do with dancing at all, it means in fact carrying this thing on your
back through the long lonely stretches of the Australian bush.
Couple of other terms quickly, pay attention because I will be
asking questions afterwards about this, couple of other terms. 
A billabong is a pool of deep water, a billy is a little tin can they 
boil the tea in, a jumbuck is a sheep, err tucker bag is a bag for
carrying tucker, food bag tucker is food sort of like a knapsack. 
What else the squatter is the big land owner, that's enough lets
get on with the song.)

Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong
Under the shade of a Coolibah tree
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me

Then down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me

Then down came the squatter mounted on his thoroughbred
Down came the troopers one two three
Right-o where's that jolly jumbuck that you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me
Right-o where's that jolly jumbuck that you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me

So up jumped the swagman and he sprang into that billabong
You'll never take me alive said he
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
You'll come a-waltz ....

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me 

And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong

(Nicholas! Albert! Look, I don't know where they are, but I'd like you to meet my two pals, my buddies, my two amigos. I'll tell you all about them...well...)

I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all.
Until I met my two good amigos, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall. 

Strange as it seems, I met in my dreams, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall.
Here's what they said to me, 'Use your head, just see your life is very, very dull"" 

Well, I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all.
Until I met my two good amigos, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall. 

So I said to Nick, 'Nick tell me quick, what should a fellow do?'
He said to me, 'Boy, easy to see boy, you should try a cigarette or two.' 

Well, I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all.
Until I met my two good amigos, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall. 

So I lit a fag, and I took a drag, then to my great surprise,
I started to gasp, and coughed like a rasp,
And everything spun round before my eyes. 

Well, I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all.
Until I met my two good amigos, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall. 

So I said to Al, 'Al, be a pal, what do you really think?'
He said to me, 'Boy, easy to see boy, smoking's kid's stuff, pour yourself a drink.' 

Well, I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all.
Until I met my two good amigos, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall. 

So quick as a wink, I took a drink, swigged a glassful down.
First it seemed to hit me, then it turned around and bit me,
And everything went all spinning round. 

Well, I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all.
Until I met my two good amigos, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall. 

Well, here is the joke, when I awoke, it wasn't finished yet,
I noticed first a terrible thirst
And then a craving for a cigarette. 

Well, I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all.
Until I met my two good amigos, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall. 

Well, take my advice, this smoking is nice and the drinking is really lush.
As you can see, there's no change in me,
I'm still as pure as the driven slush.

Rolf Harris,"The Cockney tribes in Britain were meeting for the games
Held annually, once a year, along the River Thames,
The scene was quiet and peaceful, the snow lay on the ground
The Cockneys by their cooking pots were huddled all around.
The chief was in his tepee his face all lined with wrinkles
When up the river came the cry 
""someone's pinched me winkles!""
Me winkles have been pinched (oobie dooby) me winkles have been pinched,
Now some people say it's a load of old nonsense but a winkle's got a lot of vitamin contents
Never win that race tomorrow I'll be a big disgrace tomorrow
I'll search the blinking place tomorrow, but tomorrow is too late
Some rotter's pinched me winkles off me plate.
(I turned round and wheeeet, they were gone) 

The tears of sheer frustration started trickling down his face, well
He'd set his heart on winning in the gruelling barrow race,
Without his final winkle feed his training scheme was shot
He staggered round the camp ground shouting ""someone's pinched the lot"" 

Me winkles have been pinched (oobie dooby) me winkles have been pinched
Beef or carrots or a dash of cucumber 
As far as I'm concerned that's a load of old lumber
I'll never win the race tomorrow, he's got me in disgrace tomorrow
He'd better not show his face tomorrow, he'll end up in a fight
But me I need them winkles here tonight.
(now I want 'em, now, not tomorrow or the next day) 

They called the wise old medicine man who shuffled up and said
""I'm levying a winkle tax one winkle each per head""
They made a grand collection from every tucker pot
Then stood around, the shells and all, they made me eat the lot 

I've got me winkles back (oobie dooby) I've got me winkles back
Now I know I've been grumping and grousing
But I never thought I'd get two or three thousand
I'll never win that race tomorrow, I can't go in that race tomorrow
I couldn't stand the pace tomorrow, I'm much to blinking fat
I'll never face a winkle after that.
Phew - I think I'll go and try out something new, you know, just to see how it feels
I think I'll have a dash at some jellied eels. 

(Excuse me a minute while I just get this newspaper off this bit of jellied eel here).
Mmm - that's lovely;
Here, you with the winkle barrow, ""hello"" 
as far as I'm concerned you can stick your perishing winkles right... back in the sea
- it's jellied eels for me.",Someone's Pinched My Winkles

Rolf Harris,"It's lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night where the wild dingoes call
But there's nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer.

Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come
And there's a faraway look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
Oh what a terrible place is a pub with no beer.

Then the stockman rides up with his dry dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar and pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
As the barman says sadly ""The pub's got no beer.""

Then the swaggy comes in smothered in dust and flies
He throws down his roll and rubs the sweat from his eyes
But when he is told he says ""What's this I hear?
I've trudged fifty flamin' miles to a pub with no beer"".

There's a dog on the verandah for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog round a pub with no beer.

Old Billy the blacksmith the first time in his life
Has gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen she says ""You're early my dear""
But then he breaks down and he tells her ""The pub's got no beer"".

Rolf Kühn,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Rolf Kühn,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Rolf Kühn,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Rolf Sturm,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Più forte ti scriverò 

Da quando sei partito 
C'è una grossa novità
L'anno vecchio è finito ormai 
Ma qualcosa ancora qui non va

Si esce poco la sera 
Compreso quando è festa 
E c'è chi ha messo dei sacchi di sabbia vicino alla finestra
E si sta senza parlare per intere settimane 
E a quelli che hanno niente da dire del tempo ne rimane

Ma la televisione ha detto che il nuovo anno 
Porterà una trasformazione 
E tutti quanti stiamo già aspettando
Sarà tre volte Natale e festa tutto il giorno 
Ogni Cristo scenderà dalla croce 
E anche gli uccelli faranno ritorno

Ci sarà da mangiare e luce tutto l'anno 
Anche i muti potranno parlare 
Mentre i sordi già lo fanno

E si farà l'amore ognuno come gli va 
Anche i preti potranno sposarsi 
Ma soltanto a un a certa età
E senza grandi disturbi qualcuno sparirà
Saranno forse i troppi furbi 
E i cretini di ogni età

Vedi caro amico cosa ti scrivo e ti dico 
E come sono contento di essere qui in questo momento
Vedi, vedi, vedi, vedi
Vedi caro amico cosa si deve inventare

I had the right gal
you know when you can know

She had a nice heart and she had a nice smell

She wouldn't let me starve she would helped me eat well

Played the game and tripped up
Knew it wasn't worth it
I'm afraid it messed my life up
I was always paranoid thinking she was slippin up

Stop, get a grip boy, you was the one who was slippin up
If you go astray one day she will go astray
Its up to you its your decision now

Well that you, took me in and made me hold my space
You stood by me in thick and thin and didn't want your face
Now I'm standing I took you for granted

Now I see how much I really want you but its too late
'Cause you gone bad but its all good
This relationship will never be what it cud

Bad bois need a good girl
A girl to keep them focused and got a good girl
Good girls want a bad boy
You be the good girl and I'll be the bad boy

I loved to make you sing
I loved it when you say “Kane you're the greatest”
You're a good girl, my girl, no one else's
I'm selfish you make this a good world

You've got a good heart
You're so good to me
That's more than a good start
You're too good for me

I would even have you live with me
Cook for me
You're an educated girl you can even read a book to me
I love it when you sing

When you hold me close I know we're both
'Cause most boys don't have a girl like you
You're so much like me
I'm so much like you

That's why I like you
I like you personality
When I look at you, an angel the person that I see
I like you smile, your dress sense, your style

Your just a good girl that's what drives me wild

Bad bois need a good girl
A girl to keep them focused and got a good girl (Roll Deep)
Good girls want a bad boy
You be the good girl and I'll be the bad boy

Me jet n joe used to play with danger
I remember when danny mo'catee was a stranger
Boiz in bitteez used to shot with a pager
Gods gift was pepsi and milk were'nt major
I was on front line before I used the big razor
I was a raver cocky little fader
Now I feel blue lights solid gone savour
I got fun, feelings good and bad memories
Times moved on but I got the same enemies
Goin' all out to a snitch ad 2 tell a me
That was in the past now I spit like venomy
Change what ya like but the bad name stays
Lifes to short to be setting your ways
Whatever happened to the good old days?
Those care free days I remember the days!

[Chorus]
I remember when we were young
Your askin to touch you nooooo you nooooo
Memories in life in time my life was on the line
Iv grown I grown ... yeeeee ye yeee

I remember the days I used to be on the street
And no, we can't still survive on the street
You wanted to no, so I'm telling you that life on the
Street can be an eye-opener, I'm watching doors
Open up. Before none of this seemd possible everything
Was impossible didn't stop I was flexible with the hours
And now I'm flexible with the powers I'm strong minded
Some are empty minded troops get divided
They started off as friends and then they collided
I started off at home but now we're separated you see
The loving that we both appreciated it. Before I
Remember when I couldnt leave this chick, I used
To cheat n ting, make hesky beat n ting,
Go home n ave a arguement creating heat n ting!
And then I'm off again I'm tryin'a leave the past behind
Me, I want to live in a place where nobody can find
Me!

I remember dem dayz when I was coming up
Little kid on the rise with the heiness in d eyez
No surprise dat us kids were searchin for sutin more
The different music dat we be sellin' in every store
Back den the days were different the blocks were dark
And evil! Ma line ejak the sequal but das d uk
Version! Hargon was needed to survive on the streetz!
Ya had 2 stay above the water 2 be	 runnin wit ya lete!
School told me to hustle n hustle dat was the code!
The education and stuff had to be put on hold!
You could find me in the smokers corner flippin some coins
Or find me in the cafeteria gettin' double serloins!
I was a little balla balla shud've gone all the way!
Wasn't dedicated, loose canon led me astray!
In ma first move from a little mini coopey
No lay lay coming bak yer bak in the day!

Went the long way, no, took the wrong way,
Flopped and dropped out of college like Kanye,
I don't want to neek, don't want to stray,
Had a fat pocket but crime don't pay,
Just 'cause I let dreams go down stream,
I was too bust with my Islander Cream,
I was born to be a star it seems,
So keep listening and keep your eye on my team,
I've been, laid back from way back when,
The big man I paid back from way back then,
Having power turned my boys to men,
And I'm a real man some bois pretend,
Then again I never had shit to lose,
Two of the feds were on me like shit to shoes,
I had shit to move not shit to prove,
Had two choices and I was quick to choose.

And Ik now you wouldn't want it up ure a-hole,
So if I was you I wouldn't give an opinion, when you might get beaten,
You shouldn't listen to anyone just chatting to anything,
When you criticise me you only boost my adrenaline,
Who the hell are you to tell me you ain't feeling me anyway,
I'm a young heavy weight, you don't want to get weighed,
And have you been mistaked maybe tell me what you take me fore,
I've heard it all before, I'm waiting for it,
Tryna take me for a boi I will not stand for it,

Tough like a batty toast that reached the ceiling,
Hot like jerk but I ain't a chicken,
separate the real from the fake ones,

Rolls-Royce (Coventry Band),"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere

Just how it goes, goes without saying

And by himself it's easy to pretend 
He'll never love again
Ohhh

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
Yeah, I hope you can take it

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix

You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things

I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it",Too Good

Romain Virgo,"When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and  a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more

Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more

Dear you I'm serenading,
My love you've been evading,
No wonder I am blue...Oh listen to my pleading,
Your nearness I am needing,
It's time that you were heeding,
My offering to you...We` Marie, we` Marie,
Quanto sonno agiu perso per te,
Famme` durmi, Una notte abbraciata cu te,

Roman Lob,"Everything that you just said was true
I'm standing here, I can't believe my eyes
As they just try to focus you
Give me just a second

This is my reality
Everything is new
You kicked the doors wide open
And you pushed me through

Dream on, my love, 
Through the clouds and stormy weather
We're counting stars
I love you more than ever

Traffic lights turn blue and that means glide
Tell my friends that I'm alright now
100 Million ways to spend your time
You kicked the doors wide open
And I say

Dream on, my love, 
Through the clouds and stormy weather
We're counting stars
I love you more than ever

Roman Lob,"Guess we knew this was coming on
'Cause you're already gone in my head
You can tell me that I'm wrong
That you're staying with me instead

The wind has come along
And summer's dead and gone
Is there anything left here to say?

I can put my arms around
The emptiness I found
Find a way to make you stay

But I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you leave me now

I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you're walking out

I'm just standing still

Now before I feel strong
Pieces of me break so easy

What I thought of the end
Just the feeling that you freed me
Girl these aren't
It's nowhere to stop
Everything is over

I know my life is
For the first time
Things ain't got to be as closer

But I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you leave me now
Yeahaahahahahhh

I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you're walking out

I'm standing still
I'm just standing still
As you leave me now
I'm just standing still",Standing Still
