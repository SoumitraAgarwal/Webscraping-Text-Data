Johnny Philko,"What about me? Mr. President 
All of my money 
I done spent 
I prayed to the Lord 
But nothin's been sent 

Can't you see 
I'm down at your feet 
About like a dog 
Beggin' for a scrap of meat 

I'm counting on you 
To carry me through 

What about them Lord 
They can't pay their rent 
Maybe they should all go out 
And live in a tent 

The answers unkind 
It could blow your mind 
What about me? Mr. President",What About Me? (Mr. President)
Johnny Powers,"Well, I get rattled every time we meet
I get rattled even in my sleep
I get rattled, baby, over you

I get twisted, I get turned around
I get twisted, and I'm up then I'm down
I get twisted, baby, over you

Well, baby, baby, baby won't you save one night for me
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control
It may look like nothing's wrong but deep down in my soul
I'm twisted - shaken - rattled
I get rattled, baby, over you

Rattled baby, over you

Johnny Powers,"Well if you see somebody knocking on your door
If you see somebody crawling out across the floor
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll be looking for you

If you see somebody in your living room hall
If you see somebody crawling up a totem pole
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll be looking for you

I'll be searching in the mountains
In the deep blue sea
Well I'll be looking in the fountains
I'll be climbing every tree

If you see something happening on a fishing hook
If you see a funny face in a comic book
Baby, it'll be me
I'll be looking for you

Johnny Preston,"SPOKEN:A ho ho ho......It was the night before Christmas and 
everthing was real quiet. So I thought I'd take myself a little 
walk at Christmas Eve Night. I was makin' it on down the street, 
when to my surprise I saw this little bitty cat with big old 
tears in his eyes. Now I could see he was standin' in front of 
this music store and looked real brought down. I could hear what 
he was sayin', he didn't know I was around...he say.....

I want a rock an' roll guitar
With a big bass string
I want a rock an' roll guitar
So I can play the thing

I wanna be on t.v.
Like a rock an' roll star
I want Santa Claus to bring me
A rock an' roll guitar

SPOKEN: ha ha ha.....so-a I walked over to him-a 'cause I understand.
I, I thought I'd cheer him up so I say, ""Look-a-here little man,
A-you don't want no rock an' roll guitar, you want a six gun like
the Lone Ranger has, so you can run around sayin'-a hi ho Silver,
Kimo sabe, and all that cowboy jazz. Or how would you like old Santa 
to bring you a little dump truck so you could go around a-dumpin' 
things"".....And he say, ""Man, I don't want no dumptruck, I want 
somethin' that swings"".....He say.....

I want a rock an' roll guitar
With a big bass string
I want a rock an' roll guitar
So I can play that thing

SPOKEN: Ha, ha, wait a minute there, wait a minute, hold on, hold on 
I say. I say, hold on there little fellow, ah why don't you be like 
the little chicks and cats and wish for a space helmet or a 
rocketship or something wild like that? And you know what he say? He 
say.....""Look here dad, I don't want no plane or no train or nothin' 
square like that, that ain't the lick for me. Wwhen I awake this 
whole place is gonna shake, 'cause you know what I want under my 
Christmas tree!""....He say.....

Well, rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
So rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows, mmm

Well, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jumped over the candlestick
He jumped so high up above
He landed in the cradle of love

The cow jumped over the moon
And on the way down she met a turtle dove
Said ""Let's go rockin' in the cradle of love""

To get a pail of water

Johnny Preston,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Johnny Q Public,"Stay here and keep watch over me as I pray
My soul is overwhelmed, death becomes me
Watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation
The spirit is willing, but the body is weak, so weak
I fall to my face in the garden

Father keep me in Your presence
Don't let me fall away
For my lack of understanding
is impatient and demanding
and asking why this way
As I pray
My friend, do what you came here for
Then desert your faith
pass me into the hands of sinners
With a kiss I am betrayed
I am betrayed, I am betrayed

Life's why you won't take this cup away, away

",Here I Am
Johnny Reid,"

Seemd everytime things are looking up

The sky comes crashing down

Seems everytime we spread our wings

We're chained to the ground

These troubled times never seem to fade away

But it won't be long 'till these dark clouds reveal better days


I promise you

Whatever we run into

As sure as I am I'll never let go of your hand

I promise you we'll fly up in sky's of blue

Our love will pull us through I promise you


With innocence lost where do you run

To get out of the storm

Dry your tears the only shelter you need

Is right in my arms

Take a deep breath and just hold on to me believe

You belong in the sun now baby right here next to me


I promis you

Whatever we run into

As sure as I am I'll never let go of your hand

I promise you we'll fly up in sky's of blue

Our love will pull us through I promise you


Take a deep breath and just hold on to me, believe

You belong in the sun now baby right here next to me


I promise you

Whatever we run into

As sure as I am I'll never let go of your hand

I promise you we'll fly up in sky's of blue

Our love with pull us through I promise you...


",I Promise You
Johnny Reid,"Ain't it funny how life 
Is measured in time 
Ain't it funny how fate 
Never leaves it too late 
I heard a heavenly song 
I started singing along 
Still I can't believe 
That you sent her here to me 

She fell from the sky 
Right into my life 
Through a hole in the clouds 
All her friends were looking down 
I found her crying in the rain 
Well I helped her mend her wings 
When she never flew back 
Lord, I knew for a fact 
That you were missing an angel 

Well Is she here to save us all 
Or just to catch me when I fall 
Is she part of your plan 
To make me a better man 
Every night I say a prayer 
That in the morning she'll be there 
And if I die before I wake 
Chalk it up to give and take 

She fell from the sky 
Right into my life 
Through a hole in the clouds 
All her friends were looking down 
I found her crying in the rain 
Well I helped her mend her wings 
When she never flew back 
Lord, I knew for a fact 
That you were missing an angel 

When she never flew back 
Lord, I knew for a fact 
That you were missing an angel 

Missing an angel",Missing An Angel
Johnny Reid,"

Here I am an this road

Thousand miles from her

There's an echo in my soul

Like waves against her shores

She's the place that I go

When I find myself alone

With her fields of purple heather

And her fences made of stone

She calls me home


Something that I always felt inside

A dream I had to chase

And a mountain I just had to climb

To see what's on the other side

It doesn't really matter how lost I get

Or how far I roam

She calls me home


She's the comstant strength in my restless heart

She's the reason why

I got this far in the first place

Her voice rings clear in the back of my mind

When I can't go on

She calls me home


She calls me home


There's only one place where my roots run deep

There's only one place where I can swing

In my family tree

I know what it means to me

It doesn't matter how lost I get

Or how far I roam

She calls me home..


",She Calls Me Home
Johnny Reid,"

Sixty to Zero:

She had blue eyes, the colour

Of Amarillo skies in summer

And when we'd fly

Her hair would wrap around me


The smell of leather and gasoline

A little danger sitting next to me

And when I was with her

Man, I never felt so alive


Sky was red, I was green

Road was black, seventeen

She was fast, I was slow

She was all I could hold

Summer flew, she was gone

Little did I know my heart could go

From sixty to zero


We'd sit in my car night after night

Watchin' the stars as they flew by

We'd go 'round the world at the speed of light

And never turn the key


Still I wonder where she might be

And if she ever stops and thinks about me

'Cause God knows

I sure think about her


(Repeat Chorus)


Sixty to zero


We loved and laughed enough to last a lifetime

But at least for a little while she was mine


(Repeat Chorus)

To never fall again
I put up a defence
And I let nobody in
How can I forgive
The way you left my heart
How can I forget
When I'm reminded by a scar

And how do I erase a tear
That's fallen on my page
I don't know where we went wrong
But I know this ain't no love song
Yeah I know this ain't no love song
But I wish it was

there's no one here to blame
So I guess it's up to me
To look the other way
Even though it's hard to see


And how do I erase a tear
That's fallen on my page
I don't know where we went wrong
But I know this ain't no love song
Yeah I know this ain't no love song

Can you feel my pulse oh what a rush
You got me thinkin' like the devil in the name of love

You took my farther than I've been before
And when I thought I couldn't take any more
You turned it up

I'm like a rock lyin' in the desert
After the rain just soakin' up steam
You're like the sun bearin' down upon me

Johnny Rivers,"Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find a party that tried to get in touch with me
She did not leave a number but I know who placed the call
'Cause my uncle took a message and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

Last time I saw Marie she was wavin' me goodbye
With ""hurry-home"" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
We were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
She tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old, information please
You got to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee",Memphis

A paper in her hand

To try to free her man

Weepin' my heart out till cold gray dawn
Prayin' that you're lonely and you come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere up above
High on a mountain of love

A mountain of love, a mountain of love, you should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin' and they shoulda been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, my dreams gone above

He don't love you like I love you

Johnny Rivers,"Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight

We go on, like the actors in a play
Acting out our lives from day to day

Going through our phrases
With smiling, frozen faces
That tell more than they hide

And knowing when we fake it
It's not love when you make it
Without any feelin' inside

That's all we are, we're over
And all that's left is to find a reason why
We're over, and we still can't say goodbye",We're Over

We were down on the Rio Grande

Strolling with my lover hand and hand

Endless highways and wide-open spaces
Children smile with their sun burned faces

Was the sweetest part of living

'Cause Jesse's drinking came before the groceries and the rent
Among the local women there'll be a slack in cheating
Cause Jesse won't be stepping out again

The scars on Jesse's knuckles are more than just respected
The county courthouse records tell all there is to tell
The pockets of the gamblers will soon miss Jesse's money
And a black eye of the law will soon be well

All around a pug-nosed dream

We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand

Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed
I still love you so

Johnny Smith,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And laughed before, and loved before

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",Ghost of a Chance

Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true

Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

Johnny Smith,"Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days

Forsooth, was mine

Johnny Smith,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Johnny Smith,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
Just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
Is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
And when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
And if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
It's a duty that we owe to dear old France.
Isn't it romance?",Isn't It Romantic?

A prelude to a kiss

When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, with the sweet smell of apples,
And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time just for livin', a place for to die.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.

Johnny Smith,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Johnny Smith,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You
Johnny Smith,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Johnny Smith,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Johnny Smith,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Johnny Smith,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Johnny Smith,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Johnny Smith,"When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Johnny Smith,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.

People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love
Johnny Smith,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Johnny Smith,"I wander out yonder o'er the hills
Where the mountains high
Seem to kiss the sky

I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair

Johnny Smith,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air. 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair.",Scarlet Ribbons
Johnny Smith,"There's a saying old says that love is blind

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

And it sure got to be a change when you start to scream and shout

You change on into the wolf man howlin' at the moon

All the smart boys know why,
It doesn't mean I didn't try,
I just never know why.
Feel so cold and all alone,
Cause baby, you're not at home.
And when I'm home
Big deal, I'm still alone.

Feel so restless, I am,
Beat my head against a pole
Try to knock some sense, 
Down in my bones.
And even though they don't show,
The scars aren't so old

Johnny Tillotson,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind",Always on My Mind
Johnny Tillotson,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

I can still hear Papa, what he said
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you",Patches

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Johnny Tillotson,"RHYTHM OF THE RAIN
(John Gummoe)
Â« Â© '63 Chappell-Morris Â»

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain, Telling me just what a fool I've been. I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain, And let me be alone again. Now the only girl I've ever loved has gone away. Looking for a brand new start! But little does she know that when she left that day. Along with her she took my heart. Rain, please tell me, now does that seem fair For her to steal my heart away when she don't care I can't love another, when my heart's somewhere far away. Rain, won't you tell her that I love her so Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow Rain in her heart and let the love we know start to grow.

Johnny Tillotson,"Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
And after you've loved me for a million years
Then if it don't work out then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If you must go I won't grieve
If you'll just wait a lifetime before you leave
If you must go I won't say no but so we can say that we try
Tell me you love me for a million years

Ain't got time to oil the hinges nor to mingle the window panes

This ole house stands in the rain this ole house stands in the cold
Oh my knees are gettin' chilly but I feel no fear or pain
Cause I can see an angel peekin' through a broken window pane

I ain't a gonna need this house no longer

This ole house is afraid of thunder this ole house is afraid of storms

For that same smile he dreams up too oh what am I gonna do

I've seen you out with him though you've not seen me
You looked into his eyes and said words you said to me
Each time he holds you close something happens to me

Handed me the gun and said I'll see you around

I've been a fool just takin' the blame for you
You finally made front page news
You double crossed another man
Took his life with your own hand

I ain't sayin' I'm feelin' nice
Now it's your turn to pay the price
I know I'll see you in hell

I been lookin' for a woman for so long
But you ain't even that girl
So, quit hangin' on and on

I put my trust in you now, baby, that's a fact
I put my trust in you and you stabbed me in the back
And I put my trust in you and you let me down
If I was you, baby, I'd just get all out of town
Get goin', baby

Oh, you playin' kind of hurt now
Lookin' real sad
Damn, don't just stand there girl
Go and pack your bags

I know just what I'm gonna do about you
Kick your ass out the door girl
And find somebody new

This old world is gettin' harder

Oh, you better get off your pride
'cause there's nowhere left for you to hide
And it's gonna be hard
Just to make it through another day

Stand your ground
Don't ever let nobody hold you down
Stand your ground
Don't ever let no one hold you down

It's a long lonely road
It takes a certain kind of man
To carry this load
And if you want it all you gotta do is try

So, get back on your feet
And get out in the street
Make somethin' of yourself
It's time to be a man

Stand your ground

Where love once was, now nothing is there
You once lived for me, but now you don't care
If love is war baby nothings fair

You left me with a hunger Thai time won't erase

I believed in you, you were the only one
Looking back I was better off playing with a loaded gun

Love can be so cruel
Love can take you for a fool
Love can be blind, if you think love is true
It'll open your eyes oh baby 
Love can be so cruel, love can be cruel

Two different minds look through two sets of eyes
And two different hearts, living two separate lives
We just can't agree, so we stop asking why
Cause sometimes the truth hurts more than the lie
It's over now and we can't pretend (can't pretend)
Same thing that made us happy 
Makes us cry in the end

Johnny Western,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

The kind that don't feel any pain
Why can't I be like the kind that don't mind

Johnny Winter,"Ooh, you're the kind of girl who could change my world
If you just take hold of my hand now
Make the mountains scream, drive my brain machine
But you don't seem to understand now

Turn me inside out and upside down
Take me down low
But you keep it hidden deep inside
So it's got nowhere to go

Don't hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't hide the love that you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

You got miles and miles of deep-sea smiles
But I never seen them surface
You got this and that and the other thing
But you don't realize their purpose

How can you be so damn naive?
You cause me some frustration
You keep it under lock and key
Why don't you try my combination?

Don't you hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't you hide your love that you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

Such a dirty deal

Don't hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't hide your love 'cause you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

Such a dirty deal
Such a dirty deal
Don't hide your love
Oh girl
",Don't Hide Your Love
Johnny Winter,"Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all kiddin' you

You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be on your own with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
Don't you know you only used to get juiced in it?
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say,""Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all came down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You should never let other people get your kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at?
After he's taken everything he could steal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, and you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Peep out the front door--I hear the back door slam.

Take off your troubles,
You've been wearing them too long

You've got to reach out,
Reach out for a hand to hold
You've got to take some rest,
And restore your soul
And lay down your sorrows
Lay down your sorrows
You're havin' such a hard time

I looked out my window and saw my baby walk away 

I thought Lord, please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no mo' 
I thought Lord, please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no mo' 
I hollered out my window, ""Come back baby please don't go"" 

I know she heard me callin', she looked back and waved her hand 
I know she heard me callin', she looked back and waved her hand 
I could hear her tell her mother, ""That's one no good man!""

I'd give anything I have, just to see my little girl again",Mother In Law Blues
Johnny Winter,"It had rained for 3 days straight
But the sun was beginning to shine
Two riders were approachin?
But they were no friends of mine.

Called out for Hanna
And I kept here close to my side
Whistled for old Thunder
And my horse he was ready to ride

CHORUS:
I give you everything I had babe
Ain?t that kindness
I give you the good with the bad babe
Ain?t that kindness
Don?t cha know I give you my love when say babe
Ain?t that kindness
Hmmm ya know a man ain?t nothing without his gun
Ya know a man ain?t nothing without his gun

2nd Verse:
Took to the road 6 night and days
Only then did we think it was safe
Heard the sound of 2 men approachin?
But they did not hesitate 

Hanna she was cryin?
But she wouldn?t let go of my leg
Thunder he was tired
Been a thinkin? of a better day

Repeat Chorus:

3rd Verse:
Two shots fired and two figures fell
There was blood flowin? over the ground
Two men dead in the noon day sun
And they never ever made a sound

Hanna she never forgave me
And I think I know the reason why
When I called out for Thunder
The horse he up and died.

Repeat Chorus:

We can dance all day

Johnny Winter,"As time begins to burn itself upon me
And the days are growing very short
People try their hardest to reject me
But in a way, their conscience won't be caught

Something's happen to me day by day
My pebble on the beach is getting washed away
Given everything that was mine to give
Now I'll turn around and find that there's no time to live

So often, I have seen that big wheel of fortune
Spinning for the man, who holds the ace
There's many that would change their places for him
But none of them have ever seen his lonely face

Something is happening to me day by day
My pebble on the beach is getting washed away
Given everything that was mine to give
And now I'll turn around and find that there's no time to live",No Time to Live
Johnny Winter,"Woke up inside myself this morning, uncertainty all around
Got straight and turned on to some happiness, then I lay back down, all there was around
Nothing left but ashes, and the smell

Went down to the corner drug store, the pain was more than I could bare
They told me that I was illegal, I told them I don't care, let them stand and stare
Nothin' left but old bones, and the smell

I know I can't go on, I just can't stand the pain, can't stand the pain,
I know I just can't stand 
Guess I'll go insane, go insane

Guess I was born to be mistreated, contentment seems too hard to find
Searchin' for some understandin', then I lost my mind, left it far behind
Nothing left but memories, and the smell",Nothing Left

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

I met a man who lost his way.

He said I'm the son
Of a sailor
Who never showed me his face.

Oh to hell with that place.

And her daddy hung the moon.
In her eyes, he could do no wrong.

But then he started drinking
Like there's a message in the bottle.
Now daddy's painting Peggy black and blue.

She closes her eyes
Through the hero's demise.
Holds to her hope beyond the sky.

She takes a breath.
Weight comes off her chest.
She finds a way to weather through the storm.

She cried out home.
I need me some home.
Oh I need some home.
(Some home)

I found myself on a train to California.
At twenty-five years of age.
Set beside me was a lonely rose of wanderer.
Two's always better they say.

So we made our plans.
She gave me a hand.
We ain't go no time for looking back.

I was bruised and beaten.
Lost for many reasons.

Now I'm grown, girl
And if I hit you with a dick one time
You'll be gone, girl
Let's get it on, girl
We'll let the Marvin Gay play
While J do it all night long, girl
I'm in the zone, girl
Turn up your radio
And I guarantee that you'll hear one of my songs, girl
I write hits, gotta crib wit' a elevator in it
Ain't drop one single of my own, girl
Well, back to the groove
Fill the patron more
Baby, you want more
And I'm built to last
Slow motion or fast
We'll have a blast
Get spots you ain't even know you had
Now here's an idea
We ain't waitin' for the crib
Pull over the 550
Let's do it right here
And it seemin' like a dope fiend need a little more in love 
So, baby, turn it up

One time for Jagged Edge

Masilayan nga ba ang ngiti sa iyong mukha?!

Ang tinig?.ang tinig?..
Sabihin mo sa?kin kung ayaw mong marinig?

Pa?no iiwasan kalimutan kang tawagan
Eh kasi..ayoko nga?walang magagawa?

Joja Wendt,"I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I get a lot of pleasure
With a spano' keys
Underneath my finger tips
Tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah
I love to have a supple melody
Just tricklin' off o' my lips

A handful of keys
And a song to sing
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to tinkle on an old piana
I like to play it in a subtle mannah
I know I'll always be the top banana
With a handful of keys

JoJo,"Come with me, stay the night
You say the words but boy it don’t feel right
What do you expect me to say
You know it’s just too little too late
You take my hand, and you say you’ve changed
But boy you know your begging don’t fool me
Because to you it’s just a game
You know it’s just too little too late

So let me on now
Cause time has made me strong
I’m starting to move on
I’m gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know

It’s just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can’t wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it’s just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don’t like me, you just like the chase
To be real it doesn’t matter anyway
You know it’s just too little too late

It’s just too little too late

I was young and in love
I gave you everything but it wasn’t enough
And now you wanna communicate
You know it’s just too little too late
Go find someone else
In letting you go I’m loving myself
You got a problem but don’t come asking me for help
Cause you know

It’s just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can’t wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it’s just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don’t like me, you just like the chase
To be real it doesn’t matter anyway
You know it’s just too little too late

I can love with all of my heart
Baby I know I have so much to give (I have so much to give)
With a player like you
I don’t have a prayer
That’s the way to live

It’s just too little too late

It’s just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can’t wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it’s just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don’t like me, you just like the chase
To be real it doesn’t matter anyway
You know it’s just too little too late

You know it’s just too little too late
I can’t wait

It’s just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can’t wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it’s just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don’t like me, you just like the chase
To be real it doesn’t matter anyway

Let me break it down, break it down
I got it on lock and
I think you better stop
I heard you been checking for my boo
Who do you think he is, busy giving your best shot
But you couldn't get a call back
And even after all that
Caught you at the mall for a throwback
That's big pimping but you
Wouldn't listen, he's mine
Not yours but a fall back

Of the realest of the real

It was everything that I dreamed of
He was my gem and I was his pearl
Nothing could come between us
A prince charming to call my own

And left me wondering all alone

Used to believe in fairy tales (In fairy tales)

I've just started to learn (La da da dee, oh)
There's no such thing as fairy tales

Is a good story supposed to end
Unhappily ever after
Just as wonderful as it begins
And carry on for a few chapters
Baby how come each time I open up
I can't seem to get past stage one
I guess it's time for me to close up
And go back on the shelf because I'm done

Why do my dreams seem so far (Why they seem so far)
Up above the world so high
Won't somebody tell me why (Can you help me)
Can you help me out
Can you tell me what love is all about
Cause I never known it for myself (Don't believe in fairy tales)
That's why I don't believe in fairy tales no more

Under covers talking on the phone
Here comes my mother
It's way too late
Might get in trouble
My heart can't wait (So much to take)
Writing till my hand cramps up

Can't get you off my mind (Come pick me up baby)

Whatever it is that you do when you do what you doing
It's a feeling that I want to stay

Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

I will overcome

Already do
Feelings can grow but
They can go away too
You're taking my hand
Looking into my eyes
Don't be in a rush to get me tonight
I feel something happening
Could this be a spark?
To satisfy me, baby
Got to satisfy my heart

Do you know how to touch a girl?
If you want me so much
First I have to know
Are you thoughtful and kind?
Do you care what's on my mind
Or am I just for show?
You'll go far in this world
If you know how to touch a girl
(Do you know how to touch, know how to touch a girl?
Do you know how to touch, know how to touch a girl?)

I think I could like you
But I keep holding back
'Cause I can't seem to tell
If you're fiction or fact
Show me you can laugh
Show me you can cry
Show me who you really are
Deep down inside
Do you feel something happening?
Could this be for real?
I don't know right now
But tonight we'll reveal

Do you know how to touch a girl?
If you want me so much
First I have to know
Are you thoughtful and kind?
Do you care what's on my mind
Or am I just for show?
You'll go far in this world
If you know how to touch a girl
(Do you know how to touch, know how to touch a girl?
Do you know how to touch, know how to touch a girl?)

Bring me some flowers
Conversation for hours
To see if we really connect
And maybe if we do, oh
I'll be giving all my love to you
Oh

Do you know how to touch a girl?
If you want me so much
First I have to know
Are you thoughtful and kind?
Do you care what's on my mind
Or am I just for show?
You'll go far in this world
If you know how to touch a girl

JoJo,"Let it rain
Let it rain

From the first day I met ya, I noticed your style
Had that B-boy swagger, not one of the crowd
And you talked like you knew me, kept comin' around
And I fell for ya, yeah

Then as time kept going I noticed some things
That our love kept growing, wanted to run away
'Cause the situations in the past; love never really lasts
Memories just had a hold of me, oh

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me (let it rain)
'Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Showed me things I could never see (let it rain)
'Cause we can fight, and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'll stay with you only (let it rain)
'Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)

I used to wonder where we're going, and where I wanted to be
Sittin' alone, all shook up when I found my destiny
Hearing songs on the radio, wishin' that could happen for me, oh oh (oh oh)
Then when you came in the picture, then I knew quickly
That we could build something so strong
Expect the best for the future, forget about what used to be
I need you here all life long

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me
On me (let it rain)
'Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Showed me things I could never see
Never see (let it rain)
'Cause we can fight, and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'll stay with you only
Stay with you only (let it rain)
'Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be
Love should really be (let it rain)

'Cause I see the sunlight whenever we touch
All day and all night; it's never too much
Afraid of my feelings and falling too deep
But everybody's had this happen one time or another
When you need someone to set your heart free, oh oh

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me (let it rain down, down on me, yeah)
'Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Showed me things I could never see (let it rain)
'Cause we can fight, and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up, whoa, whoa
I'll stay with you only, oh oh
'Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be
Love should really be (let it rain)

But I had to let go of the pain
Let love rain down on me
Down on me, baby (let it rain)
'Cause you helped me open up my eyes
Showed me things I could never see (let it rain)
'Cause we can fight, and we make up
Wanna see you when I wake up
I'll stay with you only (let it rain)
'Cause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)

And it looks like we haven't got a clue
Need some help from You

Grant us the faith to carry on
Give us hope when it seems our hope is gone

I made the mistake like before
Givin' you the third degree
Takin' you through it
I told you I get what I want
And I ain't tryin' to hear nothin' else
But just do it
Then I had to take a good look
When everything else didn't have a ring to it
I'm sittin' here blamin' myself
When I saw what you were feelin' inside and misused it

This time it's all my fault
This time I can't let go
This time I did it really, but I got these feelings
How am I supposed to know?
Can't let my weakness show
Have my fits may 'cause me to miss this first chance at real love

This time I won't let you get away from me
This time I'm gonna let you take it where it should be
This time I won't say no

And I'm not tryin' to be the next one goin' through it
I see that I got something real
And I don't wanna lose it
I gotta say thank you
The thought of you gone gives me chills
So, baby, let's just put this aside and come here

This time it's all my fault
This time I can't let go

Burning up for forever and always, always
Yeah yeah yeah

'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now we're saying never
Feel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way
Look for another day, 'cause it ain't the same my baby
Watch it all fall into the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

When I wasn't playing smart now I'm being wise
Finally I'm moving on and I don't need your lies

Tension building up and I'd feel so small
Some nights I'd hide under the pillows 'cause I didn't know what else to do
Started singing just to get some attention
A melody to cut through the addiction
And every song I made turned into wishes
Some of them came true

Everyone rises, everyone falls
Everyone spends some nights alone
Rich or for poor
I'm always yours
You never left me on my own

Every time I bet my life on you

I used to go to work with her some days
And dream and dance in the big hallways

JoJo,"Wake up like a quarter to twelve
Hoping that today I'll be someone else
So dumb how I talk to myself
This is hell on earth but I can turn it into heaven

Makes me mad
All of the lost time
Only left here to realize
What makes me mad
Can't open up my eyes

Just when I think it's over
Just when I think I've lost my mind

Went a little crazy yesterday
Everybody saw, but it's okay
Swimming in a river of my feels
Looking in the mirror, like what's the deal
Now, now, no matter what the doctor's offered me
Gonna shake that dark cloud off of me
Finally know how fast I gotta run
Now I'mma move for my kingdom come
Always on the move for a rainy day
Needed to change

JoJo,"Got you drunk for your first time, definitely not mine
You missed church on Sunday
We were still fucked up from the Saturday night
Few tequila shots later in my hotel room naked
You said we should've waited
But I turned off all of the lights and took you to the dark side

I was young and I was up to no good, up to no good
I loved you in the only way that I could, way that I could

I was reckless with your heart
I took for granted the gift that you handed

To get you back to where you started from
Sometimes I wish I could meet her

Someone left me in the way that I left you

It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me

Hit so hard, no wonder I'm shakin'
Knock me to the ground, heart fall down

Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver
Runnin' right down my spine

So dizzy and dazed
Completley amazed
Fallin' in record time

And all you did was walk into the room
Heart fall down, go boom

Flash of lightning
Crash of thunder
Helpless, breathless
Goin' under

Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver
Runnin' right down my spine

So dizzy and dazed
Completley amazed
Fallin' in record time

And all you did was walk into the room
Heart fall down, go
Heart fall down, go boom

Oh, heart fall down, go

Jolie Holland,"I saw you tonight by the light
Of the shining black stars that circle my heart
I saw you come in, though it was dim
I have been listening from the beginning

When you arrived
It was as if we had both died
And gone somewhere else
You and myself
That otherworldly feeling
Came over me stealing

My mind was reeling
Blood bleeding
Red like my guitar
Whoever you are
Cold in the night
I think you're right
To whisper and listen
Like flowers glisten
In a quiet garden
The moon is wizened and it is old
As a toad in a Chinese story

The fallen glory of my ego
Is laid at the feet of all our purposes
And my purpose is to keep on dreaming
I am fishing for wishes that's where you come in
Though it was dim when you arrived
It was as if we had both died
And gone somewhere else

And walking this line of mine

Are good at ignoring them
But I just can't put these thoughts down
I'm harrowed and abused and broken and pursued
By this notion that follows me around

My heart is hurting, my spirit?s burdened
I feel like a liar and a thief
For taking air, for being here
Unwanted, I look for my final release

Goodbye, goodbye, California
Goodbye and I?ll be moving on
I sang you my songs, I know I'm wrong
Fare thee well and I?ll be moving on

When I'm dead and gone
My immortal home will hold me in its bosom
Safe and cold, no more desires
Will light their fires or disturb my immaculate calm

And the birds of the air and the beasts of the soil
And the fishes of the desperate seas
Will know who I am and our substance will expand
As part of everything

As part of everything, my God
As part of everything and the clouds will roll
And the wind will blow and the beautiful birds will sing

Goodbye to your waving trees
To you succulent wind and all my friends
Fare thee well, goodbye, so be it

My lonesome lover has taken off
I'm wondering around on a cloud
Empty heart, I've been down and out

It's been a week I think since he wrote and it's sad
And it's been years that I've heard these stories about this
Fella he's so brave and so alive
Turning this world around from the out to the inside

Well our courtship was brief and magnetic
I was singing at the corner bar
And we both felt so romantic
We took a walk with the moon
Down to the train yard

Well it was too much for me
My gypsy heart was inflammed
Put me at the head of your list
And don't forget to call my name
Well I fell in love with a boy
Who has a real life romance with a train

Oh my beautiful lover and friend
This is exactly what I wanted
And now I'm feeling so haunted
And I can't get you outta my mind

I can't forget him, as he's rolling away, and it's

Just to stay",Sascha

Nothing you do is done
And I can tell, you are not real
Girl, what are you doing here

I don't know why, I am here myself
No one else seems to know

Nobody likes a spook or so I've deduced
But I have loved some ghosts in my time
But that doesn't mean I want them around
I'd rather be lost than found, I thought I would loose my mind

But through your eyes I see
Past the billboards to the trees
And the flowering weeds
Grow through the cracks of the city

And all these things will go
And all these seeds will grow
And you'll be home in the sky

He will never have to hear what I had to say
My little words are lost in the wind
With no where to go and I am just like them

There's a voice in the alley in the cold bare arms of a tree
When the moon sails high, a ghost ship in a dark and lonely sea
Mockingbird, your song burns right through me
I know why you singing, all the day and every night

Like that little mockingbird, high up in the pine
All I do is worry, all I do is cry
We're lost in the shadows of a beautiful spring

",Mehitabel's Blues
Jolie Holland,"You're like a saint's song to me
I'll try to sing it pure and easily
You're like a Mexican blue
So bright and clear and pale in the afternoon

I saw you riding on your bike
In a corduroy jacket in the night
Past the hydrangeas that were blooming in the alley
With a galloping dog by your side

When I was hungry you fed me
I don't mean to suggest that I'm like Jesus Christ
Your light overwhelmed me
When I lay beside you sleepless in the night

And when you dreamed my guardian spirits appeared
And the moon stretched out across your little bed
They said they'd started to get worried about me
They were happy we had finally met, we had finally met

A mysterious bird flies away
Seemed to be calling your name
And bounced off the top of a towering pine
And vanished in the drizzling rain

There's a mockingbird behind my house
Who is a magician of the highest degree
And I swear I heard him rip the world apart
And sew it back again with his fiery melody, melody

When you were mad at me I didn't care
And I just loved you all the same
And I waited for the wind to push the hurricane
Out to sea, and the sun could shine again

Oh, I don't mean to give you advice
It's just like Delia said, ""Oh, Jesus Christ""
Just don't get so high you leave the ground
Everything is so much better when you're around

Just don't float so high you drift away
Stand tall, with your feet on the ground
I love your songs, I love your sound
Everything is so much better when you're around

When the moon is as clear as an opal
And the amethyst river sings a song
I'll remember all your dreams and the mysteries
You have borne in your crystalline soul

That you sing from your golden throat
That you shine from your sparkling eyes
That you feel from the goddess in your thighs, oh

You're like a saint's song to me
I'll try to sing it pure and easily
You're like a Mexican blue
So bright and clear and pale in the afternoon

About someone I barely knew at all
He was a friend of my friends and they told me about him
How he had nothing to break his fall

He had that bad religion in his blood
The kind that brings you down and can never lift you up

He was a beautiful young man on the streets of Austin
He was a ghost faced junkie on the streets of New Orleans
I could barely recognize him when I saw him
He had to look me in the face and say my name before I knew it was him

Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend

What if they only gave you love when you lied?
It's bound to really rip you up inside
Pressures a person into that horrible mouth that leaves a bloody aftermath
Everything minus one is everything

He treated me with what I considered kindness
When I crawled off to sleep in my car he was worried about me
When we payed our respects to the moon on the outskirts of Austin
I'm sorry to say I was too shy to stay in touch with him

Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend

And I wonder what it takes just to save one little life
Icarus almost made it back to the shore
When I was really down, there were three little words
From a couple of good people that kept me holding on

Oh buddy, I'll never get a chance again
Oh buddy, I wish I'd been a better friend
Oh buddy, I'll never get a chance again

Are you shedding a tear

If you feel like I do

You show a smiling face
I feel like the dark side

Jolly Rogues,"Near Banbridge Town,
In the County Down
One morning last July,
Down a bóithrín green
Came a sweet colleen,
And she smiled as she passed me by.
She looked so neat
From her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair,
Such a coaxing elf,
Sure, I shook myself
To make sure I was standing there.

Chorus:
From Bantry Bay
Up to Derry Quay,
And from Galway to Dublin Town,
No maid I've seen
Like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down.








As she onward sped,
Sure I turned my head
And I gazed with a feeling rare.
And I says, says I,
To a passer-by:
""Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?""
He smiled at me
And he says, says he,
""That's the gem of old Ireland's crown.
Sweet Rosey McCann
From the banks of the Bann,
She's the Star of the County Down"".
Chorus:
   She'd a soft brown eye
And a look so sly,
And a smile like the rose in June,
And you hung on each note
From her lily-white throat,
As she lilted an Irish tune.
At the pattern dance
You were held in a trance,
As she tripped through a reel or a jig;
And when her eyes she'd roll,
She'd coax, on my soul,
A spud from a hungry pig.
Chorus:

I've traveled a bit,
But I never was hit
Since my roving career began;
But fair and square
I surrendered there
To the charms of young Rose McCann.
I'd a heart to let
And no tenant yet
Though I'd searched countryside and town;
But in she went,
And I asked no rent
From the Star of the county Down.
Chorus:

At the harvest fair
She'll be surely there
So I'll dress in my Sunday clothes.
With my shoes shone bright
And my hat cocked right
For a smile from my nut-brown Rose.
No horse I'll yoke,
No pipe I'll smoke
Though my plough with the rust turn brown,
Till a smiling bride
By my own fire side
Sits the Star of the County Down.
Chorus:  ",Star of the County Down

Jon & Vangelis,"In amongst the rings of confusion
Silencing the thought powers one by one
It seems all so incredible
Our own ability to confuse, to sacrifice
To enlighten like a Shakespearian play
We foolish and happily hold on to sanity
While all around the pushing
And prodding of our feelings
The twisting and turning of our hearts
Displaying an almost indefinable strength
Of purpose, a reason, a reason, a reason
Where no reasons seems to exist

Yet, as in a vision, a voice transcending
All our imagination, jewel of life
Guiding light heralding a joyous new dawn
Clear and gifted time
Divine nature, super nature
The supreme gift of knowledge and space
In this cacophony of life

[Chorus:]
Peace will come
Peace will come
Peace will come
Will come
Peace will come
Peace will come
Peace will come
Will come true horizon
Come true horizon
Come true horizon
Come true horizon

[Chorus]

Peace will come [Repeat x 3]
Will come

Reach for the starlight
Reach when it calls you
You, you are the reason
If you want
You are the answer in the end
La la la's...

Sweet music, and your secret heart
Both have the healing grace
Sweet music, and your secret heart
Both have the healing grace
So again, a change, it comes
Our world desires a way
Touch a child who's lost, afraid,
It lifts you to true emotion
True feelings, be the light
All that is good in this life
Is good, good is good

Oh everlasting dream, oh future come alive
To witness comes that time
I just can't help but believe in life,
All in all I just can't help but believe there is a way
For us to give, a way for us to live
A way for us, a way for us",Horizon

Jon & Vangelis,"If you just take my sense of freedom
If you just take away my home
You can't ever hope to win me
This I'll tell you for sure
There is strength in the common people
For the people is all we really are
Young and old, the wisest and the lowly
Each indeed is 'Holy' in the 'Light of Love'
When the 'Word' comes
I will be waiting
Like a dove that shines he prays for peace
Some have waited what seems a lifetime
Some are waiting now to be released
For the moment we have this freedom
We will choose the way our hearts will move
All the people lost will find their way
Give that chance today
Hear and I will pray
No not for nothing hearts will not be broken
As long as we are open
Our hearts will make us free
Free for the Earth man
Free for the millions
In the 'Glory' all will come to 'Truth'
No aggression, that we leave behind us
To be replaced
By 'You'
For tomorrow another morning
For tomorrow another day
In our children there's that sense of freedom
Help them use it wisely
I will pray",Polonaise
Jon & Vangelis,"Out in the woods we play our songs
And travel through the woodlands together
In the light of heaven
And the silence of the world.
Keeping in touch with the sun
Keeping it for everyone
Latter day dreams that come your way
Will gather in the light
Everything about today just mellows
In the ligght: in your eyes.
I think about silent list
Drowned this summer, travel light
All the deeds and the candlelight
But there is no explaining it
Let the weary come around-one more time-
One more time
Let the weary come one more time around.
I should have guessed that things
Were getting out of hand, the other day
When you told me that you'd gone and left
Your father's ways behind
and you thought that you, couldn't understand him
Well, he didn't really answer the dreams
That you'd planned
So you chased around, all those times,
That come between you, yourself and yourself,
One more time, one more time, one more time
Did you have to think about it, one more time
Put yourself under pressure one more time,
One more time.
Things are looking better now
I heard you say the other day that you knew
So many times I've tried to understand,
We go through
Then again it's the morning light
That can catch my heart aflame
Just the thought of your sweet face
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over and over and over and over again.",One More Time

But not the way that you do.

Will open your heart, your life.
Anyone can light a candle,
But not the way that you do.
For if we look too close,
Pure magic we would be.
Pure magic we would see.
It's all around each one.
It's all around within.
The perfect union,
Close inside your dreams.
To watch in wonderment,
As each day begins.

Jon Allen,"Do you remember you took my hand
And we walked out across the fields
Down the lane and over the railway line
Our hearts were racing our feet were chasing
We were looking for a hide away
Getting lost and losing track of time

We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Where the water ran slow
Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Just laying low
My true love and me

You let your long brown hair hang down
Your summer dress was swaying in the breeze
When we were skimming stones across the stream
You had a lazy style and a carefree smile
You were a breathless beauty to behold
The sweetest sight my eyes had ever seen

We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Where the water ran slow
Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Just laying low
My true love and me

Well waters rise and streams divide
And that river keeps rolling on
Paper boats and pleasure drift away
And you may be just a memory
But you're shinning like a distant star
It seems to me as clear as yesterday

We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Where the water ran slow
Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Just laying low

Many lives we're yet to know
But there's a road that we must follow
And there's still time for us to grow

And though the way just keeps on winding
And every day's a changing view
Down the line I keep on finding
This old road leads me back to you

I have had my share of leaving
I have walked this road alone
Now I hear your voice a calling
I can see the lights of home

And though the way just keeps on winding
And every day's a changing view
Down the line I keep on finding
This old road leads me back to you

I don't need no stars to guide me
I don't need no moonlit sky
Cause I know my heart will take me
Back to where my true love lies

A Diamond in the gutter
A note that's ringing true

Take me to heart and I'll stay
A man like me could love you
So take me to heart I say

Would charge my memory to flight
The trees that listen
Swift wings do carry on through constant
Gardens they offer delight
It is the evening

In deepest woods and fern
Young deer step light through morning's mist
Ascend the swallows
First light streams through the treetops
Bouncing as the flowers illuminate
The breath of morning

Entwined with realities reasoning
I'd sit on the hill side and look out far yonder, imagine I'd easily
Fly away, to where? I don't know
But the imagery caught by my quick imagination would lift me
My spirit to conquer a fall
Well now let me tell you the simplest of stories
We've all been through this moment
And really we've all been through this birth

All praise this glorious chance of life
All praise this wonderous feeling too
All praise this time we all go through
This pain, this light, we bare so fast
Rebirth at last

And I wanted to be by my wife
As she'd labored and given
The child a life, she the purest soul
So I wanted to be by her side
For the very first time I said
For the full and simple reason
Well I wanted it, well yes I did

As a mother and father of innocence
Gladly helping a child to this world
There was more than relief on our minds
It was like touching moments in history
Not just for a memory
With the help of those dear people
Who could have thought for a better
Reason of just wanting to be there
Who could have thought for a better
Reason of just wanting to be there
Who could have thought for a better
Reason of just wanting to be there
For the full and simple reason
Well I wanted it
Wanted it
Wanted to be there

Out in a whispering of time
Can a mother and child love right away
Mother and father as their right accept a reason
As the child's eyes that dream on and dream a life away

And how hopefully wise we become with each passing day

It was a mid-summer night dream long ago
I kinda got me a mood
About me, hit me,
Something was trying to tell me something

When you think about it, but I,
Heard voices calling me saying
Have you heard the good news personified

You realize what we're talking about
About the power of love
Why don't the United Nations
Declare a special night celebration

We're gonna send the weapons up on a starry night
Explode them above the atmosphere, it sounds right
The whole damn world will be watching
The magic mushrooms in the bright sky
Such a night of splendor
What a way to surrender

What a way to surrender
See me off down to grab the colonels and the generals
To write a letter to the heads of the government, government
Asking them to name, the day
If you think anything of anyone
Why don't sit right down and write that letter
Getting rid of that fear the sooner the better
How about this for a mid-summer night dream
A night we all will remember

We're gonna send the weapons up on a starry night
Explode them above the atmosphere,

Jon Anderson,"Hold it there
Try to imagine
Songs of heaven in motion
Singing songs of devotion

But it's easier said than done
Twice as close
Bringers of wisdom
Simply trying to touch
Put a spell on you
Say it's all possible
But it's easier said than done
Think for a reason
It's easy to please
Thoughts of a love world
Where innocence leads you
To a magical high
When someone you remember
Helps by telling you why, why
Why there is worship
Deep, deep within
Not so easily seen
Or amazingly witnessed
A spell on you
It's already said and done
Hold it there
You can imagine
All of heaven in motion
Special songs of devotion
Say it's all possible
But easier said than done
Think of a season
So easy to reach
Thoughts of a good world
Where innocence leads you
To a magical high
When someone you remember
Helps by telling you why, why
Why there is worship
Deep, deep within
Nor so specially seen
Or amazingly witnessed
A spell on you
It's already said and done

Looking at your quick mistakes
So yo you finally went and did it
You screamed and ran away

It was the perfect chance

It's all for beginners
How we knew it then
But that didn't mean a thing

So we stacked our promises
To the mothers of invention
Then yo you chased the spiral dream
With the brothers of time

So you gave your heart of hearts
To the sisters of the union
You were left so high and dry
Just give it up
Just give a little time

Betcha never thought
You'd make
Betcha never thought
You'd see the light of day
Betcha never thought
You'd make it

You were dancing faster all the time
Living life so down and out
But it was so magnificent
You couldn't leave it all alone

So you chased your dreams
When they sing to you, ""Bon jour""
It's the perfect dream
But that didn't mean a thing

Something tells me you know who you are
You just make believe it all
Something tells me you were
Just waiting for that perfect time

See this reality
It's the mother of invention
You can spin the spiral dream
Sister, brother, sister of time

You'd see the light of day

How you throw your love away
You never know how much it hurts
Living without love

I was the one
Who wandered on my own
Looking for some familiar road

I was a diamond man at night
I was a fool that couldn't believe at all
Then I met you once again
And you showed me you can't give
Until you're strong enough to love

How could I begin
With no foundation in my heart

And it wasn't until I saw
My life in your eyes

At last I've found true love
Without someone to love, without someone
There's no reason to live
At last I've found true love
In a lifetime

It's never the same
When your dreams have gone away
A day seems like a year
When your love has disappeared

I'm suddenly more aware of you
N' all the things that I've got to do
I'm yours forever and you're mine
And I just don't want to waste another
Day of time

At last I've found true love
Without someone to love, without someone
There's no reason to live
At last I've found true love
In a lifetime

There was a time, there was a time
I got caught in the middle
Of the darkest night-suddenly
Suddenly I could feel
A power so divine

Oh, don't you ever deny my heart
And all the things love stands for
'Cause there's no way
I could ever find a love so right
Not in any other lifetime
I believe this love's so right

At last I've found true love
Without some to love, without someone
There's no reason to live

Jon Anderson,"I will be here with you

For your love

All thoughts need someone, too.

Some kind of beautiful stranger
You could be good for me

If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Heaven forbid
I'll take my chance on a beautiful stranger

I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song

To love you
Is to be part of you
I paid for you with my tears

There's dust In all their hearts

Jon Auer,"It's just coincidence
Well you can talk that way, but i have to say,
I don't beleive in it
It was the chill of chance, i decided to dance the days away
And i wasn't worried at all
Sneaking through the back door
No, I wasn't worried at all
Dreams are what you live for

Waiting for the light to turn green
Carry me home
To the kindest eyes that i've ever seen
Carry me home
Well can you tell me how will it be now
how will it be
Can you tell me how will it be now
How will it be?

well we were younger then
And the days were long and slow
But were we wiser then?
I couldn't say, I wouldn't know
But i wasn't worried at all
i had someone to run to
And i wasn't worried at all
I knew which way the wind blew

Counting out the chaos in bloom
Carry me home
And I watched the sinners spin round the room
Carry me home
Well can you tell me how will it be now
how will it be
Can you tell me how will it be now
How will it be?

In a cold world
How will it be?
In the real world
How will it be?
In a lonely world
How will it be?
Will the ghosts just stop
Following me
All now drawn into the sun
He was the only one
In the real world
How will it be?
In a cold cold world
How will it be?
Beck and call
Beg and crawl
How will it be?
Will the ghosts just stop
Following me
All now drawn into the sun
He was the only one

And so, i remember you
I remember the days and the thousands of ways you pulled me through
And dreamed of all the things you've seen
Of all the faces and all of the places you have been
And now you have no phone and you have no name and you have no number
And it comes to the end in the blink of an eye and it makes me wonder",Tears

Black limosines they gather round
Our stance, our secret romance (We are having)
Nobody knows your with me
Cause you're a stranger to that world within me
So you said so softly on the stranger's bed

No I could never imagine your lips being that red
The smell of wine is on your breath
I trip out when I think of the things we did
I wish I never, I wish I never did

Feeling so bad and sober
I don't care cause you're not there
(You1re not there)
Feeling the fire within me
The pulse of last night's heart beat
Still echoes within me
I can feel your skin

No I could never imagine a love affair like this
So secretive when we're both kissing
When I'm with you baby
'Cause you're a special lady

Where we can get it on good, baby
As far away, baby
From the world and all the city lights

About your man at home
Just me and you alone

Jon B.,"Love's golden band
Little hands that have gripped a thousand years
You thought he was the only man
As he left you in your December tears
He don't deserve
A woman like you
A man like me
Needs to show you
What real love is supposed to be
Funny how the days of new
Keep speeding up
But the night of old
Seem like they're slowing down
But don't you cry
To save the truth
From coming out
With words that let him go
I guarantee he won't be back around

Chorus:
Love don't do
What he did to you
Don't you know love was made for two

Love don't do
What he did to you
Love don't leave you in the cold
Maybe the tale you've not been told
Story of all he did to you
Love don't do

Come in from the rain
Outside take off your coat
Come over here by the fireplace
I know baby, I know it feels so bad
When someone you love
Comes and leaves your side
Strange what desire
Can make people do
Following foolish pride
They say you don1t really love somebody
'Til you love them enough to let them go
Seems these cliches had a reason to be made
His love came a lifetime too late
You had to let him know

You are down and baby

Jon B.,"So I guess tonight kinda had that flow
I head you say ""go for what you knnow""
So I took upon the thought of meating you at 12:00
For a private little rendezvous
At first I didn't catch your name
Curiosity causing me pain
And the only thing to do
Is to get to know you better
With you timid little easy sway

If love stains my mind
With the ebony you
And these words seem like lines
Let the truth cut through
'Cause I fantisize reality with you
Open my eyes for the mystery of me and you

Chorus:
Ooh me and you
Mystery 4 two
Ooh me and you

I guess the night kinda had that flow
Mr. Moon in the sky hung low
And I saw your face
Pretty dressed in lace
And I didn't know what to say
Honey baby you just stood there
Just kicking with that stare
And I stood fighting with my instincts
But the fight is not fair

If love stains my mind with the vision of you
Please rewind it, make this moment be true
'Cause I can1t stop thinking about you, oh
The myterious you

We can make love under the stars
Baby it doesn't mater where we are
Honey me and you, we can make it through

Jon B.,"There's many tears and sad love songs
For all those who lost to love (yes)
Nobody seems to know why we do what we do
To each other when the times get rough (yes)
I thought that love was plain and simple
But oh what a lie
I've been counting on the one that I love
It's not that love breaks your heart
You know love don't love nobody
I guess the level that loved was too much

Chorus:
Ooh, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow
Noo, I didn't know
Not to let my love overflow

You see there's not many ways around the mountain
For all those who choose to climb
Sometimes it feels like no matter how far I get
The distance is all up to time
See I gave my love my only faith
But oh what a shame
I felt wealthy with my bag of fools' gold
And there's a point when you know
That love's off the tracks
When the train stops 'cause the engine's too cold
(Chorus)

Don't want to say I lost my faith in love
No, I don't want to say I've given up on my dreams
I believe in everlasting love, yes I do
Just give it to me, what I want
‘Cause it1s only you

Hold up, let me make love to you, baby
Hold up, let me take my pants off, baby
Hold up, let you be real with me, baby

Acting like way back when
We were just beside ourselves
With love, touching your lovely skin
Remembering feeling within
To rush the moment could be so hasty
When you taste me
(Chorus)

Exploring the most within
If we're in love then is it sin
Pushing my thoughts into your dreams
You know what I mean
Pouring our body melts
And in the morning tell me how it felt
Hope it's just as good for you
As you are to me

Me want to love you and know you, baby
Me want to get it up for you
Me want to take my pants off, baby

Convince a girl like you
To be his lover and one and only
How can I make you see
That I'm the one for you
And nobody does it like me

Hey pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?

Hey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight
I'll make you calm through the night
Your legs around my waist so tight
I'll slide down south to taste you right
You taste so good to me
How does a man like me
Seduce a girl like you
How can I make you my one and only 
How can I make you scream
There's no one else for you
'And nobody does it like me, baby

There's a candle that's burning in my heart tonight
And the flame is full of my desire
And I can't help but desire you in my bed tonight
And I'll touch you in the places
Where no one's been before
And I'll kiss you in the places
Where men sometimes ignore
And I'll take you to a level
You've never felt before
And though you won't understand it
You'll cry and ask for more

Since I've been by your side
And you spend all your time
Knowing what you've done for me
The simple fact is
That I'm longing for you, girl
Desperate and needing you to stay in my life

'Cause I'm sorry but forgiving

I wish I could satisfy you baby
But you're so sick of the those natural things
Guess I'm a fool for loving you

Time after time again

I used to be such a baby
Crying in your arms
But now I'm older, wiser
Now I'm hip to the scene
Tell me, when you make love to that someone else
Do you think of how it felt
Different with me when you feel asleep?
When you wake up, I was there

I was honest
I was changed for the good
But the bad of it all
Is it's worth nothing, nothing to you
I wonder if after it all
Is there someone still waiting for me
Is this all in the plan for the helping hand
I wish it would be you
But I know it can1t
(Chorus)

You gave your reasons why
You made perfect sense
But you'll miss your water
When your well runs dry

I was the one
You'll have your fun
In the back of your mind
You'll find that you still love me

He don't take his time
All in a daze someone else must be on his mind

Is it worth it girl I know it's gettin' old to you
He's givin' dough to you

Took a good look at my face

Is I'm just a man trying to find his way

But at least I got you to hold
And I've become the man I am
'Cause all our troubles made me understand
It's been all of our lives

All of our lives I want to stay this way
Our Lord knows we're gonna make mistakes
But I'll give up everything to make it through
And all our lives ain't been the easiest time
And Lord knows it's been an up hill climb
But I'll do it all again to be with you

Ever since we went through with the plan
I'm feeling like I've become a better man
'Cause I'm giving up that part of me
That held me back from being free

I'm putting back the pieces others stole
And now nobody can hurt
My baby cause we make it work

I can't hold the rain back when it starts to storms

You don't have to fight your feelings anymore
(We can learn from the pain)

Just till you think girl, you'll be alright

All pressed on you

And that's alright
Pardon me, I'mma back up and be a gentleman
And if it's really real then you can tell me when
And that's when she pulled me close and said ""Do it again"", come on

She felt like something I'd never forget 
Something you had to witness 
Perfect physical fitness alerted all my 5 senses

Keep it tight when I'm in it ask me how does it feel

Jon B.,"So he started out takin' you out
Doin' what any man would do
Sayin' any and everything to just get wit you
I can't say I blame him for a girl as fine as you

So he played you out, ain't no doubt
He was runnin' game on you
After all the fun he was through with you
Any way that it goes down girl, he's the one that's gonna lose

Don't cry lonely girl
If you need somebody girl
I know you feel deserted
And you can't find your way back home
I will show you girl
The way that love should feel
You ain't suppose to be hurtin'
And you don't have to be alone

It was hard enough, growing up
Being as beautiful as you
Trying to save your love for the one that's true
It's not always so easy to know what's right to do

It's your first mistake, you can't make
Make someone be down with you
Why do you even take the time out to call that fool
When you know deep in your heart that he don't care 'bout you

Oh you can dry your eyes
Pick yourself up and say bye bye
(Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)

And I can't even seem to eat
I haven't got a good sleep since the other day
When you went away

Cause you can't seem to let yourself just bounce back

Am I suppose to stick around
And I know I also say hurtful things
Like I don't want you no more
But the truth is I don't know where to go if I walk through that door

And this time
It hurt my soul so bad
Cause I can't let myself just bounce right back

The more that I feel inside

But the pleasure was mine

To love a woman properly sprung
We committed so I hit it

Part 2
This is for all the homeboys who couldn't get their happy home
As long as one of us got it some of us got it
Stay down for me, hold on

Verse 1:
Sometimes you made me feel like I wasn't good enough for you
So I punished us both and didn't stay true
So much pain I know I've caused you
Truly I'm sorry every day that I'm away girl
Things went down that just don't make sense
Time and place is all now irrevelant
Cause I'm still thinking about the love that's gone
Morning, cooking breakfast back at home

Chorus:
I never meant for this to end
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember my happy home, home, home

2Pac:
Goin' through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest, it's a hard role just to keep up your faith in God
Knowing you'll get scared though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's momma, made her my wife now
I'm tryin' hard y'all, maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watching older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it'll help our child grow then together we die
Why question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I wonder what you must feel like now you know
That I'm having a seed with someone else
I didn't plan it to be this way
But things happen with time
And you know, time don't wait for nobody baby Oh, now I gotta handle my responsibility
Even though you still mean so much to me
Baby I can't say enough that I'm sorry
Oh, I never meant

Now This time we gon' get away
'Cause I'm stronger than I've ever been, eh!
Where I am is no longer where I've been ..oh
Now, look at me, I'm stronger than I've ever been,
Ooh ooh ooh ah!
I'm stronger and it's all
All because of you
All because of you! I'm stronger

But I'm stronger!
I'm still missing pieces after everything
But I'm stronger! 
Can't believe it 'cause she said she'd never leave
But I'm stronger!
But if she'd never left, I would have never seen
That I'm stronger!
You made me, you made me stronger! (You made me)
Strong, strong, strong! Oh, oh, oh stronger!",Stronger Everyday

Jon B.,"I can't deny the fact that I spend my time with you
But lately even little shit got me losin' my grip and
There's something we gotta do
Now either you stop going through my pockets late 
At night getting caught up in what you might find
Baby I got love for you but I'ma have 
To fall back even though you usually spend the night

[Chorus:]
What in the world 
What in the world are we doing?
Spending so much time?
What is it girl
What in the world are we doing?
I guess all I know is that
It's a beautiful thing but
What in the world are we doing?

Sometimes you got me feeling like I got a personal angel
But I've learned from the past to keep my expectations low
'Cause don't you know what it feels like when you put
All your faith in someone and they bounce
Then you know what you know about love

Baby we need to take precautions (Baby we need to take precautions)
Things are heating up
So fast emotions the time it takes to get to where
We are such a short time it seems but what a 
Long time indeed. It's been a minute which ya baby

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
Oh so sexy you got that natural

So amazing I'm getting faded
Off you so intoxicating

Pretty feet with open toes
Scent of your neck is like a fresh red rose
X-ray vision passing through your clothes
But I really cant wait to see you naked though
The way your body move and you dip it slow
I try to play it cool but I gotta let you know
The way you looking I can tell you wanna go
Skip the preview and lets get to the show

My baby she kick it, she cool with all the fellas, she hood
Like taking chances but classy like Cinderella
She down like four flats, my baby girl is real, 
She done weathered the storm and baby down with you still

[Chorus]

Now we at home and were all alone
With no interruptions just turn off you phone
Daddy's little girl but now that your all grown
Birthday suit is all you got on
Got the radio on and its playing your song
Touching on your body all night long
Feels so right that it cant be wrong
Sexual healing coming on strong

Them curves like a coke bottle cant be beat
Pedicure every week on them cute little feet
She a freak under the covers but she keep it discrete
She's my midnight treat baby for real that's why I remain

[Chorus]

She shaped like an hour glass
Flier than a mockingbird
Baby got that smooth skin softer than some fox fur
We go together like sweaters in cold weather
Nobody can do it better baby down for whatever
She gangsta like lil' Kim sexy like Alicia Keys
Funny like smoore baby cooler than a summer breeze
Man I swear my baby cuter than a teddy bear, nobody compares
Lil' mama baby that's why I am your man

Jon Ballantyne,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

We're secretly out of control, nobody knows it

Jon Bellion,"Bring me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's only smiling 'cause my soul is flying
I did everything for New York

New Yorker in California, packed Brooklyn up in this bag
I'm in Malibu with the Bronx, she's in Kevin love with your man
Kyrie needed a king, I'm just making you understand
What I rustle up in the West, 'cause my reach is Kevin Durant
Records are very pop with a pocket deeper than sand
A juxtaposition, Sam Cooke, Billy Joel, Steely Dan
Changing the fucking spectrum, I need you to understand
Like I took the fall for some drugs, I've been nominated for Grams (It's Grammy's)
Skinny genius got blueprints up in my hand
So the minute you hear my single, just know that it's in my plan
Advantage of demographics, I'm Jigga, Bruno and Sam Smith
I'm moving business, I'm Taylor Swift in a van
This game, boy, is very, very advanced
I'm very, very New York, be very, very aware
How very, very De Niro I can get on a snare
Letting go of your throat, I can sing the hook if you scared

Bring me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's only smiling 'cause my soul is flying
I did everything for New York

Meet me in the red dress when the stakes side, that's porterhouse
She's 5 foot 9 in a Rolls Royce, that's Slaughterhouse
Benny Hahn, Hahn's and a tall boy, we ordered out
The hell you need a chaser when all this liquor is watered down
Wait, see all them lines is fuck boy chat
Don't be so impressed by all that fuck boy rap
This money gon' leave you empty if you just want that
See, my joy lies in the son and you should jump on that
She'll make you think that she the wife and that you found the one
But she just looking for some powder, not the talcum one
I’m not judging, here in the middle like I’m Malcolm, son
Verbal trigger like you should never play around with guns
Bow down to no crown, these goobers out for the count
'Cause the Sour Diesel was loud, I was pounding face in the lounge
Sober dope, moving proud, like allowance found in the crowd
With a thousand counting me out, but I'm here and killing the crowd now, blow

Bring me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's only smiling 'cause my soul is flying
I did everything for New York

Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you

Let me give the kids just a little help
Tell 'em money is not the key to wealth
'Cause if it can stop the pain
How the fuck did you explain the bunch of millionaires that killed themselves?
So you can take me off your winner's shelf
I got different vision, I'm bringing help
I know the demons in the room gon' say it's more that I can chew
But now all I hear is the dinner bell
I need a family that loves me right
Don't need a chain, don't need a club at night
I had a conversation with an angel
She told me I'd cheat death if I stayed away from the party life
Dropped off in the land where the artists play
Where God's way is the hardest way
Told myself I'm keeping my faith
If it costs me my reputation, then take it, I'll give it all away","New York Soul, Pt. 2"
Jon Bellion,"Yeah, I think I got one
Her soul is presidential like Barack, son
Yeah, she call me Goose, I call her Maverick 'cause of Top Gun
They say we annoying, they just jealous cause we got love
Yeah, I got a hot one
She don't want a problem if there's not one
But people come around and try some stupid shit to start one
She give you the people's fuckin' elbow like The Rock, son

There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so

Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me

""Hey, do I impress you?""
I really like the way you rock a sweatsuit
When you working out and I'm just watching how your legs move
They would think that you was, like, developed in a test tube
You deserve a theme song
You could be the shoulder that I lean on
Love it when you're late for work and try to slip your jeans on
You be bumping Chili Peppers all up in your Nissan

There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive

Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me

You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew

Jon Bellion,"We're six feet underground inside my bed
And all the little letters in my head
We're spelling suicide but not by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

Only the sound of my back breaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

The only friend I had wore black and red
The darker instruments inside my head
We're playing suicide but not by choice, by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

Only the sound of my hands shaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

Don't hold the weight of the world
I don't hold the weight, I don't hold the weight

This the flow that helped me tip the scale
I'm stackin' chips like Chippendale's without the strippin'
Get the bailiff out 'cause Mr. Bellion's out the cell
We skip the bail and out the jail
We hit the trail, the route we took is hard to smell it out
So get to sniffin', equipped with the gift of spit like the lisp on the chick who played in the flick next to Spiderman
I'm brighter than LEDs on your TV
Keyz is sharp as a dagger
Who walks around with a swagger of Kenny G
When you see me, chill with the chatter
Got the skill of a master craftsman whose passion is rappin'
Snackin' on actors, so pass me a napkin
Chip on the shoulder, the kid is colder than both Dakotas
The winter soldier, assassin coming after your captain
For honor and every day, I'm getting stronger
No one will shock the world, got a buzz like a mini Blanka
When they apply the pressure, it's heavier than E. Honda
Got what it takes to be great, but can't hold this weight any longer",Weight of the World

Jon Bon Jovi,"I wake up in the morning
And I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm going
Only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
A six gun lover
A candle in the wind

When you're brought into this world
They say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel
Mister catch me if you can

I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun

You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
Well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
And I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun

Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favor
And hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let this boy die like a man
Staring down a bullet
Let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory

But I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son

Jon Bon Jovi,"Hey Patty Garrett that's what I used to call you
They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver
They paid you some money to sell them my blood

But you say, this ain't about me and this ain't about you
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed
You do what you've gotta cause you can't walk away

Wonder what would of have happened if you were the killer and I was the hero
Would things be the same ?
Or would I have traded your life for my own life ?
Would I have paid your debts in your place ?
I don't know

But this ain't about me and this ain't about you
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed
You do what you've gotta cause you can't walk away

And tells me not to cry
While a full moon says a prayer for me
I try to close my eyes

Of the guns and the early graves
The ghosts appear as I fall asleep
To sing an outlaw's serenade

[Chorus:]
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'
When you're livin' on the run
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness
For the things that I have done
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
The desert's been a friend to me
It covers me by night
And a snakebite's not my enemy
But it taught me how to fight
All this fame don't bring you freedom
Though it wears a this disguise
When an outlaw is just a man to me
And a man has to die

And I hope someone will pray for me
When it's my turn to die... pray for me

I'm a loner on the run
I'm just looking for tomorrow
And I ain't gonna hurt no one

I jumped headfirst into a bottle
I was lookin' for a friend
Came up just short of nothin'
I didn't find the truth, I only found an end

So tell me who's gonna save me
Or my father or my son?
When the only justice a man can see
Is the barrel of a loaded gun, oh yeah

I been broke and I've been hungry
I think they're both my middle name
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough
Still I guess, I can't complain

'Cause what you get in life you take it
You've gotta hold on and make it last
They say good things come to those who wait
But it's life that goes so fast

And when there's just one rule you live by
Each day you kiss the risin' sun
When you live and die by the life we breathe
In the barrel of a loaded gun

Guns talk to me in my sleep at night
And a gun somewhere is burnin'
With my name

Winners are losers
And losers will have to face
All those yesterdays
And all of the dreams they blew away

So Mister can you help me
Or are you my gun?
Have the ghosts of justice
Brought you here to me to taste

There's justice in the barrel of a loaded gun
Justice in the barrel of a loaded gun
Justice in the barrel of a loaded gun

Jon Bon Jovi,"A penny for your thoughts now baby
Looks like the weight of the world's on your shoulders now
I know you think you're going crazy
Just when it seems everything's gonna work itself out
They drive you right back down

And you said it ain't fair
That a man walks
When a bird can fly
We have to kick the ground
The stars kiss the sky
They say that spirits live
A man has to die
They promised us truth
Now they're giving us lies

Gonna take a miracle top save us this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause it's all on the line
And I won't let you down
(No I won't let you down, ooh...)
The river of your hope is flooding
And I know the dam is busted
If you need me I'll come running
I won't let you down... no, no

You're looking for salvation
You thought that it'd be shining like an angel's light, yeah
Well, the angels left this nation
And salvation caught the last train out tonight
He lost a hell of a fight

He said: ""I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be
I never can be everything you wanted from me
I've got big plans so big that any blind man could see
I'm standing in the river
Now I'm drowning in the sea""

Gonna take a miracle top save us this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause your heart's on the line
And your heartbeat is slowing down (heartbeat's blowing, ooh...)
Your feet are grounded still you're reaching for the sky
You can let 'em clip your wings 'cause I believe that you can fly

Well my eyes have seen the horror of the coming of the flood
I've driven deep the thorny crown into the soul of someone's son
Still I'll look you in the eye 'cause I've believed in things I've thought
And I'll die without regret for the wars I have fought

Gonna take a miracle top save you this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause your heart's doing time
And your conscience is calling you out (conscience's calling, ooh...)
It ain't all for nothing
Life ain't written in the sand
I know the tide is coming
But it's time we made a stand with a miracle

Gonna take a miracle, I need a miracle
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
Na, miracle (miracle) oh...",Miracle

And younger than the boys (that's right)

That blows on a hot august night

And you were lonesome
As a jukebox
But deadly just the same
I could be as gentle as a newborn
Then spit into the eye of a hurricane

And we knew how to laugh
And we knew how to cry
Yeah, we sure knew how to live
But we don't ever

Never say die

I guess you'd say we had a pact
These words we knew so well (that's right)
Still they remained unspoken
And we'd take them to the fiery
Gates of hell

Once i was afraid of love
But when it's your brother
Those things change
'cause love is just another word
For trust
So hear me when i say

Never say die
Never say no
You got to look them in the eye

That it's the strong who survive

As i kiss this world goodbye

With no illusions
That only one of you is going home again

A good man evil
It's this world that can drive a 
Good man mad
And it's this world that turns a killer 
Into a hero

When I close the book
On the hearts I broke
And the lives I took
Will he walk away
'Cause my soul's
Too late to save

The way they always do 
As they raced home from the mailbox 
A mother and her son 
Against a little girl of 6 years old 
The independent one 

The deputies went door to door 
Through all the neighborhood 
They said I got some news to tell you folks 
I'm afraid it ain't so good 
Somehow something happened 
Someone got away 
Someone got the answers for what happened here today 
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no 

Tell me it was just a dream, August 7 4:15 
God closed His eyes and the world got mean 
August 7 4:15 

Now the people from the papers and the local T.V. news 
Tried to find the reason 
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues 
Someone shouted ""Hit and Run"" 
The coroner cried ""Foul"" 
Her blue dress was what she wore 
The day they laid her body down 
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no, no, no, no 

Tell me it was just a dream, August 7 4:15 
God closed His eyes and the world got mean 
August 7 4:15 

I know tonight that there's an angel 
Up on Heaven's highest hill 
And no one there can hurt you baby 
No one ever will 
Somewhere someone's conscience is like a burning bed 
The flames are all around you 
How you gonna sleep again 

Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no 

Tell me it was just a dream, August 7 4:15 
God closed His eyes and the world got mean 
August 7 4:15",August 7
Jon Bon Jovi,"You said you loved to watch me sleep 
You put your head down on my chest 
To hear me breathe

Go on, take my last breath from me 
I don't want to live no more 
And cut my eyes so I can't see 
I can't see you looking back as you walk out the door 

Chorus: 
Cold, hard heart 
Cold, cruel heart 
What's it gonna take 
To break your cold,hard heart 

I was a lover lost in sea 
You found me washed up on the beach 
You took me home,you gave me breakfast 
I said I'd offer you protection, but you didn't charge a fee

Cold, hard heart 
Cold, cruel heart 
What's it gonna take 
To break your cold,hard heart 

Cold, cold heart

What's it gonna take 
To break your cold,hard heart 

What are you hiding underneath that shirt 
If you're the one to run babe 
Then you don't feel the hurt 

Her hair so brown, and eyes so green 
You used to say I made good company 
She'd bring me wine and sip her tea 
Then you'd give yourself what you could give to me

Cold, hard heart 
Cold, cruel heart 
What's it gonna take

Your cruel heart

Jon Bon Jovi,"Hey babe, it's me parked outside your house
I know that he's asleep, so listen to me now
Darlin', I'm tired of living just in your dreams
I'm getting out
You know we both sold our souls
We're just growing old in this sleepy, dead-end town

Destination anywhere - Name the place, I'll be there
Pack a bag and we're out of here - let's run

Baby, we both been running uphill for too long
We both settled for something, got nothing
And we both know that it's wrong
Go on admit it if we lived it
I'm leaving, get your boots and come on
I've got my coat and my keys
I need you next to me then I'm gone, come on

Destination anywhere - Name the place and I'll be there
Pack a bag and we're out of here - let's run
Destination anywhere - Left or right, I don't care
Baby we'll just disappear like the sun, ooh

When these wheels spin, baby they can all eat our dust
As far as I'm concerned, this whole town lost its nuts
We won't be here when they put us down
It's our big chance, I'm calling you now
They'll never let us go unless we try
I'm tired of living just to die
We're getting out of here, destination anywhere

Destination anywhere - Name the place and I'll be there
Pack a bag and we're out of here - let's run
Destination anywhere - Left or right, I don't care
Maybe we'll just disappear chase the sun
Come on, come on, come on

Jon Bon Jovi,"I've been staring at the page for what seems like days 
I guess I put this one off for a while 
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes? 
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried? 
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you (hey now) 
Hey now, I guess the night's just bringing me down 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 

You've been the blood in my veins 
The only one who knows my middle name 
And the smiles, they came easy 'cause of you (hey now) 
You know that I love you, but I hate you 
'Cause I know I can never escape you 
So let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark (hey now) 
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud? 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 
Have I said too much 
Maybe I haven't said enough 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 

Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch 
Maybe I've lost my guts 
There, is that truth enough? 
Hey now, hey now... 

[Guitar solo]

You know these love letters mix with whisky 
Just don't light a match when you kiss me 
Though I'll blow away, you know I'll be back soon (hey now) 
Hey now, hey now, hey now, am I talking just a little too loud? 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 
Have I said too much 
Maybe I haven't said enough 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart 
Hey now, am I talking just a little too proud? 
Hey now, the night's just bringing me down",Every Word Was a Piece of My Heart
Jon Bon Jovi,"You know your favorite old pair of shoes
The ones with the hole in the toe you won't lose
Your favorite record that's all scratched and used
But still you love to play when your feeling blue

That faded rose that's all dried out
Those Bukowski poems we couldn't live without
Your high school picture when you had wild hair
That stormy day on the beach that got us here

Oh, you better believe there's just one thing you need
Oh can't you see?

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
If there's just one thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams, it's just me baby

Just like a shadow 10 feet tall
Standin' right behind you should you fall
I'll be the one to hold you up to walk
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl

And if your waves should ever break at sea
I'll be there waitin, I'm that sandy beach
I'm that same old dog, scratchin' those same fleas
I'll be by your side, you can count on me

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
If there's just one thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
What's it gonna take to make you see
What's it gonna take 'til you believe in me

Oh, how my smile fades and my heart just breaks
Every time you go away

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
If there's one more thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
What's it gonna take to make you see
What's it gonna take 'til you believe in me

And if someday some new memory comes along
Lookin' shiny new, feelin' really strong
You can tell him that I'll tell him, he can just move on
I'm a fighter, I've been fightin' for you all night long

It's just me baby
It's just me
It's just me baby
It's just me

Jon Bon Jovi,"Sitting here just watching you sleep 
Wish I could slip inside and be 
In some technicolor dream 
But the air's too thick for one of us to breathe 
I'm not fool enough to think 
You couldn't live life without me 

I didn't come this far to throw the towel in 
I didn't fight this hard to walk away 
If I ain't smart enough to say I'm sorry 
It's just because the words got in the way 

I remember how it used to be 
I was you and you were me 
We were more than just the same 
Now these shoes don't fit, my skin's too tight 
When you want a kiss, I take a bite 
Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights 

Last night I drank enough to drown 
Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health 
Look, we both know how much I've let you down 
Janie don't you take your love to town 

Janie don't you take your love to town 
Janie don't you take your love to town 
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away 
Janie don't you take your love to town 

You deserve a shooter, a saint 
Someone to give it to you straight 
To find the soul thought flesh and bone 
My life's a treasure, full of sunny weather 
But it's left me feeling cold 
Now all you want to do is take me home 

I hated you, the night you said you loved me 
I hated you, 'cause I couldn't love myself 
I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me 
I got one foot in, one foot off the ground 

Janie don't you take your love to town 
Janie don't you take your love to town 
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away 
Janie don't you take your love to town 

Sitting here while you're fast asleep 
In the bathroom by the sink 
Trying to write the right words down 
I turn out the lights, close my eyes 
There ain't no prayers or kiss goodnight 
What I'll forget to say tomorrow, I'll say now 
Janie don't you take your love to town 

Janie don't you take your love to town 
Janie don't you take your love to town 
If I've got to beg, I'll beg, just don't walk away

Jon Bon Jovi,"I got my call light on 
Gimme one more fare tonight 
Just get me over the bridge 
I can see those shiny bay lights 
You know I'm never alone 
But I'm feeling lonely tonight 
Damn, I got my last cigarette 
But I ain't got not light 

God let these wheels roll 
To where the girls are pretty 
When the nights explode 
And life is still living 
Down this open road 
The arms of pity 
Wait to greet me tonight in little city 

In my rear view mirror 
I see someone else's hairline 
I hear that fire in your eyes 
Is on the rock and doing hard time 

And the grapes of wrath, they're on the vine 
There's wine in this dirt 
Here love ain't love 
It's just another four letter word 

God let these wheels roll 
To where the girls are pretty 
When the nights explode 
And life is still living 
Down this open road 
The arms of pity 
Wait to greet me tonight in little city 

Now that cold gray fog's 
Just a rolling down the highway 
He's come to carry me home 
It's put a little smile on my face",Little City
Jon Bon Jovi,"The kids 'round here look just like sticks
They trade old licks with a beat up six
I just smile and catch the groove

Gothic girls all dress in black
Serious as heart attacks
It takes a little bit of getting used to

The old man with the whiskey stains
Lost the night forgot his name
His poor wife will sleep alone again
And it ain't hard to understand
Why she's holding on to her own hand

Chorus:
It's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's asking me for favors
No one's looking for a savoir
They're too busy saving me

(repeat chorus)
I've seen a lone,sloane ranger drive
Seems her chauffeur took a dive
And sold her secrets to the sun
And later in a magazine
I finally figured what it means
To be a saint, not a queen

Two lustful lovers catch a spark
And chase their shadows in the dark
Someone's getting off tonight
Of a big red bus that's packed so tight
It disappears in a trail of light
Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right...

Chorus:
It's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's asking me for favors
No one's looking for a savoir
They're too busy saving me
Midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's pinned dreams on me
No one's asking me to bleed
I'm the man i want to be
When chelsea girls sing...

It's morning when i go to sleep
In the distant dawn a church bell rings
Another day is coming on
A baby's born, an old man dies
Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye
I leave my soul and just move on
And wish that i was there to sing this song

Chorus:
It's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
No one's asking me for favors
No one's looking for a savoir

Jon Bon Jovi,"My friend had a girlfriend 
She liked her drink 
Sucked the head off her lagger 
Threw me a wink 
And she said to me ""buddy, what's your sign?"" 

I was off I was runnin' 
Knocked me clean off my feet 
Her tongue kept on selling 
What any blind man could see 
I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs 

She said ""what you hiding underneath that shirt?"" 
Right behing the buttons there's a heart that hurts

Naked, face it, you can't fake it when you're naked 
Naked, face it

Put the k back in kink 
Threw a coin in her jukebox 
I started to think 
She just smiled and offered me a peace sign 

How far you gonna run in those designer shoes 
The soul with holes ain't gonna be the one you lose 
I don't know which one is worse

When I put my hands in her cookie jar

It appears that you might be
A little dead to the world
Or at least a bit to all of those

You make a mess of those
Who will care without exception
As you pile drive through anything that stands
In your way or blocks your view

Are you dead to the world?

I've gotta wonder if you are
A little dead to the world
With a reflex that is uncontrolled
It's the only explanation

Jon Brion,"Her ghost is six or so feet tall
And the lights in the house are dim
His voice still echoes through the hall
She can't get away from him

I clear the couch off and I sit
She hangs up the phone and then
She says she can't believe he quit
But I know he'll be back again

Every hour on the hour
He will reappear and make it clear that he's around
It's not your average social call
He does it all without a sound

Her ghost is propped up in the hall
He speaks no evil there
He doesn't notice me at all
I find it a bit unfair

I'm bathed in shadow from that wall
I know he'll be in the air

Every hour on the hour
She'll watch her apparition stare her down, but pass her by
And I've no ammunition 
I'm the one who's being exorcised

Every hour on the hour
Every moment all my power
And every where I turn 
I tend to learn that she's got 
Memories that never burn

And this is of concern and I prepare to go 
'Cause this I know 
That though he's out of sight 
He's in her mind and in my hair
I'm tiring of this fight
Besides it's getting me nowhere

He does it breathlessly
So long as he's the life in her
He'll be the death of me",Her Ghost

Although we've barely met
I can recognize her
From the treatment that I get

So it's my duty to advise her
If she breaks the rules
I've said I'll quit though
I'll admit that hasn't happened yet

I believe she's lying

I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time

As sure as she is sitting here
She's sure that she's awake
And as soon as we're committing
We're admitting our mistake

So of course it's only fitting
That the course we're going to take
Is drawn and whereupon I'm slamming on the brakes

I believe she's lying

I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time

The element of chance
And the subject now in question
Is the same old song and dance

And the time that we invest in
Setting traps out in advance
So we could spend the weekend staring in a trance

I came to meet you, my car died in your yard
Why turn the key?
There's so much here to see
These are my memories

Of precious places, precious things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together

Old hinges squeaking in the rain
That hotel by the highway where we stayed
There's something every hour
Who needs the Eiffel Tower
When we've got memories

Of precious places, precious things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together

The pen, the car
The paint, the pier
The moon and star
The message clear
Liberty raised her hand to us
As if to say, ''It's OK, live today, live today''

I said, ''Don't leave me, don't break the tie''
Then I left you and the time went rolling by
And here's what I can't stand
I know that every landmark 
Triggers memories
Of stupid places and silly things
That were meaningless before

And I seldom get carried away
No you don't have the pull that you used to
But you can still ruin my day
Oh you can still ruin my day

Love, it was nothing 
It hardly hurt a bit

Sounds good to me but unfortunately I remember it
Now I don't lose my place like I used to
I'm not moved by your ? display
No you can't draw me in like you used to
But you can still ruin my day
You can still ruin my day
You can still ruin my day

You can still ruin my day
I said you can still ruin my day",Ruin My Day
Jon Brion,"I got tired, I killed it through and through
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
The same mistakes with you

I didn't lie, but I withheld the truth
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
The same mistakes with you

The line is thin between a selfish act
And things you do to keep yourself intact
I could name a few

I did a lot that I could not undo
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
The same mistakes with you",Same Mistakes
Jon Brion,"Here's the face of trouble
It's the face I wear
And it may invite you in
But I won't go there

Here's a working model
That generates despair
And this baby cranks it out
And it will take you out
And I won't care

It's a beauty

It's the mark of someone
Who's beyond repair
He'll refuse to help himself
Thinking only of himself
And though he isn't by himself
Well it's your job now

There's a conversation
We're about to have
And it's full of twists and turns
Half truths and vague concerns
From one who never learns
To one who never learns
And I never learn

Here's the face of trouble
",Trouble
