Kool G Rap,"I run rappers like races, cut them like razors
Burn them like lasers, and stun them like phasers
Cause my brain thinks and it blanks your memory banks
Sharp as shanks and poetry is like a cleat hanks
Give me a pen, a typa-writer then
I'll cut your whole posse into gingerbread men
With diction sparked from friction
Plenty of dope like the pope cause it's a G Rap prediction
Tower going outer space, louder bass
Replaces the weak rap race
Ashes to ashes, flashes of smashes and crashes
Another big man bashes
Fright, it's a silent night but it's a violent fight
My talent might explode like dynamite
Lyrics blast out, all evil will cast out
Fast and at last all rappers passed out
Wax the vocal tracks all out like whistles
Clear like crystals, loud like pistols
Here to get it straight for the '89 era
This is a killer G
In a trilogy of terror

Uh
Yeah

Lightning and thunder, rappers going six feet under
Kool G Rap makes you wonder
No blunders or mistakes, this takes hard concentration
Effort, for the method, meditation
Visions of light, collisons, tight decisions
Suckers'll end like divisions
Listen I'm like a seed from a demon, a blessing from an angel
Way more mysterious than Bermuda's Triangle
Riddle fit to hit, put together bit by bit
Like a do-it-yourself kit
Then I'll hold your soul on a remote control
So-called MC's will freeze so cold
Then get viewed and examined in a test tube
If you're a square, you freeze into an ice cube
Talent switches, words to riches
You get stitches, rhymes are wicked like witches
Horror, terror, pain, rip like a hurricane
Freeze like cocaine, or you get a smoke brain
G Rap, Polo, Doc the Butcher all together
We're forever
The trilogy of terror",Trilogy of Terror
Kool G Rap,"The umm security we have here today 
Not the open security 
The ones that that really sittin' there 
And really think we don't know who they are! 

""Now that's funky"" 
""Now that's funky"" 
""Now that's funky"" 
""Now that's funky"" 
 
Crime don't pay that's what they tell us 
But that's because the other motherfuckers gettin' jealous 
But I'ma tell you this they neighborhood got the Goodfellas 
But they come arrest us for the same shit they sell us 
Cause they don't want to see a young black nigga rollin' 
Inside a nice car, nice kit, without the shit bein' stolen 
So they come and lock a nigga up 
Meanwhile some corrupt, politician nigga is makin' bigger bucks 
Niggaz gettin' blamed for the crystals; but we don't grow 
The motherfuckin' coke or weed or make the fuckin' pistols 
Niggaz ain't tryin' to live in poverty 
And a black man's lottery's a motherfuckin' robbery 
So yo you gotta make your best 
Make a small investment and then put it to the test (""I know!"") 
Yes, cause the other motherfuckers gettin over 
Police don't look at a white man strange drivin' a Range Rover 
Carrying shit like it's minerals 
The big dollar white dollar suit and tie criminals 
Even the government figures 
Sellin' shit to the motherfuckin' Columbians and rich niggaz 
Crime isn't time from the brothers 
Hey you say it don't pay, it's payin white motherfuckers 
It all depends on how you do your shit 
'Cause either learn it quick intelligent and that's it 
(""I beg your pardon?"") You're well fittin' 
Fuck workin' for a bastard 
I gotta see that money before my ass sees a casket 
Get paid, motherfuck a raise 
'Cause to all them improper crooked coppers, crime pays 

""Jack you motherfuckers"" 
""Jack you motherfuckers"" 
""Wake up and go for what you know"" 
""Everybody's got to make a living"" 
""Boy I'm trying to make me some money!!"" 
 
Stop, nigga stop, nigga freeze 
But at the same time, some old rich fuck, is drivin' by with twenty ki's 
Because they came up with a law 
To keep the rich motherfuckers rich and the poor motherfuckers poor 
We take the cake you get the crumbs 
Stackin' up a package of cracks, to sell to blacks in the slums 
Guns are bein' sold over the counter 
And you wonder why your daughter's head was slaughtered when they found her 
Why did he have to shoot the bitch 
But the bitch I mean the witch just had to switch 
To make the nigga Richie Rich 
Yeah, so I'm throwin' you the phrase 
Believe me when I tell you motherfuckin' crime pays",Crime Pays
Kool G Rap,"Brothers on the corner sellin' junk 
got held up by the hotties got the shotties in the trunk 
You got the hard rocks wavin' glocks at the punks 
Police only harass you when they want to get a chunk 
They got so many corners and they got so many spots 
And I can't even bump up the block 
without the ""Yo man what you got?"" 
I'm walkin' past somebody lookin' strange 
He's lookin' for a hit for veins 
or he'll blow out somebody's brains 
Even the shorties livin' naughty lives 
Walkin' around, even drive around, with big forty-fives 
I just found out the candy store's a front 
They walk in the candy store 
Man G, candy's far from what they want 
You might see a pickle or a popsicle 
But if you step to the back, you get dimes, twenties, and nickels 
Honey used to look like a winner 
Now she can't even get took to dinner 
cause so many dealers ran up in her 
Somebody's blood is on the tar 
Last night was a homicide from a fight inside the bar 
Loudmouth tryin' to show her ass, but somebody 
broke a whiskey bottle and cut her butt up with the glass 
Money got robbed for his bank 
They broke in his house and took everything 
except the kitchen sink 
Little man murdered on the scene 
He tried to come off at the liquor store, he's only 17 
Granny's damn near pushin' 80 
A couple of hoods grabbed her pocketbook, and stabbed up the lady 
Cover your head, cause it's a dead zone, in the red zone 
Yeah, this is my home sweet home 

Three card molly, another man to fool 
Whites will stop at the red lights, to look at us like animals 
I'm gettin' frisked by the cops 
They only tryin' to get props, for blowin' off a black man's top 
Up in apartment 3G, this sweetie named DiDi wants to see me 
but yo I heard she's givin' VD 
Just when you think the skies are gettin' blue 
Bang bang -- another brother's split in two 
Can't sleep, cause the streets are filled with danger 
Miss, your little daughter's a swinger, you can't change her 
She left with a stranger, inside a drug dealer's party 
Now off to the morgue, to go identify her body 
Sonny boy is goin' on the strip 
Robbin niggas cracks, with a mac, without a clip 
Somebody gave a tip, so the next time he flipped 
and shorty got ragged, another body bag is zipped 
A baby is born and needs lovin' 
but instead, the mother smothered him and shoved him in a oven 
Cops killin' our kids, but they bill us 
So what's more worse, the killer cops or the Cop Killers 
Everyday's another risk 
I'm even mad to go to my pad, the hallways always smell like piss 
No heat, just pots of hot water 
I'm walkin' eight flights up, the elevator's out of order 
Man that landlord is the lowest 
Because I let my door slam and saw a damn eviction notice 
I felt like breakin' all his bones, psh 
I'm gettin' kicked out of my home sweet home",Home Sweet Home
Kool G Rap,"""Late last night two undercover police officers were found brutally murdered in a Fort Greene 
Apartment building in Brooklyn New York. At this time police have no suspects. 
Now to the weather but first G tell 'em what time it is!"" 

I got a chance to get some money so I'm takin' it 
No joke because this bein' broke shit just ain't makin' it 
Cause I grew up in the fast line 
See my pops ran the numbers and my moms held the blackjack games 
Now I'm able to leave the cradle 
I don't remember the dinners, only the kilos on my kitchen table 
Sittin' right beside a pistol 
And I'm watchin' my pops, pick up bricks made out of crystal 
While he was countin' the green 
I seen nothin' but strainers, containers, scales and rocks on a triple beam 
People was too afraid to stick him up 
Because he had the most notorious brothers to come and pick him up 
When I reached ten years old 
I never recalled seein' any more money and drugs in the household 
'Cause now pops was on his feet 
And to keep us from gettin' hurt he kept his dirt in the street 
And if he tried to attack, your family's wearin' black 
Because he just got your death, put on a contract 
Another sucker to rub 
Even my mother's walkin' around packin' a .357 snub 
And many cops dropped dead 
I seen a man pull out a pistol and blow off an undercover's head 
'Cause it's hard to get by 
And that's why, when you're young in the streets 
You gotta live and let die 

Some say this ain't the life to choose 
Rage is snapped away you get a page in the Daily News 
But I just want to get paid off 
'Cause if I was workin' a regular nine to five I'd get laid off 
Some people say, sellin' weight, is a death date 
But I can't wait, to set up shop, in the next state 
I ain't worried bout a brother tryin' to take mines 
'Cause my plot comes with a hundred shot nine 
Police are right on my heels 
But I'm always one step ahead of the punks makin' dope deals 
They can't stop me 'cause I'm proper 
And if they ever try to raid they better bring choppers or helicopters 
I broke a lot of punks ribs 
Dumpin' they bodies in lots, then I ran and shot up the cribs 
Because a brother ain't fakin' it 
If there's a record for killin' the most niggaz then yo I'm breakin' it 
I wish a brother would flex 
I spray him up and then take all of his money and give his girl sex 
That's how I'm livin' in the street 
You either give a sucker two in the head, or you'll be dead meat 
I'm sendin' punks six feet deep 
And gettin' money in lumps, cause this ain't Twenty-One Jump Street 
You want to stop what I supply 
Aiyyo, the hell with that, I gotta live and let die 

Police, police! Everybody down, everybody down! 
Don't fucking move, get down! 
Hey, where is everybody? 
Look, there's nobody here 
What's that fucking noise?  
It's a bomb, it's a bomb, let's go 
Get the fuck out of here! 

You gotta live and let die 
Forget all that bullshit about savin' the soul 
Some chump'll pump your ass full of bullet holes 
So I'm out to make a killin' 
And all you suckers are chillin' 'cause I ain't just an ordinary villain 
I got a rep for mass murder 
If you look bigger, I just pull the trigger, a female I just hurt her 
I got the .38 long 
But a dame can get the same if she's comin' out of her mouth wrong 
And if you try to oppose this 
Next time you see your mother she'll be covered with roses 
It ain't about a fair fight 
Because I only get open for smokin' suckers in daylight 
Another punk bites the dust 
'Cause I just bust blood out your butt like pus 
The broke life I ain't missin 
Because now I got a lot, and that's more than a pot to piss in 
And if I'm sellin you ki's 
Just put the G's on the bed, and then go head and take a freeze 
And while you're numbin' your tongue with the yum yum 
I pull out a gun, cause I want every last crumb 
I put a slug in your face 
Then I waits to start packin' the trap back in the suitcase 
Another punk had to fry 
I don't want to do it but yo I gotta live and let die

Kool G Rap,"I got a job with the mob, makin G's
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunkie
I'm ridin around with ten kilos inside my trunk G
And I'm holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars right in my motherfuckin face
And I'm tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to make a motherfuckin run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? They'll find me floatin in the Hudson river
But if I escape, I'll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I'm supposed to make a stop
To an Uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
Cause I'm sick of puttin my motherfuckin ass on the line
I got the money and the hit
Went through the Brook nonstop cause I ain't droppin off shit
Then I thought of a plan
So I droves to my house and got my girl and my little man
C'mon bitch, pack the shit, get ready
""God damn why your face all sweaty?""
Just hurry up and get the shit
I'm a dead man bitch, understand, we gotta split
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin like I was goin on a motherfuckin world tour
Grabbed my bags and my gun
C'mon we gotta go... I'm on the motherfuckin run

Now I'm drivin and I'm lookin at my passport
I'm outta here soon as my ass hit the airport
I loaded up the automatic
I don't believe this shit, I'm stuck in motherfuckin traffic
I'm gettin nervous as a fuck see
A Lincoln Continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my bitch and then I bent low
*gunfire, breaking glass* Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the bitches back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin italian motherfuckers in the neck
Looked at my bitch a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain't givin up a motherfucker
Niggaz runnin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by fuckin inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my bitch is harmed?
Shit they only hit her in the fuckin arm
Now I'm drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is catchin motherfuckin heartburns
I got the car shakin wildly
I made a turn, and then I dipped my shit into a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin shit is done
I'm on the motherfuckin run

The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin in this motherfucker all night
I started pullin on my hoe
""c'mon man what?"" Wake up bitch, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I'm headin South no doubt
And I don't give a fuck where, as long it's a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That's when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my bitch she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
I pulled it -- bullets started flyin
Now I'm hittin all them bastards
I'm droppin em fast, splashin blood out niggaz asses
Then I'm finally done and
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I'm lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up the sucker
Put my gun to his head, ""Whassup now motherfucker?""
He said, ""Wait, I want to talk""
I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil's gun
Now I'm no longer on the motherfuckin run",On the Run

Kool G Rap,"Back in the days was kinda crazy, kid.  I started out with nothin'.
Wasn't livin' like Thanksgiving; I was turkey without the stuffin'.
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the poorhouse.
Say mama caught the drama; she would bleed tryin' to feed four mouths.
Wasn't rockin' Girbauds; I barely had clothes, and when it snowed,
And temperatures droppin' below zero, you know I froze.
No CD's, a black and white TV, a seat is a rubber tire.
With a hanger for the antenna, turned channels with some pliers.
Had nothin' in my cabinet, but cans of Raid.
I'm knockin' on my neighbor's door,
To borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid.
I wasn't freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped; I'm trippin',
'Cause my winter coat got lost buttons,
And zippers that wouldn't stay zipped.
I never remembered Jack, the brother was straight fat cat.
Not even a Big Mac black, I had Kid Castle topped with crackerjacks.
Walkin' the streets, with the weak sneaks on my feet,
And the freaks wouldn't speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek.
So much for gettin' humped from the stunts, I always struck out.
The one y'all likes is takin' hikes, if you can't pull a buck out.
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls,
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world.
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world! 
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines.
I gotsta get mines, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm blowin' up in the world.

Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines.
I gotsta get mines, yeah
It seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back:
""Get your butt up out the sack, and find a job, or hit the road, Jack."" 
Black, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona.
With a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin' than Tony Rhoma's.
In order to get straight, I gotsta to make a muscle;
Learned to hustle and bustle, and I gave the streets a tussle.
Standin' down on the corner, slangin' fat rocks to bottles.
With the black tops, for cops got my shorty watchin' my back, Hobbes.
Makin' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton, Gucci.
Hoochies callin' me boochi, while they smooch me, givin' up the coochie.
Now I'm a felon, started sellin', and splittin' melons.
I started gellin', to tellin' police, just 'cause I was swellin'
Hangin' out on the corner, playin' cee-lo, rollin' for half a kilo.
Yo, you'll never see G-low a-goin' below.
Yeah, straight gettin' fortunate, as long as fees was torchin' it.
It started gettin' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin' it.
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me, and diss me,
'Cause business in drugs is gettin' too risky.
So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch up tramps' diamonds and pearls.
Straight up, baby, I'm blowin' up in the world.
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines.
I gotsta get mines, you know what I'm sayin'?  I'm blowin' up in the world.
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world! 
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines.
I gotsta get mines, yeah
I got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, ""It's a Demo,""
And started chillin' in limos with champagne and tinted windows.
Hoppin', no time for pages, sportin' gold chains and rings.
Clockin' money and fame, nothin' changed, I'm still the same.
Just spendin' twenties and tens at women pullin' on my linen,
And grinnin' 'cause I was winnin' in this game, from the beginning.
The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill.
So I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills.
I turned from a hobo to a solo, bozin' for dolos.
Stole my dough, you still below, now I perfer cigars and blow Mo'.
So catch a flashback, of a G. Rap track, attacked, like a headcrack.
That's smack, through your cap, with the lead black,
And here's a new cut, for pooh-butt, rappers hangin' from off my
Two nuts, like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux. 
So peep Kool G. Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's witcha girl.
Straight up kid, I'm blowin' up in the world.
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines.

Brain after brain, I'm a motherfuckin' chain smoker 
'Cause it's the rootin' tootin' with the six-shooter 
Put a hole in your trooper so big niggaz can hula hoop ya 
Liftin' them Smith and Wessuns like the westerns 
I blow out a niggaz intestines, and send him back to the fuckin' essence 
Bullet rows, blows out the nose of my fo'-fo' 
Gunnin down all you bozos who run and call for po-po 
Send in paramedics and bring a lot of antisthetics 
Motherfuckin' bodies are beheaded, niggaz are shredded 
So nigga get ready to meet your fuckin' fate, when I send six trey-eight 
Straight into your motherfuckin' chest plate 
G. Rap been murderin' niggaz since a child, you can go and check my files 
I'm killin' executioner style 

[Repeat x2]
Comin' straight off the sidewalks of New York 
A nigga livin foul, ""I kill em executioner style""",Executioner Style
Kool G Rap,"I knew a youngster met him at 14 a very short scene 
Fiendin' to make his dreams come true but see money was caught mean 
Started runnin' wild and livin' life type of foul that was my shorty's style 
But deep down in heart he was still only a child 

He was typin' nice at ball if he had height y'all 
Might of been 'NBA Today' instead I watched his life fall 
Blowin' up the spots and poppin' them tec glocks 
Collectin' street props, splittin' tops, didn't stop, so many men dropped 

Started committin' murder after murder 
Blasted the last nigga that tried to riff so fast he flipped him like a burger 
Slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger 
He got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger 

And this type of street violence today happens too often 
It hit me hard as hell to see my dog up in the coffin 
People droppin' a rose when the casket is closed 
Hey yo, that's the name of the game out on the street, that's how it goes 

They say: ""Live by the trigger, die by the trigger"" 
It ain't about whose gun is more bigger, nigga 
It's bout whose draw is quicker 
So to my shorty dog puzzled I'm pledgin' 

Died at the age of 17, Brooklyn East New York legend 
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers) 
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another 
 
Thinkin' back when I was chillin' with K-Von, but now he's long gone 
So I carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on 
Me and black-o way back in childhood when we was wild hoods 
Runnin around the neighborhood and up to no good 

Started hangin' hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars 
Then put behind bars sellin' drugs and pullin' yards 
Then my crimey got locked up for cookin' the rock up 
Started bouncin' uptown to stuck up, my nigga straight blew the block up 

Yeah, the blue and whites was on sight runnin' with flashlights 
On the double a fast life, that's when he seen his last nights 
Out on the street runnin' from the heat 
Then got locked up from (Happy New Year!) 

All the way down to (New Year's Eve!) 
The two of those in a wardrobe of clothes 
Got back on crackin', I let him whip the macks and go lookin' for hoes 
And then another sad story is headed for me 

When i found out another soldier died in the territory 
So in memory of my dog I write a lyric 
Straight hopin' melodies travel from my mind to your spirit 
Hear it when I get biz for K-Von, I'm pledgin' 

Died on 104 Northern Boulevard, Corona, Queens legend 
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers) 
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another 3X 
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)

Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go 
(G: And aiyyo what you don't know believe the ghetto knows) 

[Kool G. Rap] 
New York New York the city that never sleeps 
Bodies covered in white sheets are layin' in the streets 
Shit gets deep as we creep up the block by the kids slangin' rocks 
And holdin' glocks stolen from the cops to get props 

You gotta split a top on the regular 
Or get plugged in your mug, from a slug, by your competitor 
Gunshots echo throughout the city like thunder, no wonder 
Another brother six feet under 

You know it ain't no jokin' when the streetlights are broken 
So keep your eyes open, or get ready for a, smokin' 'loc 
Step out of line, I hope you got your nine gun son 
The Smith and Wess', you better press 9-1-1 (word up) 

Or make a run for it there's too many to tackle 
The Big Apple will put your ass on ice like a Snapple 
So even though I rap I gots to stay strapped 
Niggas act up I back up (PI-YAH) 

I bust a cap inside your fuckin' hat 
Don't even pose with them hoes, the swinger that you chose 
Just might be down with the foes, only the shadow knows 
And ain't no lollipop, lollipop over here only the shottie pops 

(BOOM) Now just sit back and watch the bodies drop 
The younger gunmen got the bigger niggaz runnin' 
The shorties (what) the shorties (what) the shorties are comin' 
To push a nigga wig back, and leave his ass flat on his back 

The motherfuckin' ghetto knows, and it's like that 

[Chorus] 

[Kool G. Rap] 
Today's headlines, another nigga dead 
Six to the body and fo' to the head 
Followed the red bitch in the bed full of lead 
A drug-related case and now the place is filled with Feds 

Ramshacked the shack, disclose 'bout two kilos of dope 
Two ounces of coke's caught in the pocket of his coat 
So, another brother caught the ultimate surprise 
With blown out brains, to drop stains on his eyes 

Dazed as I sit back and watch the channel two news 
Watchin' his family goin' through all the boo-hoos 
You lose, like an Ill Street, the Blues are gettin' deeper 
Nothin' left in the room except for him, the Grim Reaper 

Police are takin' [unknown] snapshots, scoop up some blood drops 
Pull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots 
The cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street 
So they just, pull out the white sheets, to cover up the dead meat 

Seal off the area with yellow tape, draw the white 
chalk around the body now the party has to motivate 
One more outlaw, was murdered on the scene for the green 
Died at the age of seventeen 

[Chorus] 

[Kool G. Rap] 
Strollin' the concrete, packin' my heat, walkin' the backstreets 
I seen niggaz pull up, peepin' me out the side a black Jeep 
Six feet deep, that's where I'm goin' if I'm slippin' 
Steady cockin' my shit cause I already got the clip in 

Now who's the first nigga to run up, here they come up 
The block hardrocks with glocks rollin' holdin' they guns up 
I buck, I buck, and then I struck one in the chest 
Nigga should of wore a vest but now his ass is put to rest 

But now I got three mo' niggaz, pullin triggers 
Strays are ricochetin' off the bricks, zigga zigga 
But who got the biggest strap? Who's bustin' bigger caps? 
My BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS 

No haps, G. Rap ain't goin' out like a sucker 
I reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker 
Quick, I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin' at me 
'Cause I won't be too happy with a slug inside my nappy 

Two more niggaz left, they scared to death, but I'm leary 
Shit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me 
I went between two cars, lettin' off the quarter pound 
I see another body fallin' down to the ground 

Quick I run up on him cause I don't think that he's dead 
Standin' over his ass I put two more inside his head 
That's three niggaz down, only got one nigga to go 
I gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so 

I lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up 
Nearly shot my whole clip up, I got one more slug to rip up 
Look over by the GS, see his ass stickin his head out 
Boom, let the lead out, blew a piece of his brain dead out 
The back of his head, now he's dead, because he fell face down 

Right on the motherfuckin' streets that he dwelled

It's Big 1 son Jamaica Queens is the turf
And I'ma exploit heaven and earth for what it's worth
It's the MC extraordinaire the jewels glare
The God is rare I'm takin' bitches back to my lair
I want mines and yours, strippin' niggaz to they drawers
No probable cause, with the chrome double 4's
It's the Queens New Yorker with a bulletproof parka
In eighty-four, it was Calvins and British Walkers
Now I'm sippin' Harvey's Bristal Cream with the glock 17
As the sirens race to the scene
Tryin' to get dough, like Pablo, today, fuck tomorrow
Seats for carro, as I recline in Monte Carlo
I got the game down to a science, it's the clients
That turn small time hustlers into giants
Three course meal, waitin' for my appetizer
Blowin' like a geyser, time only makes me wiser
Paraphenalia, and material, makes the crew imperial

Crackheads worship me like I'm Jesus
Uncle Sam can't stand me cause I'm fuckin' all his nieces
Cuties every color, who I wanna fuck next?
Buy a new car, maybe Lamborghini trunk next
Look at the jealousy in the eyes of the roughnecks
Bulletproof glass just in case they wanna buck Tecs

With the pound-seven, I be creepin', rockin' niggaz, while they sleepin'.

When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin', marchin' to Zion.
'Cause the pound-cake, roars like a lion.

Ready for action, makin' your heart catch contractions.
In the underworld, shootin' gallery niggaz lose calories,

Here I come to get some motherfuckin' wreck, but first I gotta, 
Um, vest check, uncheck, clip one check, clip two check, I'm set.

Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down.
I see 'em, he's comin' out the fuckin' Coliseum,
And hopped into a B-M, shit! 
Put in my clip, and then I dipped into the ride that my man had, 
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide.
I'm rainin' on him, (faster nigga.) oh yeah, we're gainin' on him.
(Oh shit, he's with somebody else.)  Fuck it, put his brain on him.
Boom, boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat.
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver.
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin' up a cigarette.
Bang, bang, I left the other nigga wet.

 but look in disgust, plot to seize the shinin sea 
 From coppin the V-T-W-E-L-V-E 
 Pissed off at G's but we don't believe in knockin knees 
 We cock and squeeze, and leave some shit shot and breeze 
 Attractin these chicks mixed, black and japanese 
 And slappin these nitwits, with fat stacks of G's 
 Bag your rat, she should lack, grabbin the back of threes 
 On her knees, see more semen than all the seven seas 
 She goldminin, lookin for new fashion designin 
 Rings with rocks blindin cause my world started shinin, uhh 
 Chorus: missjones and G Rap

 Sippin wine from up a little grapevine 
 Too much ice up on the wrist to tell the time

 Will you cock the nine and sneak me from behind?

 With jet skis, only sex G's, with S-E's

 Baguettes be the ice makin my neck and chest freeze 
 Vietnamese, Tibetan G's with wet beads 
 in sets of three, breasts in 3-D that slept with me 
 The sexy, beauty of the week of the ? G's 
 Bangladesh G's, on the other side of the Red Sea 
 The lefty, sippin Remi inside the Pepsi 
 Jew-els shinin, holdin down what you fell behind in 
 Mink shit with silk linin, penetrate right through

 Organized crimin, bank rolls yeah we get those 
 Fly clothes, slip those, spot foes then we hit those 
 The whole click glow, click the sickoes

 Hollow tops spit those, let the dough pile

 Tryin to leave me and my cream wet up

 Call the coroners to make they bed up 
 Infrared shit from neck up 
 Before they got to lit the tec up

 It was a setup my nigga got hit they blew his chest up 
 The hollow tips ripped his vest up son is messed up 
 and blessed up; call my cast up it's time to dress up 
 Four-fifth and Smith-n-Wessed up, ready to press up 
 and fuck their nest up, the enemy is Hennessey to sessed up 
 Actin up, hit my motherfuckin man up 
 Never again will he stand up, yo Big Jan hook the plan up 
 Pull the masks, pull the van up 
 These niggaz tryin to hit the fam up; these small times cats 
 Yo fuck that, I can't see that, where them niggaz be at? 
 Where they hang at? Where they live at? Where they slang at? 
 (Aiyyo Son one is a known cat, he walk around with the chrome gat 
 This hoodrat know where the nigga home at) 
 Well here's a quarter baby, go and phone that 
 This motherfucker bout to get his shit blown back 
 His whole dome clapped, we cock back the gats and started cruisin 
 Up the boulevards and avenues-n, I'm short fusin 
 and two biscuit usin; mad hot but, not in the mood for losin 
 We hit the strip pickin up clues and 
 we on the heels of this nigga shoes and 
 out the blue when, we see the chick the nigga screwin 
 Pushin his whip with the ice cuban 
 Hemmed her up sweet, put heat to her wig piece, the zig piece 
 to this nig's beefs, this bitch named Charise 
 from East New York, listen bitch, you better talk 
 Or get your whole frame surrounded, with white chalk 
 Pulled the rat in back of the van, bitch we don't want you 
 we want your man, you understand? 
 The hoe said, ""Please, I got his house keys, the nigga got 
 five keys and mad cheese, a hundred G's"" 
 Lie to me bitch you gettin one of these 
 Four-five see's in both knees, she said, ""Honestly I promise G 
 I'm not lying,"" then the hoe started crying 
 We hit the road me and my niggaz flying 
 to the crib in Jackson Heights, the nigga live three flights up 
 He type buck, but I ain't givin a fuck 
 Grab his bitch up, make the hoe go first in case 
 the nigga buck, open the door up, and put the stunt in front 
 Then we all started creepin, he stretched out 
 up on the sofa sleepin, yeah me and my cats standin there 
 just peepin, money's about to get laced 
 My nigga Ty threw a glass of whiskey in his face 
 Big Jan ready to blaze the place; he on his way 
 to Amazing Grace -- nigga woke up and saw the big guns 
 Me and my two sons, he knew he was done 
 You hurt a loved one, step back about to let him have one 
 Yo fuck that, aiyyo black, where the sack of heroin at? 
 I'm bout to give cat some motherfuckin railroad tracks 
 We dumped the whole bag inside a spoon and left the room 
 to heat that, and came right back, yo grab the nigga arm black 
 Put raw shit in the nigga vein, watch the needle drain 
 Went from being restrained to mad 'tane 
 Less than a moment nigga started zonin 
 His mouth foamin, lookin like he possessed by The Omen 
 His bitch was reachin for the phone and, I had to smack her 
 with the chrome and, left her on the floor moanin 
 Cocked back, I had to finish this, know my stee' 
 we leave no witnesses, shot and got the fuck out the premises

 Every criminal mug be living in luxury what the fuck G? 
 That must be Bugsy in the black tux over there with Lucky 
 Bring my heater niggaz might try to slug me 
 Take me out in back of the club and buck me and touch me 
 I felt a hand tug me then turnin around I peeped the lovely 
 Fly face fat ass gave me a glass of bubbly said 
 ""Compliments of Bugsy "" then took me across the persian rug to plug me 
 He shook my hand and hugged me; thought he would do me ugly 
 but he dug me, pockets chubby said, ""Nino where them drugs be?"" 
 Over there by the derby, buy they dirty devils from me 
 to keep my paper sturdy, yo word G

 I be D and fuck all that living thirsty, so Nino

 Dead as a motherfuckin zombie, full of my ammo 
 With Bugs Mirando, against the grain so, gotta send him 
 over the rainbow, he must be brain slow, caught him down 
 at the train po' in Santo Domingo, left him for dead 
 Two bullets in his Tango, like how that movie Shane go 
 Frank Costello, hostile fellow, he murders while remainin mellow 
 but most of the niggaz on his team was yellow 
 Cold blooded veins flowin with red Jell-o 
 There's Joe Adonis, had mad dramas, won't hesitate 
 to put you in pajamas, fly hooker fine as the Pocahontas 
 Beauty queen you'll wanta pok-her-hiendas 
 Frank broke a promise between the organized crimers and old timers 
 Costello gotta go six below, nobody voted no 
 to veto, so they hit him with a hollow torpedo 
 Up in his torso, he ain't a boss so, he can go 
 without ever lettin the whole police force know

 Wanted to own his whole zone, it leaked out

 Non-stop static inside the rackets

 Pretty Boy Floyd was non-void, unemployed, he destroyed shit 
 with the Infamous click, wasn't to be toyed with 
 Mad jealous of all the liquor sellers 
 Shinin with wine cellars, turn em from hood dwellers to Goodfellas 
 Me and Nitty was like bank tellers, nothin niggaz could tell us 
 We drove all over, I pushed a shiny yellow Testarossa 
 Moved on it closer get the toaster 
 Started to feel like death was closer, I hit Capone hard 
 Murder him and his bodyguard in they car and dust the chaffeur 
 Beef over, I blew him like a supernova 
 Niggaz nicknamed me, The Black Cobra 
 The Lady Casanova, yo I'm even deadly when I'm sober 
 Act like you got a chip on your shoulder 
 And blast the two right through your boulder

 Nigga you fuckin with a soldier, wake up and smell the Folgers 
 Niggaz out here done lie in piss to cover up the odor

 But yo here comes Greasy Thumbs, who wants to get the easy funds 
 He whispered in my eardrum 
 ""Let's take over the entire city, and split the dough

 four niggaz clutchin they burners and bustin 
 but only could see one in sight 
 The one on my right yo son he like we both got gripe 
 He wanted my life come at a nigga 
 with a gun and a knife 
 He tryin to make the wiped out nigga layin up under the white 
 But I ain't tryin to go up in no dark tunnel 
 and burn to the light 
 And let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night 
 And done in on sight, and tryin to breathe 
 with one in my pipe 
 But I'm not one of the type, and I'd rather lose all hung on the mic 
 Than to be up in the yard receivin CPR 
 at one in the night 
 Now I can run and take fllght, but alright, yo son'll be hyped 
 And I've played mother nature before 
 so yo I'm clappin thunder tonight 
 I step right, inside of the street light, my gun it was bright 
 Send him to kiss Christ, and let my shit slice 
 in front of him twice 
 Let one splice, cause fuckin with price, ain't tryin to be nice 
 I want him on ice, no back home 
 to a son and a wife 
 He tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice 
 Nigga was all enticed to lead his life sheist 
 but none of it's nice 
 I peeped shit, and seen his whole click, was runnin in fright 
 instead of comin to fight, get someone to fight 
 you son of a dykes 
 With one in the pipe, I'm aimin to light the one on the right 
 They all deceased, so yo my asspiece 
 get hunted for life 
 Four niggaz cut down, and I can receive one hundred to life 
 up in a jailcell, that's crawlin with lice 
 and runnin with mice 
 Live trife, fillin appetities with nothin but rice

 Look like he desperate 
 Pulled down the tinted glass and let the Tec spit 
 It's hectic, car flew in bodega with his neck hit 
 Body and head was separate, totally disconnected 
 Bust back two shots 
 at ones that standin with cannons up on the rooftops 
 that drew glocks, but my 20/20 spot em for two blocks

Kool G Rap,"He's the big boss when his hands criss cross
Up and down the crossfader turning wax to sauce
It ain't a hip hop record that he can't chop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

The rhythm he brings makes the audience swing
While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJs relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade
The man at the top of the needle drop
Polo let's have some fun, show them how it's done
Treat them like your son, in the butcher shop

DJs he's disputed you should be saluted
The man gives a cut with scratches included
I'm cool G Rap, he's my DJ
This is a mortal combat of the Polo play
Cuts like a scissor, rips like a razor
The sound penetrates elements like a laser
The beat connects to my dialect
New Technic turntables, the party I wreck
Motivation to blend, the rotation begins
They reported his fins on 1010 West
And his name is Polo the phonograph is for bolo
I go solo, to battle cool G Rap is no-no, bozo
Your style is so-so, equal to disco
Swing and some go-go, and on to calypso
So biters and reciters, don't mean to offend you
Yes I will continue but I'm not a menu
So don't bite or swallow or fight or follow
Recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
Polo is like Zorro, war hero
Horror, terror, errors: zero
The alert concert network expert
He'll wreck dissect inject insert
Cuts, til your eardrums pop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

Rapper with data, the best in the media
Or area, so prepare for your burial
On your radio, pull out your aerial
Or antenna cause this one is a winner
Not a sinner, or an MC beginner
Cool G Rap is just me not he or she or we
Or any other MC

Listen 
You get upset when you hear the Large Professor 
On your girl's cassette deck expect 
Nothin comin soft 'cause I'll never throw weaker blows 
I'll kick you in your [ass] and your breath'll smell like sneaker soles 
Now how's that for a fixin'? 
You'd better rather go to Roy's, cause I ain't kickin' science fiction 
I kick a size nine sneaker or boot 
Chop chumps to stumps, and they remain minute 
The Sheik, I get deep, and always leave with the wet meat 
Because of my technique, I'm the one you let speak 
I collect crops and props like spinach 
I'm vintage, your single sums up to a ten inch 
My soul brother Van Paul and Pete Rock 
Keep the funk flowin' until the last beat stops 
The soul man, can't have you leavin' on a stretcher 
Probably, have you leavin in leather, I catch a body 
From wreckin' slum rappers, but to be frank 
I don't give a [fuck] I got money in the bank

Those beholdin' the words of a master 
Find mental disaster, as I kick it faster 
Whoever opposes me, and what I feel 
Might find their legs bein' replaced by steel 
This is a brand new year, and the penalty is death 
So there won't be a lot of suckers left 
I grab the mic, and I load it like a long four-fifth 
Huh, and dare you to riff 
Or even sneeze as I blow you to your knees, have you curled up 
In a corner like a dog, with hoof in mouth disease 
Spittin' razor blades, cuttin' veins you can't stitch 
I got you screamin like a [bitch] 
I took your microphone, you can't get it back 
Because your rap was wack

To my opponents, let me just demonstrate for a minute

Stop your diction you drop, the science fiction

I'm too terrific and scientific, forget it 
Don't even try to limp it, you're not ready to make hits 
You still got a learner's permit 
Poppin' that [shit], you better sit 
Here's a word, of a third degree burn, so listen and learn 
You're missin' a turn, so you better get, concerned

With a silencer, wettin' up, suckers I be settin' up 
Button up, while I'm cuttin' up, never lettin' up

You want to run up, you better run up light 
Cause like a whorehouse shippin' out [pussy] tonight 
Believe me I ain't goin' out like a brick parachute 
Or a fruit, or a guy that wears Brut 
Cologne, I'm violent prone, so leave me alone 
I'm about to set fire to the microphone 
And leave the mic so hot you need potholders for this 
Due to burnt wires it's cordless

Not now, I'm takin' money to the bank

Kool G Rap,"This is poison so be alert and cautious
Those who act courageous you will get nauseous
Infected or contaminated
Turn on your stereo never come radio-activated
Deadly and fatal, poison the title
My recital hits the parts that are vital
So tune in the tone of beats and poems
Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones
Pull out your Q-tips, clean out the earwax
If you're still hard of hearing
I'mma scrub them with Ajax
With maximum drum so behave and remember
You're a slave to my sound wave
Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find
A new method time after time
Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen
Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then
Put it on paper cause I make you hyper
Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper
Like cherries or some say berries
Mandatory for the auditorium's glory
Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me
G speaks in a new technique of fury
Combination of drums and noise and
Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison

Poison!

Look-alikes on the mic you should get off
You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get
Rid of, cause you bit off
Bite off, ate off. Imitate off
They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off
Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup
Male or female shut them up, Polo shut her up

Yo, you heard what he said shut the hell up, man

Yeah, hide my line as you pick them up
Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as
Well have said: ""stick 'em up.""
Letters of metaphor matters to
Better the fatter your pocket
Rhymes blast off like rockets
Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased
In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass
Made in a minute the sky is the limit
For reaching the goal and the dream
Wouldn't you want to be in it to win it?
Biters are wanted like animals hunted
Soon as I get them I hit them I done it
To the suckers who fronted
The rappers who made it and did it
Forget about winning the battle cause
I'mma shake rattle and roll
A little something for girls and boys and
Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison

Read the label sucker
P-O-I-S-O-N yeah, Poison

Poison!

A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That separates dogs from divine
Take it as a caution, or a warning sign
Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them
Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's
With Polo and while he's slicing
I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson
My brain is like a factory constantly creating
Material stitch by stitch for decoration
Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining
My passion in rhyming is fashion designing
Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it
You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show
And my brain glows just like a rainbow
Rappers and poets they already know it
G Rap is a terror not a error and never
Will I stop reaching for better
Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel
G Rap will make you feel the real deal
I usually rap hardcore and I know
That y'all thinking am I somehow semi, so
We yell ""party"" and girls and boys and
Remember Kool G Rap, Doc the Butcher and Polo is poison",Poison
Kool G Rap,"[Verse One:] 
 When I was five years old I realized there was a road 
 At the end I will win lots of pots of gold 
 Never took a break never made a mistake 
 Took time to create 'cause there's money to make 
 To be a billionaire takes hard work for years 
 Some nights I sheded tears while I sent up prayers 
 Been through hard times even worked part time 
 In a seafood store sweepin floors for dimes 
 I was sort of a porter takin the next man's order 
 Breakin my back for ?a shack for headquarters? 
 All my manpower for four bucks an hour 
 Took the time, I wrote rhymes in the shower 
 Shoes are scoffed 'cause the road gets rough 
 But I'ma rock it til my pockets ain't stuffed enough 
 All the freaks wouldn't speak 'cause my checks was weak 
 They would turn the other cheek so I started to seek 
 A way to get a play, and maybe one day 
 I'll be performin up a storm for a decent pay 
 No matter how it seems I always kept the dream 
 All the girlies scream and suckas get creamed 
 Dreamed about it for five years straight 
 Finally I got a break and cut my first plate 
 The road ain't yellow and there ain't no witches 
 My name is cool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches 
 
[Verse Two:] 
 I used to stand on the block sellin cooked up rock 
 Money bustin out my sock 'cause I really would clock 
 They were for kind of fiends bringin jackets and jeans 
 Magazines, anything, just to hustle for beans 
 The cash was comin fast, money grew like grass 
 People hungry for the blast that don't even last 
 Didn't want to be involved but the money will getcha 
 Gettin richer and richer, the police took my picture 
 But I still supplied, some people I knew died 
 Murders and homicides for bottles of suicide 
 Money, jewelry, livin like a star 
 And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car 
 In a small-time casino, the town's Al Pacino 
 For all of the girls, the pretty boy Valentino 
 I shot up stores and I kicked down doors 
 Collecting scars from little neighborhood wars 
 Many legs I broke, many necks I choked 
 And if provoked I let the pistol smoke 
 Loyal members in a crew now down with the game 
 Sellin nickels and dimes, sunshine or rain 
 What I had was bad from my shoes to my pad 
 In the first time in my life loanin money to dad 
 Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches 
 My name is cool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches 
 
 [Verse Three:] 
 A thug a-mugs? for drugs, he eventually bugs 
 Lookin for crack on carpets and rugs 
 The squealers tells? but the dealer still sells 
 Little spoiled kids inheritin oil wells 
 I was the type on the opposite side 
 Of smokin the pipe, in a beef I got hype 
 'cause rags to riches switches men to witches 
 Become stitches, body bags in ditches 
 Bloodshed, I painted the town red 
 People fled as I put a dread's head to bed 
 That mean's dead, in other words deceased 
 Face got erased, bullets got released 
 Bombs were planted, the kids were kidnapped 
 In fact that was a way to get back 
 At enemies who tried to clock G's 
 on my block, now they forever knock Z's 
 Plans of rampages went for ages 
 Some got knocked and locked inside cages 
 Some bit the dust for crumbs and crusts 
 In God We Trust, now rots to rust 
 Plus caps to cops, policeman drops 
 You blew off his top when the pistol went pop 
 Troopers, soldiers, rollin like boulders 
 Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder 
 Some young male put in jail 
 His lawyer so good his bail is on sale 
 Lookin at the hourglass, how long can this power last? 
 Longer than my song but he already fell 
 He likes to eat hardy, party 
 Be like John Gotti, and drive a Maserati 
 Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello 
 Mellow, yellow fellow, tell or hell, hello 
 One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate 
 But just stay, ship him upstate by the Great Lakes 
 And than a-wait and wait and wait 
 Til he breaks, that's all it takes 
 So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand 
 On his own two feet because now he's in a new land 
 Rules are different and so is life 
 When you think with a shank, talk with a knife 
 Not my lifestyle so I made a you-turn 
 More money I earn, more money to burn 
 Pushin all buttons, pullin all switches 
 My name is G. Rap, I'm on the road to the riches",Road to the Riches
Kool G Rap,"In the streets of New York
Dope fiends are leaning for morphine
The TV screen followed the homicide scenes
You live here, you're taking a chance
So look and I take one glance, there's a man inside an ambulance
Crowds are getting louder, I wonder how the
People want to go fight for the white powder
People hanging in spots
They waited until the blocks got hot 
And got raided by the cops
I'll explain the man sleeping in the rain
His whole life remains inside a bottle of Night Train
Another man got his clothes in a sack
Cause he spent every dime of his rent playing blackjack
And there's the poor little sister
She has a little baby daughter
Named Sonya and Sonya has pneumonia
So why's her mother in a club unzipped though?
Yo that's her job, Sonya's mommy is a bar stripper
Drug dealers drive around looking hard
Knowing they're sending their brothers and sisters to the graveyard
Every day is a main event, some old lady limps
The pushers and pimps eat shrimps
It gets tiring, the sight of a gun firing
They must desire for the sound of a siren
A bag lady dies in an alleyway
She's seen the last of her days inside the subways
More and more down the slope, the kid couldn't cope
So he stole somebody's dope and a gold rope
Now my son's on the run, he's a wanted one
Had fun then was done by a shotgun
Upstairs I cover my ears and tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
Cause every day of his life he beats his wife
Till one night she decides to pull a butcher knife
Blind man plays the sax
A tune called ?The Arms on My Moms Show Railroad Tracks?
Many lives are cut short
That's when you're living
In the streets of New York

Baby needs new shoes
But his papa uses all the money for booze
A young girl is undressed in the back seat of a Caddy
Calling some man Daddy
Three men slain inside an apartment
All you could see was the sparks when it darkened
Daylight broke, cops roll on the scene
The drug war, daily routine
Gambling spots, just a poor man's jackpot
You winning a lot, you get shot
The drug dealing fanatics
But you don't want no static
Cause they got crack addicts with automatics
Shoot-outs for a desire for territory
A kid got caught in the crossfire
A tired mother can't take no more
She grab the bottle full of sleeping pills and took about 24
Human beings are laying on the pavement
Cause they're a part of a mental enslavement
The cop snipers, little babies in dirty diapers
This type of life is making you hyper
People scouting a torched-out building
And got killed when the cold air filled in
Is hell really suggested?
No more persons arrested, a child molested
A little kid says
""Yo I got a color TV, CD player and car stereo
And all I want is a castle
I also got a .38, don't give me no hassle""
One kid heads straight for the top
And gets stopped and popped by a crooked cop

Kool G Rap,"Yeah here we go, just go with the flow
I wanna say something to this girl I know
She tried to play me out though, check it out

This I dedicate to the girl I hate
It's a piece of my mind rhyme put on a plate
So yo, go ahead swinger, I'm putting up my middle finger
I'm not sad or mad, I don't feel anger
You're not all that fly, trying to play the role
I had girls that looked better on the ho stroll
Working night patrol, ya know what I mean?
I get cash and still wear Jordache jeans
You thought your drug-dealing man was much better
Because he always came and got you in a plush Jetta
Or a Audi, a Benz, or a Jaguar
You didn't think G Rap was going that far
I'm here to tell off, because you thought I fell off
And now if you're riding the tip, just get the hell off
You wanted to leave because you didn't believe that I would achieve
Cause you had something up your sleeve
Perhaps you might have thought I'm a dreamer with a fat head
Now you're stuck with a baby from a crack head
Come to my shows, you want to check it to see if I wreck it
The only record your man got is a jail record
I know you like him a lot because he's a big shot
The only picture you got is his mug shot
I'm on a label with well-known singers in it
Look, your man's getting booked and fingerprinted
Polo drives a Benz from state to stae
By the way, guess who made his license plates
Thought I was finished, down, going through the blues
Here's a hundred dollars, go buy some new shoes
Go ahead good looking, you can keep booking
From my recital I'll never get my title tooken
So you got a little 9 to 5, so what?
What do you do for a living, slice cold cuts?
You look slick, but you know every Tom and Dick
You're more quick than a chick from a porno flick
While you scrub floors, I go on tours
From me, G Rap, yo, truly yours

(Yo G man! You should diss her man. Yo I heard he's a homo anyway)

Listen up money, or should I say honey?
You're looking more sweeter than a Playboy bunny
Fingernails filed, your hair is styled
And the gear that you wear looks hot and wild
Everybody says is he, some kind of sissy?
Your name was ""Moose"" but now they call you ""Missy""
Night or day lights, you fight for the gay rights
I thought you would stay bright, but you wanna play fight
With men, and Len, your real close friend
But you wouldn't be his friend if his knees didn't bend
You're not a lady dear, you're a square and a queer
Barrettes in your hair, bamboos in your ear
Running to cars, hanging out in gay bars
Winking your eyes to guys that wear bras
Skintight Levi's and even knee-highs
Don't try to lie, sugar, I know why
In the ladies bathroom, spraying on perfume
Stuffing your t-shirt with two balloons
You don't think about the opposite sex at all
Instead of sugar walls, you'd rather have the balls
Way back in the days, you was as big as a cow
But look at you now, at jams you say ""Ow!""
A sex disease was as common as TB
But gays today get VD in 3-D
And that is called AIDS in case you didn't know
And the only blow I'm giving is this knockout blow
Switching with your bandana looking like Diana Ross
From me G Rap, yo, truly yours

(Hey yo, finish dissing that girl, man)

Yo, do me a favor, and pick up a pen and pad
And try to write down the numbers of the men you've had
So remember when you're putting someone else in check
Go to the Wizard of Oz and get some self-respect
Won't say no names, it might leave a permanent scar
I don't have to go that far, you know who you are
And if you don't, then everybody else does
Cause all the fellas be telling me how good you was
I can't accept a girl with a ruined rep
I'm like a chef, I just cook up the stew and step
Off with her clothes, like Moby Dick, there she blows
She wanna throw like the girls from the peep shows
Your man was large, but now he's getting kinda tiny
And you run up behind me trying to get pregnant by me
And in a year, I bet you'll be on welfare
Don't cry for help dear, you put yourself there
The way it looks, you'll end up in Playboy books
While your man is in Manhattan snatching pocket books
Bugging and mugging with a big 12 gauge
Starving so bad I can see his ribcage
Yo, you used to tell me all the time you're gonna be a model
Later in life, you're living in a crack bottle
So when you're begging on your knees because I'm clocking G's
You'll be in zero degrees getting processed cheese
Wearing dungarees, yo baby I don't need a girl with broken hands
Cause her man's a woman beater
So when you getting sores from giving up your drawers
Remember Kool G Rap said truly yours

Yo, I don't even know why you tried to play me honey
Now I'm down with Warner Brothers getting Bugs Bunny money

Kool G Rap,"She tossed the flamer '94 walked into danger
Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back on the street, back on her feet
Clappin' the heat

She's dressed to kill
Iced-out head to toe, a snake in black
She's cleared, to, get ill
She's about the dough, the black widow

Yo, she was a tight bird, female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves, beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the herb, rockin' all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shine of her light blurs from off her finger
Honey was off the ringer, the way she tossed the flamer
'94 walked into danger, behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back to the street, back on her feet
Clappin' the heat, from the back seat, in back of a jeep
Stackin' the heat, pilin' the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence a Dunn
Convoys of black limos
Employs strapped with mack millos
Bustin' off caps through a cracked window, that's the MO
Push your wig back, make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin' to map the dividend flow, and where the ends go
Checkin' on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when Mac-10's blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web, killin' for blood spill, a black widow

[Chorus]
She's (out for blood) dressed (for the kill) to kill (bustin' slugs)
Iced-out (shit is real) head (livin' crime) to toe (life of crime)
A snake (droppin' heads) in black (pullin' nines)
She's cleared (dodgin' heat) to (play the street)
Get ill (let the guns blow, had to eat)
She's about (copped the raw) the dough (went to war)
The black widow (beef no more, cold fours at your door)

She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto, kiddo
Step out of line, kitko, she spit nines and shi-dells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put em in line piddles
Diamond-stud shinin' the clito', the web spinnin'
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom, known for bustin' the lead grinnin', tilted red brimmin'
Makin' the lights inside of your head dimmin'
Givin' head to men and, leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in, foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen, sippin' gin with a shread of lemon
Dead-up thoroughbred, slim and trim and stackin cake like Emminger's
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins, for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular, hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola, mezzanine she's with binoculars
You even think about poppin' her, stoppin' her, moppin' her, droppin' her
Hard with bodyguards divin' on top of her
Cops in they Blu-Blockers watchin' her, steady clockin her
Jock her, dreamin' of knockin' her, thinkin' a scheme for knockin' her
Dress provocative, show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though, restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow, strike of the black widow

[Chorus]

She held a white weddin'
Type settin' just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the bread'n from her last rice on her head'n
All types of presents, striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons, ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles, took vows
With all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggaz' necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin' her central book files
Beef them niggaz cook wild, groom lookin shook style
Forced into marriage, horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average, lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem, makin' her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed, first class, Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots, smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin' experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin' in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down, holdin' her shirt gaspin', hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin; the facts are real, though
Got her cap peeled for stackin' real dough

But that don't stop nuttin' cause trust me the cop's duckin'
A badge don't mean shit, when the glocks is gunnin'
And I don't think the pig's tryin to get, popped in the stomach

Bust down a mill' with the click, ill with the chicks
Wheelin' the six to cribs on hills in the sticks

Used ta, reel in the chips, slangin' krills on the strip
Now we, spillin' the Crist', niggaz still with the hits
Won't stop until I cop a half-a-mill' for the wrist
Rule with a iron fist but still in the midst
G Rap and his squad of guerillas, carve your grill up
Harsh killer hold the hammer like twenty bar villains
Spit flames like Godzilla, menage-a-trois in large villas
Pack the trey-pound God pealer
It's a hard thriller mob chiller
Decide your fate like a Tarot card dealer
Y'all niggaz is yard squealers; play around and be a scar feeler
A shot down man on the tar feeler chick witchu the gem star spiller

No one survives with a shy gun inside slums

Gettin' the news that's tragic, feuds are graphic

Break any rules you lose your attic
Who's in the habit of usin' the static
Make somethin' ooze out your cabbage
When dudes with ratchets, can pay your dues
Stools on the mattress, bruised and battered
Blown out your shoes and your fabrics
With Jakes searchin' for clues and maggots
My crew is savage, we carry no dead weight
Bet they hide you when I slide kid
All my tools is packaged, and lose you faggots
Stay coppin' them jewels with karats, so who's the rabbit
Trix are for kids, in the buggy eye six on the strip
Strictly for big wigs, so tell me what this is

A nigga that don't renege, a nigga that bust a cig, rupture your ribs

That's what an evil man's plan'll do
Vandal you, candle you, dismantle you
Leavin' your fam and crew, pan a few blocks
Bodies in camera view, for a grand or two
Land you on channel two
When niggaz can't eat, that's what the fam'll do
Leave you for the mantle, examine you
For the van to come transfer you
Too late to bandage you, too much damage to you
The coroners know how to manage you
Down in they land they planted you
That's what the cannons do, forever branded you
Spare cannoned you, abandoned you, rock you to sleep
Niggaz surrounded you, death wish granted you, fan at you
Went to my hundred shot clip when they flip and throw a grand at you
Peel your shit open like a can of brew
Then they work from the mandible, havin' you livin' where the salmon do
The good die young, redrum, who left to take a stand for you

You cock a hot bet (?) and catch a popped vessel
And shot vestibule; you got testicles
Beef bring a nigga get shot visible
Rock with the best of you; then it's back to the block
The blacktops we open up shop and clock decimals
Fake cops, scrape from the teeth hot for residue
The foul slang liver(?) page, reach for that shit on your waist
Every killer in the place get hit in the face
Turn around, simmer down nigga, get in the safe
What you fear when the shots is blowin; shed a tear for the one
that caught one under the ear inside of his top popped open
It's death for all niggaz that left with the glock smokin
Came in with hot toast and left the whole spot soakin'
Fuck y'all niggaz not knowin', we make your seeds stop growin'

We mob in it, fake niggaz dissolve in minutes

Even hoes on the low at the shows lose it
Courvoisier-sippin, this slim nigga stay flippin
My ways different, duck when the AK spittin
It's more to it, verbal wisely, all fluent
In real life this is how the dogs do it

Found from bloodhound nasals
Or deep in the river get found naval

""American Me"" style, knife in the anal; who 'round to save you?
I leave you from waist down disabled
Face split like a round bagel
Found in a hospital gown witcha crown stapled
Wrong one to tangle with, a gym star, spangle your shit
Use your handkerchief to strangle your bitch
Single niggaz out on the strip and bang in a clip
Slugs from a Desert Eagle mingle the click
A force of habit, for me to let it rip across your attic
Never violent with a silent but I toss your cabbage

With two mamis handin' me thrills; Vivica Fox body Vanity grills
Rubberbandin' these bills; tryin' to duck the fame and the glamor
Tryin' to stay from out the range of the scanners
Not tryin' to get my frame in the camera
Avoid tabloids and front pages
Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges

Got homicide searchin' the city dump for neighbors

Copped a spot with a bunch of acres

Listen, if you goin out of town and don't bear them gats
It ain't where you from, kid, it's where you at
If you caught up in a beef and you scared to clap
Dogs, it ain't where you from, it's where you at

Shit, thug listen (What up baby?)
Ain't nothin' 'round here but drug addiction
Niggas is anti-love-livin
The slug-givin' little shortie on the snub itchin'
For beef, he might get left in the street with his blood drippin'
The poor niggas sling crack, real raw niggas that bang gats
Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks
Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that
Them kids is live, put five where your brain at
You walk the streets of the slums
Know to spot beef when it come
Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones
Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one)
Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung
Leak em and run, some guys light the blunts up
(And then what?) And then go ride with the pumps up
Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster
Paramedics tryin' to speed a nigga pulse up
(Yo, he's a cold blue) victim of the vultures
Block sizzlin' hot, flooded in the middle with cops
Innocent nigga topped, riddled with shots
Kids up in rock spots clock knots, fiddle with glocks
Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right)
The ones that put holes in mugs
Waitin' outside for them ones that pose in clubs
To that strange nigga knockin' on your do' with gloves
Let the .44 blow for grub, it's no love

[Chorus]

You got uniformed cops, the D's when it's hot
TNT knockin' down the door of your spot
The feds come get you once you think you on top
They just been buildin' they case, they got you on tape
The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your money's that long, you ain't that strong
Informants'll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin' just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this
Plus stick-up kids and jealous-ass niggas
You gotta watch your front, sides and your back (Damn)
You gotta keep your eyes on your bitch and your mens
You gotta keep your mind sharp livin' so fed

(Bitch) 
Yeah bitch 
No more Mister Nice Guy 
y'all bitches check this shit out right here now 
Word up baby 
No more Mister Nice Guy 
Fuck all the bullshit 
Fuck all that nice shit 
No more Mister Nice Guy 

(You are not the sensitive man you used to be) 
I used to be romantic and considerate 
But now I hit the skins I jump right in, and then get rid of it 
Cause I remember when you used to treat me like a stepson 
You hung around for fun but yo, I wasn't gettin wet none 
Treated you like you was a star big as Madonna 
I took you out on dates to go eat steaks at Benny Harner's 
I called you on the telephone to see what you was doin 
Took a trip to the zoo and bulls were steady tryina do it 
??? but I didn't get my rocks off 
Talkin bout knockin boots, I didn't even get your socks off 
Tryin everything inside the book to get you naked 
I guess the candlelight dinners and Spinners records didn't make it 
But yo, I'm still ringin your bell holdin roses 
We might as well been Eskimos in clothes rubbin noses 
I woulda gave you stars from out the sky 
But soon as I got the pie 
Poof - no more Mister Nice Guy 

(You bitch) 
Bitch you're actin real funny with your pussy 
Yeah bitch 
No more Mister Nice Guy 
Bitch I been waitin for like a fuckin month and a half

What's the problem? 
Fuck that shit 
No more Mister Nice Guy 
Fuck you and your pussy 
(Bitch) 
(Ah yeah) 
(What's the matter, you're burning?) 

Thinkin bout the times I opened doors and pulled your chair out 
But now I got you stressed, lookin a mess pullin your hair out 
I used to come and shower you with mad flowers and candies 
But all that shit stopped when I got into the panties 
Now you're steady beggin me to bang her 
I come to bust a nut off of a blow job or fuck you with my finger 
Before I got the cunt I was your little rubber-duckie 
But now you see me three times a month if you're lucky 
I used to buy you clothes as we doze in a pocanose 
Now you're gettin called all kinda hoes and a broken nose 
Took you out for movies and dinner 
Now I pack a snack and rent a blockbuster tape and run up in ya 
Before I woulda done anything to see you nude 
Now you ??? hump or gotta nease noff like Ebeneezer Scrooge 
It ain't no more pickin you up dressed out in a suit and tie 
Bitch, no more Mister Nice Guy 

Bitch, I'm tellin you right now 
It wasn't all that 
Aw fuck you 
I don't want it no more 
Suck my dick 
Fuck your pussy 
This stinks 

When we first went to bed I used to leave your head spinnin 
But now I hit quick and give a speed stick while in it 
Yeah, I used flip you like Jack the Ripper the stripper 
Now I'm ready to date when I get lipstick on my zipper 
Just give me a cut, and all of a sudden 
I'm steady (nuttin) (nuttin) right on your shirt buttons 
So get a grip as my tip starts to sprinkle 
It drips from your lip to your hip to your ankle 
And that's for all the times you used to try to play me, baby 
My name ain't Miss Daisy, but thanks for the ride, lady 
Because you rode me like a hoe inside a rodeo 
And now the nitwit is moby dick-whipped like Toby-o 
I wish you would light a cigarette that I chain smoke 
The only coat i be puttin on is my raincoat 
I used to treat the hookers flier than sky high 
But now I'm a wise guy, no more Mister Nice Guy 

(You bitch) 
Now I hope you bitches understand 
I tried to tell you bitches 
Suck my dick 
Suck my dick 
Fuck all you bitches 
Fuck y'all 
No more Mister Nice Guy 
Suck my dick and suck my nipple 
Suck all our dicks bitch 
Fuck you 

No more Mister Nice Guy 
I don't give a fuck no more bitch, now I'm maaaad 
No more Mister Nice Guy 
Come on, you bitches 

Fuck that bitch 
I'm really mad now 
I'm telling you 
You really got me pissed off 
I can't have the pussy no more? 
Fuck that bitch 
Even if I have to take it 
Don't make me take it

Kool G Rap,"The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A.
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

Champagne wishes of caviar dreams ?a penis didn't cream?
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin' the live of rowdy packin' fifty cali's
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin' beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count mad for seen bad
We've seen a half a milli dashin' out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Domateus
Fakers get used to shootin' targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll stray pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin' straight crimy in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta come get through a whole army
The celo rollers money folders sippin' bola holdin' mad payola
Slangin' a Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son

[Repeat x2]
Livin' the fast life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream

Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggaz be
The ghetto misery, shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lex over who's petrol
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots, holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallaby down
Twenty-four carats, countin' cabbage, like the Arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin' Guinness shootin' catchin' cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The Luciano Frankie Aiel, Bugsy Seagal
Green papers with eagles from a tray that's illegal

Brother you've got to make it happen
Yeah yeah, get this money, yeah
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, hey yeah yeah

Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
It's choir attire standin' on ground with one pivot
Two players rockin' silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
Lands with name brand seats reclinin' like in spaceships
Bodies on ice
Livin' trife, rollin' fixed up dice
Gamblin' Grants
Handlin' stamps
Moves are sheist
My bankrolls, got the cops comin' in plain clothes
Tryin' to arraign again cause of our fame that's how the game goes
True
Right out the slammer with the fame and glamor
Cookin' up grams with Arm & Hammer supplyin' scramblers in Alabama
Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin' us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin' in cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin' sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites, deep, rippin' beats with flows
Aiyyo, we went from standin' on blocks, without some socks
Sellin' rocks, to pickin' up stock and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin' all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

Shit ain't never gonna change... Fuck it! 
Time to load the clips, then we take 'em to war. 
Niggaz want to flip, then we take 'em to war. 
Break a nigga proper, then we break him some more. 

I represent the murderers and felony offenders,
Who either bought time out, to get these legal tenders.
(Surrender!) Nah, I'm goin' out with a bang, nigga.
Fuck Pataki, I gotta do my thang, nigga.
Forty-four mag, bustin' into action.
Brains left in particles, fragments and fractions.
Grimm, the money stacker, heat packer.
I'm lurkin', I'm waitin', attackin' like a linebacker. 
Fuck what you heard, crime pays.
And always, unorthodox, I hold my pistol sideways.
We kill crews, hearts go numb,
And if retaliation comes then yo, fuck it, it just comes.
(Yo, who you?) I'm Dr. Death, motherfucker, ever heard of me? 
Close your eyes, cross your fingers, time for surgery.
I'm already dead, so nah, you can't murder me,
'Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly.

[Chorus x 2]

Since I murder for hire, rapid fire's what I require.
Makin' niggaz perspire, so send a message through the wire.
'Cause violence is contagious, it got me bustin' gauges.
The '95 Larry Davis, and I'm wettin' niggaz for wages.
Queens is the home of one, the known felon,
And ain't no tellin', when I'm a crack your fuckin' melon.
For the right amount of chips, I spit clips and hit whips.
Leavin' niggaz bloody, the leather seats is where the shit drips.
With the pound-seven, I be creepin', rockin' niggaz, while they sleepin'.
Shots repeatin', leavin' faggot niggaz leakin'.
When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin', marchin' to Zion.
'Cause the pound-cake, roars like a lion.
Word, son, niggaz be collapsin', cause my weapons is
Ready for action, makin' your heart catch contractions.
In the underworld, shootin' gallery niggaz lose calories,
'Cause my salary's based on fatalities.

[Chorus x 2]
 
Here I come to get some motherfuckin' wreck, but first I gotta, 
Um, vest check, uncheck, clip one check, clip two check, I'm set.
So let a motherfucker move a muscle.
When I tussle, they'll be piecin' niggaz back like fuckin' puzzles.
'Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin' mad noise, a bad boy.
When I was younger, always carried guns, I never had toys.
Grimm, gimme the infrared, they see me, and I'm puttin' red dots
On niggaz foreheads, to makin' motherfuckers indian.
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder. 
'Cause I put holes in my beef, like fuckin' White Castle burgers.
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo' pound.
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down.
I see 'em, he's comin' out the fuckin' Coliseum,
And hopped into a B-M, shit! 
Put in my clip, and then I dipped into the ride that my man had, 
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide.
I'm rainin' on him, (faster nigga.) oh yeah, we're gainin' on him.
(Oh shit, he's with somebody else.)  Fuck it, put his brain on him.
Boom, boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat.
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver.
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin' up a cigarette.
Bang, bang, I left the other nigga wet.

I split your fuckin top and leave a fingerprint on purpose.",Take Em to War

Brown-skin fine, I drink her body like wine 

and throw the wax on it, and watch two cheeks shine 

I drunk a forty, I'm up in here feelin naughty 

I like the go-go girl, go 'head work it shorty

I gave her cream, and rubbed it on her black boots

I gotta peel for real, a hundred dollar bill 

I'm comin straight up, and not for a breakfast meal 

This ain't no Burger King, this ain't no White Castle

Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline

Put niggaz in fear  the bullets in they head section 
Pick up drug dollars  leave rings around niggaz collars 
Front me cash  you catch them bodies  put em in a stash 
Never laugh at you  explain plans  what to do 
Machine guns on tour, pajama for your soft crew 
Don't step to me with shit the candle wax is gettin lit 
I'm solo now, and still money I have to fuckin split 
Business ain't straight in glamour world, fuckin hellgate 
All these things I been through, your skull deserves a metal plates 
Not the platinum plaque, just gun staples in your back 
Hung from a tree with rusty nails in your rectum crack

Then shift flop first, and now it's time that you work this 
Suck my ass, we pass on acts if you think they good 
Niggaz ain't platinum, they album still, went barely wood 
I bring your ? down, samples now you have to clear it 
Niggaz talkin shit like lyric records, I ain't tryin to hear it 
Even if I'm deaf no mouth, one fuckin ear left 
You think they worth investments, hold your fuckin breath 
You might as well bite Kane, Rakim, study G. Rap 
I got some new shit, mental secrets for yo' asscrack 
Let me get real, before that ass breach that contract 
I got witnesses watchin, statements over budget 
Don't try to hide behind that fuckin mask now 
Throw the pistols away, and hide the shit in the grass now

With child support, I drag your coffins in the court 
We even Steven, fuck that, my time and rent is short 
I've been writin songs, I'm calm, I'm a good sport 
One year has gone by, with tecs jam up in your eye 
I'm on some clever shit, fuck it man, go 'head lie

You know my flavor, lubricated bareback 

Stroke to get live, you melt down, when I tap the sack 

Like Kojak, detective, I got your contraceptive 

I know your perspective, if you get picked, I'm selective 

Rubbin you down, in baths, Calgon bound 

You lookin sexy smilin, in that soft nightgown 

Baby love it when I blow bubbles, kiss her stomach

The lady is ready, tell Duke I'ma rock her steady 



Lovely lady, girl you drive me crazy (3X) 



Tight BM, she want to give me her W 

Take me shoppin, do what I want to, do it when I want to do 

I play the game right, work out that back tonight 

Disco lights beam, dancin at Southside 

She got her lingerie on, sippin on ? 

Emotional status, I'm puttin tongues to the baddest 

Bitin the peaches, cherries open on the beaches 

I got her turned out, screamin in the bleachers 

Eatin ?, her friends are mad gettin jealous 

Blockin my great view, some knucklehead's down too 

Who is it Wizard? I got the address I'ma visit 

Go down solo, she workin night, at the GoGo 

New York City Ampex, she pays for my reels 

She's admire me, her pockets with tons of bills 

She lookin good comin from work 

I hope she bought me a pair of them expensive ? reels

Boots and thongs, girls flip on my theme songs 
They know I damage, with gloves my equipment's on 
I got a cape, like Superman, I'ma put it on

Prepared to take us, anywhere, tonight's the Grammy's 
After party back at the hotel, we're poppin' expensive Perignon 
I'm the suave Don, this is the average evening 
Of the celebrities, the days are relaxed 
It would seem to most, an expensive vacation package 
The pay is good, in Hollywood

All excited over these football players and baseball players 

Whassup? You lookin for a million dollars or somethin? 

Man you kinda confused 



Freak mode! I'ma have sex  so let em feel 

Touch my private  my thing made of steel 

Shootin gizm  she ride like a Geo Prism 

I'm out in Cali  San Bernardino Valley 

I'm on the hill, not North in Peteskill 

Big Willie servin, now tell me how you femmes feel 

I'm in the Cadillac, drivin in a droptop 

People don't know my style, watch when they heads bop 

I'm on the highway, girls pull em down my way 

Credit cards and checks, man she get paid on Friday 

The woman's out, the Phantom pushin more clout 

I'm watchin ? with Sam, drinkin Guinness Stout 

Bourban booze, green alligator shoes 

Union commissioned sex, government intelligence 

What you see girl, that Benz is irrelevant 

Materialistic, ugly man is plastic 

No class, in a suit, cost rather cheap 

Got the nerve to blow the horn and he try to beep 

Interfere, in my spot, and he's comin here 

She's in the white boots, breathin in my ear

Worldwide trunk funk, no jazz on the East 

Breakin honies down, mackin here to Petersberg 

Virginia Slim, turn the freaks out in Lynchburg 

With brown bootie, Joe Smith, hit from Pittsburgh 

The right player, even if I choose odds 

Let me shuffle jackpots, women pick the cards 

Your hydraulic butt, bounce like a six-trey 

I'm on the case, jealous man steppin in my way 

Hot pursuit, why she play herself? Get the boot 

Actin like Troop, he say he signed with a group 

He wrote for Babyface, did songs, toured with Snoop 

.. lyin to you to get thrilled 

Droppin them old lines, his breath smell like doodoo 

I got a style if a brother want to know 

Smokin that stink blunt, you still sniffin blow 

Nose runnin on time with green slime 

Step in the club, I throw urine on your mind 

Big Luciano, diamond rings on the grand piano 

Girls flock and guys hop on the other jock 

I'm in a two-door, with bass comin through your block 

Sound kicks, I got the fly broads in the mix 

California butt, MC's suckin more what 

Like Gerald Levert, you try to make it work 

Jheri Curl Jones, spendin cash on a skirt 

Plan to win, whassup with Uncle Ben? 

Brother is sly, fatback bacon 

Still fakin, his voice chords achin 

You know I'm perplex, exotic on Ampex 

Dogstyle champ, hittin booty for butt sex 

I can't disguise myself like Michael Jackson

I got a summons, my clothes is off, I'm butt-naked 

in a discotechque, don't tell me ladies can't take it 

Just to have my drawers in a overcoat 

My El Dorado lean, the black Caddy float 

down the hill with Frankie Dolla Bill 

Honies in red zone, tell me how them drawers feel 

Suckin on the hippie, on the Mississippi 

Econo Lodge, a cheap way to get a quickie 

Five and five, equal ten 

Add twenty up, I'm back in the spot again 

Blowin it up, I drop my own bomb 

Two big green mitts, and tails on my arm 

You in my way my man, yo be	 excuse me 

I didn't call your girl, why accuse me? 

I think you're insecure, not sure 

if your girlfriend's home, if she's knockin at my door 

Back in your ride, no apartment, no place to wash 

You can't clean, tell em black 

He don't know yet, my discipline, how to act 

Stack with fume, and twenty-four flicks 

You can't win, takin shots like the Knicks 

I'm old enough with skills to be your daddy 

Go ask grandma, your freaky Aunt Sally 

Pretty woman standin there with her ugly man 

I don't want to shake his hand

Kool Keith,"Yeah  cool Keith should keep it real 
He should rap about space and Mars... 
 
Yo  I'm tired of looking at everybody. Same boots, skully hats in 
90 degree weather looking to get into clubs for free. I'm not 
smoking blunts or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt. 

I left New York the city itself was stress depression 
High boots and urban beats  that wasn't my direction 
Producers filtering join in with R&B 
A million rappers, some clones trying to sound like me 
Biting my space styles, biting my horror-core 
All I saw was cool Keiths on my thaw 
Record companies had G'd-off all my royalties 
Watching vinyl spin, local groups' wack MC's 
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap 
Karl Kani jeans, fat stomachs in the limousines 
Mixtapes by wack DJs adds doo doo play 
I'm on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway 
Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion 
On videos out of town, peoples buy confusion 
Rolling high with cash pulled over down my eye 
Since I've been out, y'all can't see 

[Chorus:]
Is the world made of plastic? 
Is the city buried in dreams? (Yeah) 
Is the world made of plastic? 
Cause that's the way is seems (Owww) 

Watching TV so bored, while imbeciles hold the mic cord 
Graffiti playgrounds are played out, yo how'd that sound? 
Army fatigues are weak, is for the minor leagues 
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented Benz 
Crews on stage, acting hard with a thousand friends 
I saw the place turn plastic, crackers looping beats 
People with no deals, walkmen rappin' on the streets 
I turned my back, 90% of the city sounded wack 
Payola scams switched DJ's like a rubber band 
Everybody clear with beats trying to be Premier 
Clearing samples, your SP-12 fake examples 
My money grows with green from my own label 
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label 
Your tri-state ways are shut down by barricades 
In fact I packed my bags, and listened to E-40 
Mac Mall, see-Bo, and other rappers you don't know 
You're narrow-minded and styles of mind you won't find it 
My sound proceeds with moog and undertone bass 
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face 
I come back real, solid rock razor steel 
Tap your program, show the world I'm the man 
You copy Poppa Large, the industry is large 

[Chorus]

[Chorus

As I do see sorta rugged wack beer commercials 
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles 
From Manhattan I heat up, yo light up Times Square
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare 
No promotional shows, girls wear corn rows 
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes 
I walk with straw hats, fake glasses in the projects 
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage 
Playing my numbers, waiting for the Five to come 
Spaghetti out the window, people acting dumb 
Fire hazards wake the neighbors, your family's nosy 
I come and go as I please on blockhead MC's 
You bought new sneakers, no car, scrambling on the corner 
I'm not the star you are, the city's fallen far 
By mechanism, you're on my tip 
Stay off my penis, you've duplicated me for years 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are the one

Kool Keith,"Yo money 
Yeah whassup cool Keith? 
Yo that girl Kadiva gon' come to your house 
With, blonde hair and boots 
Tell her rent a cheap room on Sunset Boulevard 
For $16.95 I ain't tryin to get no Madrian no Marriott 
Or all that higher stuff 
Yo we can go on cheaper man 
I know somethin for like $10.99 man 
It's a hotel with roaches in it and everything 
It's almost near skid row  

Buttnaked! Girls walk Sunset with they ass out 
I start Cadillacs with suits, wear my mask out 
With brims tilted, I finger pop the whole block 
Make freaks wear wigs, and put the rubbres on my cock 
You see me out there, with big balls like Rosie Grier 
Players cream, I pull panties out your wet dreams 
Get deep in cracks, and wash em out like Mr. Clean 
Bring your Massengil, the public think I'm very ill 
Like Jimmy Z, posin naked for the FCC 
I'm not no basketball star, your girl watch me pee 
Clock me like cops, every time my sperm drops 
She's in my face with thongs, chewin lollipops 
I'll hit that butt on the low, just like Monica 
Play three tunes and let her blow on my harmonica 
I'm out here, you rollin fake in Union Square 
I'll make you go blonde, brunettes runnin down they hair 

[Chorus: x2] 

Regular girl, is so boring (get out my face) 
Regular girl, you never turn me on (work the latex) 

You saw my porno flick, nutsacs banged up on your TV 
Your girl pulled her panties off real quick, tryin to see me 
She wants an autograph, a part with my anal staff 
You scream test for AIDS, stretch marks make me laugh 
Sign your contracts for Willie, smoke a big Phillie 
I'm too old for young girls, gigglin' actin' silly 
I'm Sugar Daddy, your aunt gon' be worried duke 
Your moms at my hotel, her bra is real cute 
Dressed in G-strings, she's scopin' me, eatin' fruit 
She licked my balls, I came like Niagara Falls 
Brought her tittes to Prince show instead of Lou Rawls 
Her pelvis grind, she smile show me pantylines 
I'll smack that butt, the pro spank at different times 
Like Max? hardcore ? it's on the dirty floor 
Make you scream for stiff rods, you don't want no more 
Penetration, I don't do that on your menustration 
I want movies back, you smile, addin' lubrication 
You know your steelo, orgies doin' three people 
Kodak action, Black Tail, butt satisfaction 
You lookin' good sweet cheeks

[Chorus] 

I turned the Lakers off, you can't stop my afterparty 
A fifth of vodka, and latex, drink your Bacardi 
I serve it well through tubes and watch your rectum swell 
Service your clits with steel, machines keep it real 
Got that ramrod, that's pumpin through your back hard 
You be seein' cum stains on Sunset Boulevard 
My rubber send streaks and heels off your girl's feets 
You not psychadelic wimp, I'm still your girl's pimp 
That's part interest, magnificent, mind power 
I got nuts that clean kill, let me take my shower 
Wash off my pubic, and let the females do my nails 
Watch naked legs in chairs and enter soft tails 
Wear stockin' caps with maps and shoft for soft cracks 
Lift off your hairpeace, while milk squirts up on your weave 
You know my skin needs butter, your cheeks are popcorn 
I get deep, go run in butt like the unicorn 
Rodeo anus banger, quick with the middle finger 
Her tampons drop down between her Maxi 
I left tips for cocked up legs in the taxi 
Yo take her home cab driver, here's her panties

Sticking piped in your ass until you stop the freesyle drama 

I pioneered this shit, you keep sucking dick 

Your girl's in the crowd, hawking me for a naked flick 

I got my silk underwear for the atmosphere 

Piss in your face and urinate all in your hair 

You name a group that's shit, I will pooper-scoop 

Fuck with this, miss, I will damage on the premesis 

Niggas step back with Dax grease, watch their ass twist 

I rhyme any nigga, golden showers up in Greek Alley 

Movie star bitches, MC's lining up in Cali 

Drinking vodka, Absolut, sipping Tanqueray 

Mc's jump off, I stung your rectum like a stingray 

Girls heinie-wipe, MC's say my style is hype

Could rob a horse, pull your panties off and pay the cost

I don't care who your are, and if you think you're famous 

You could be waxed, seventy-five fucking rap groups

Like Shan said  I pioneered this 

And I'ma let you have it 



Super status  structure  lyrically the baddest 

No time to perpetrate on front street  I rock the fattest 

Ultimate ego  your rap style  sounds feeble 

Bionic black man  crowd packed with tons of people 

No one the equal, should grab the mic, stop my sequel 

Purchase your ticket, I been here since Wilson Pickett 

Shut off your rap dream, career's over, that's on high beam 

You on the trampoline learnin, you still concernin 

I burn your index, spray your raps like they insects 

I want that action

Got your mom believin the label clown pick your room up

I pull your charter from the blind side, to the start up 

There'll be no star, pull them stickers off your rented car 

Your man is playin also, a fake mafioso 

His rap is so-so, I'm warmed up like chocolate cocoa 

Who you know go? Get that kid, off your promo 

I move like Marko, New York City think I'm Cuomo 

You sayin, ""Oh no, Keith is droppin big solo""

Catch you out there, with mic stands, cords in yo' hand 

Youse a first year rookie, duplicatin Method Man

Servin headwork, new MC's, watch your neck jerk 

I'm such an expert, I pull you quick, stop your concert 

I drop my interludes sharp now, words and inserts 

Back your face up, while sound man, turn the bass up 

You wearin makeup, your skirt is short, sippin a quart 

You think you're hardcore? You're opposite, rappin softcore 

Kickin metaphor with zeroes, I give you a score

Yo my life is clientele while pro people talk about me 
Cut empty pocket  shark faces like electric sockets 
Sideburns with afro  nasty pro  throw like Rollo 
In Wells Fargo  cashin' checks while you tryin to borrow 
My game is cut through  plastic come, we can see through 
disco music, jazz loops, I ain't tryin' to be you 
Nineteen-ninety-nine, 2000 black, new design 
My head is on right 
Back up kid you wasn't born right 
Playin' center I block your wack raps like Bill Cartwright 
Pick up your rebounds, plastic soft production sounds 
All MC groups will be cartoons like Mother Goose 
No joke I bust back 
Kid for real, watch your buttcrack 
Entourages, movin' neighborhoods like Mr. Rogers 
Slam rhymes on concrete, mash em up in car garages 
Cadillac spin, open magazines, Vibe again 
You're jealous stare lickin', paws like you're Rin-Tin-Tin 
I'm back again, I stop your programs like Gentle Ben

I come to boo you, best believe, I'm a damager 
Cancel shows, interviews, I don't need no manager 
Slash fan, half of y'all, think I'm the Elephant Man 
Look through my records analyze me like I'm Michael Jackson 
Collect my vinyl DJ moves spinnin' on my wax and 
groupies in line, camera flashes, I don't need the action 
Sweaty hotels, dumbbells, I'd rather shop in Modell's 
while y'all wear backpacks, with corny macks, rollin L's 
CD's get melted, ask your favorite rapper, how he felt it 
I turn on others, light up this, when I'm cookin' muffins 
That's on the grill, make your girlfriend buy my Ampex reels 
Pay for studio time, droppin' verse with dope words 
I'm on the real herb, pick up mics you got some nerve 
Rahway State Prison bring my projects in the music business 
That's if you with this, yo Craig, there will be no witness

Walk in giant arenas and stop your show at Madison Square 
With security, you can't call the Secret Service 
Got your roadie cases packed up, your bookin' agent nervous 
Backstage passes special units break your Fendi glasses 
Cancel your flights, Town Car, see me in the brown car 
Rip up your passport, I follow you through Kennedy airport 
Lock up the gates, town seize up, like Norman Bates

I pack clubs; promoters put me out in Tokyo 
Damage your area; I'm a launch a fierce missile 
I roll schools, movin' butt like I'm toilet tissue 
What is your issue? You over, man; I don't miss you 
Scottie soft, you play like Jan Van Breda Kolff 
New Jersey Nets real man; you ain't no Donald Hillman 
Bald head like Slick Watts, I run rap like Mayor Koch 
Forward your info while Tony Lou crank the Benzo 
Move out your driveway; white girls look, turn they eye away 
Jealous in fact, tryin' to rip the capes off my back 
I move with calm and potential through instrumentals 
Y'all front on BET with slum gold, drivin' rentals 
I get real dino, runnin' groups like a rhino 
Endin' careers - that's my job; yo, your rap is final 
Cancel your in-stores; your new job is moppin' floors 
Fixin' tiles, stoppin' potholes up on the roof 
You work for service 
No tips, man, I speak the truth 

[Chorus]

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed 
MTV level three when I fly on BET 
Livin' astro; tell me how you feel 
One two, one two, one two 

Pull your hoods down; I bum rush your after party 
Have your manager scared, the radio station say I'm sorry 
Pack your bags; I move my luggage to the coliseum 
Infinite prime piece with statues in the rock museum 
Changin' my zones, drinkin' cocktails on cellular phones 
I tour with Anthrax through Texas with the Rolling Stones 
Booked by the agency, famous artists payin' me 
Hotels with fly room, with sneakers starin' at the moon 
Mad atmosphere, ridin' first class on British Air 
Lobster and steak while y'all back in time doin' remakes 
I'm futuristic, nine-nine to the year four thousand
I make announcements, drop skills, then I bounce with 
Fly young ladies, AMG kicks, 2000 Mercedes 
Brand new models, only seen one in Colorado 
Light green metallic in the Shark Bar eatin' salad 
Lorenzo Wills, valet park, shoppin' in Beverly Hills 
Step up your wildest spaceship, kid, in the Plymouth Prowler 
Comin' down

Kool Keith,"Blast full at ten, Keith still solo with no manager 
Them lock out, studios, need to block out 
Here's my number call me direct, get no feedback 
No interviews, channel four, see me on the news 
Erase your message walk streets with my cellular phone 
Address you wonder, don't try to catch me home alone 
Up seven o'clock, while you trying to find me on my block 
I'm at the airport, you think I'm strange, boardin' the plane 
Turn off my pager, then quickly, relax my feet 
Hotel Onion drinkin' brew watchin' Sesame Street 
You thought you saw me with a wig on, at 7/11 
Disguised like Shakespeare with blue chrome behind your ear 
My George Washington robe, I still travel the globe 
On Pan-Am air flights, I roll in cities after midnight 
Stand in your lobby unsuspected, you get neglected 
Traffic was hectic

Order room service, transfer quick to Holiday Inn 
Check out time nine o'clock, coat on, I'm on again 
You comin' so wack you sound like the Bulworth soundtrack 
I'm in the mall steady shoppin' while you tryin' to call 
It's on my answering machine, to speak to me as a dream 
Pacific Bell know him, the phone is off, and I'm well known 
1-800 number, castle code see to summer 
Extreme complicated businessman, can't be reached 
No type of headquarters, deserted land, by the waters 
Target my focus on, internal thinkin' by myself 
You catch the treatments hiatus like Sam on the shelf 
Move out your zip code with you-Haul, watch you fall 
Obtain five boxes callin' Mayflower, every hour 
You scratch your brain askin' neighbors what, now you wonder 

While you search lookin' deep in your Rolodex, I flex, I tell the truth 
When I'm serious you think I'm mysterious, drop rap in minutes 
Become your problem like Dennis the Menace 
Hold up your meetings papi, let's ? to the paparazzi 
Unseen heard of your magazine got the nerve of a two-year old crayon writing 
Talkin' to y'all I'm decidin' 
Communication leads one step to aggravation 
I got my ears closed, back to bookin' my own shoes

Check your watch, now watch me partner 
Start to welcome back kids like Kotter 
Move your pants, while I rock a little harder 
Hoes and foes, hit em all with blows 
Watch girls work it, movin' unopposed 
Hip to flip, throw the thing to they lip 
When I dress, yes, put em all to the test 
Rock a suede vest, pink jewels on my chest 
Rappin', clappin', fingers start snappin' 
Watch how you actin, I'm rubbin' on the back 
And MC's is slack and your groups sound wack 
Where'd you turn be? Nobody burn me 
Style get complex, why you concerned be	? 
I'm your chalkboard, now you can learn me 
Round and round and big bass soundin' 
Down South Hustler, big bass poundin'

In 2003, in the double R, I lean metallic green
Professional chauffeurs over my doors
Women lust over my lyrics like basketball players
NFL teams walk up unbenouced
Excuse me! I'm talkin to Tristar Pictures right now
Keyshawn Johnson I heard you a great football star
I'm not plastic, but I'm on a conference call
Talking to Michelle Phieffer and Ben Barene
Go down stairs to the movie theaters
Me and my old lady like the persuaders
Morrie alligators, 800 combination flavors
Countin presidents, we stand with cash mil's, like the Miz

[Chorus - 2x]

[Kool Keith]
Jacuzzi bathtub, with a 24-second clock to take your panties down
If not most girls get replaced by a sub
Sent home, upscale in a limosine with a Subway sandwich and a dub
erased from the system
I move better, collared shirt made of leather
Why would you be walking around Beverley Hills wearin pleather?
With lights, camera, action
A part of my MCing is a small fraction
Strong machines coming on Greyhound from Memphis
Girls screamin at the Captain, ""I wanna be saved!""
Me and Barbara Streisand walking down the corridor, with more
(And so much to offer)

Kool Keith,"(Back in the 70's, it was all about drugs..)
Tie my arm up at night between shows
Takin soda tops off of soda pops
I used to be up all night in the living room

Smokin a lot of weed with the Four Tops
Makin collect calls back home to my pops
My little brother said, ""Keith - you need to stop!""
I knew something was wrong

When I gave away my VHS and sold a pair of my socks
The IRS callin me, gettin on my nerve, I was warned by Redd Foxx
My girl, ""Keith you seen my diamond rings in the jewelry box?""
I don't know; last night you and Chaka Khan was in here sniffin blow

I was in the room sweatin thinkin about the rent playin bingo
The landlord said the first of the month, we gotta go
Packed up my bag and met Darryl Strawberry in the mall
I told James Brown stop smokin angel dust and the pis-tal

He wanted to go up to the Olive Garden and start a restaurant brawl
""Mary J. Blige, my son don't accept them type of phone calls""
I can't come out tonight, my Bic lighter don't light
I heard you and K-Ci in the background

I'm screamin did the cops come and break up the fight?
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs.. drugs..

Freebasin eighteen pounds of coke with Marvin Gaye
Put that on the table, let's parlay
With Smokey Robinson and Bootsy, lightin aluminum foil

Watch that crack pipe boil
With Richard Pryor we burned the house down gettin higher
Don't think I'm bluffin
Meet Tommy Lee Curtis, Keith Richards, Eddie Kingwards and David Ruffin

Rick James was in the kitchen lightin the flame
And Mousey's trapped with Cuba Gooding Sr.
I don't want nobody to know my name
I kept glasses on it was a damn shame

Losin weight, fallin out in big arenas
The same guy who used to deal to me
Deals to Whitney and Bobby, meet Ike and Tina
Every Saturday mansions was packed, ""Hey Jimmy you got the smack?""

Shut up! You don't know how to act
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel
All the crack and the drugs.. drugs..
All the crack and the drugs, make me feel, the way I feel

A relapse, of your mind

The date - summer, August 25th
You was transferred from Riker's Island to Attica State Prison
Gina, Thompson
I told you you shouldn'ta went out there with those other girls

And stole a coach bag out of Macy's
Arguin with me every night, you was crazy
Callin your grandmother sayin I beat you, you think I'm mental & crazy
That Benz you pulled up you stole you didn't faze me

You had a nice body with bikers
Inmates and female C.O.'s was lookin at your body at Riker's
I took time to write you a letter
But you wanted me to put dope in your sweater

I thought you was sick, with the flu, did you get any better?
Did you write back your Auntie Trineta? Floss and don't pay
Jack say he seen you with a drug dealer that day
You would of been better off takin the subway

My girl's in jail for life, never comin home - never comin home
She got to pay the price

You got too big in New York
You needed big hustlers around everywhere you walk
A lot of Cristal, fake ballers poppin corks
Now you in a two-inch cell, eatin eggs and pork

Friday the 13th, your birthday, the worst day
I still had love for your dumb ass anyway
Bentley's and Rolls Royces
The answering machine filled up with mysterious voices

Your moms Ms. Jones called, I was in the mall, she said,
""Keith - Tina and Terry got them fake credit cards.
They got my daughter out there - I ain't seen Gina in two weeks.""
I hung up the phone

I knew you was workin with some bronze pimp in the streets
(pimp in the streets.. pimp in the streets)

[Chorus]

[Kool Keith]
I called the operator to block the calls and stop the calls
The ceiling in my apartment was leakin like Niagara Falls
Sendin you a bunch of money, clothes and munchin money
You got a lot of phone call threats from a girl named Sunny

I seen the chick from the back
Puerto Rican girl with a nice ass drivin a black Cadillac
With a guy with long sideburns, is that your mack?

Admire his immaturity

Took you away to better places
Brazil, Costa Rica you seen new faces
Covered the bills you struggled to pay - gave you life
No more kid with a scarf around his beatin you up every day
Plastic surgery breast implants the small hustler made you cry
Because he was confused, you lay while he play
Cleanin my house, you look gorgeous in lingerie
Is that the kid on the phone? Hardcore
Hawkin you in front of the building everyday
When is he gonna learn? It's over, it's my turn
You're pregnant with my kid
By the fireplace, we watch his doo-rags burn
I remodeled you, gave you the diamonds he couldn't wisely concern
Always talkin bout the cash he got
The little pesos for shows
And God knows his materialistic raps and wack flows
are like Stay Free pads, fake V.I.P. rappers get garbage disposed
Unrecouped for his flamboyance and reflection
He's leasin rentin and frontin - yeah, yeah..

On a first class flight in the Bahamas, grab your bags quickly

V.I.P. with Ben Vareen
Cancel your A&R meeting light you up like Heatwave - central heating
Eject your premature CD in the whirlpool while we're eating
Shut down all material, new tracks fall on your head like a crane
All you offered to women is sound of weak drums
Fill they hearts with pain
I'm in your dungaree jacket like a bleach stain
Girls cry on my arm, he was cheap and silly don't complain
He's a nerd with a hardcore twist, playin with racing cars

Shattered your career

Witcha boring producers
Your videos are boring, same girls singin
Everybody tryin to be George Clinto and Jimi Hendrix wannabes

I'm beyong that average cha cha, that trendy Southside music
People don't hate, just motivate
You spent twenty years rappin about diamonds and Dom P
Moet and bubbly, while you front your wife and girlfriend hug me

Studio gangsters lamp at Fort Lee
With transexuals tryin to hide in secret spots in New Jersey
Cats pose in leased double-are's with two-way pagers
Frontin like you like women I seen you on your Motorola

Typin the best places to meet up with Richard Simmons and Jack Lemmon
When you in Cali you hide in the Valley
Rentin the Sheraton suites
Callin young boys that look like Johnny Versace

To meet you at Miami Beach
You wear black all the time, you look wack all the time
Got the nerve to try to pose with a girl, then spit a hard rhyme
Like you run the streets with thugs

And move with brothers who do mad crime
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel

I'm a tell you how I feel
Take you out simple add a dim effect to your spotlight
You think you hot right
Surround the tables got you kissin your bodyguards, holdin Cris'

With a FUBU jacket said ""excuse you miss""
With his hair like Lil' Kim, contact lenses
Dapper Dan gear with ice on his wrist

Your hype man walk with a twist
Just like the girls, you want a man that's rich
You want a guy to say come here BIZZITCH
Yo, you like the way celebrities fondle you and touch

You want to look onstage and stare at the crotch
I know a type of guy like you that try like you
Wear lipstick and cry like you

I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
Trendy guy like you with your man watchin Hendrix

Look at the way your corny album was mixed
That feminine stuff why'all put out was marketing tricks
Clones with costumes step out of my dressin room
Duplicators break down the reel

Your DJ funny style that makes it a trio
I don't care if you got a budget and per diem
I saw you jockin Marilyn Manson in the Niko

Don't act like you don't remember me
You used to bump my shit in Mars
Now you on some trim goatee shit like El DeBarge
Fuck the Tunnel tonight and that petty shit at the Garage

Is Stretch bumpin my shit?
Do I have to pay niggaz with envelopes and a bottle of Cris'?
Fuck a Rolex, I got the same shit you got on my wrist

All that jealousy shit is mayonnaise and celery shit
why'all hated down South and West coast rappers one time
Now everybody that was frontin is now slurpin they dick
Inhalin like Menthols and Vicks

Most of why'all can't stand to see a nigga shine with jewelry and kicks
Bad bitches and chicks, stop hatin each other

I ain't think even cool Herc came out with some ol' bullshit like that
When all the DJ's, back in the days, them niggaz stuck to-fuckin-gether

You see, Theodore, didn't mind, Mean Gene, on his set
Now these new motherfuckers, are like, on some new futuristic shit

Let him know how you got your hair done 
And you're movin like you're pregnant this month 
With your +Belly+ stickin out like movie and soundtrack 

You dress up with diamonds just to eat 
Don't even finish your plate complete 
When the bill come, you try to act like you can't see the receipt 
Walkin up the block with Vivica Fox type girlfriends 
Jockin a seventy-year old man, in a mansion 
With a seventy-five Rolls Royce, that look like Alfred Hitchcock 
Maybe he can afford your liposuction stretch marks and tax deduction 
The second verse is still introduction 
So you actin like a sad puppy 
Lookin at me through the fish tanks like a guppy 
(Why you have to look at me so stupid like that?) 

Maxin in the shade, I know your type 
Maxin in the shade, I know your type 
Maxin in the shade, I know your type 

First of all I bought the food you didn't even say thank you 
Now put on your bibs and chew your ribs 
You got grease on your hand and your favorite skirt 
I'ma call your mom after you get off work so your head hurt 
You wasn't invited to the concert that's V.I.P. backstage 
Who's this? What you doin here? 
I'm ashamed of you, I'm bein straight 
I hate you, I'm not gonna face you 
I'ma take you to White Castle asshole 
I don't wear platinum, I wear gold 
My maturity ability is laughin at you like comedy 
You need to sit down, pull out a Swanson TV dinner 
Peanut butter and jelly'll fill up your belly 
Bread in the cabinet start grabbin it 
Kool-Aid and lemonade get comfortable under the shade 
And let the barbershop, give your bob wig a tight fade 

Maxin in the shade, I know your type 
Maxin in the shade, I know your type 
Maxin in the shade, I know your type

All seven of your big-head kids are ugly",Maxin in the Shade

Your man is a tourin nigga, six-foot-eight floss nigga

who carries champagne in the club with Coogi sweaters
Borin nigga, no game havin
Less rap skill, N.B.A. nigga with a studio you ill
Don't you know my game terrorize

Six-foot-three guards on the microphone, my lyrics kill
Why don't you awkward niggaz stop rhymin and take a birth control pill
Jackson got you gassed, ask Phil
I'm not impressed with your full court press

Girls with Tyra Banks weaves, and Lisa Raye's complexion
can step up to the foul line for an AIDS test
My jewelry like big trucks
I don't care if you flash your Milwaukee Bucks

Even bodyguards couldn't protect you ducks
I care less if you a Trailblazer
My cris-cross on girls is sharp, why'all get cut off with a razor
Even if you have braids like Latrell

I got more numbers in my system than Pacific Bell
Pass the basketball around and go tell
Smoother than Rick Fox puttin on his hair gel
Groupies don't have to know me, just swallow my sperm when you blow me

Keith look in the club for your celebrity jump shooters
Tall lean men who can't read books to they kids need tutors
You cats got the nerve to try to stop my tomahawk dunks
by e-mailing, golddiggers on computers

Leap over why'all with color and fashion
Lame assholes in black pinstripe suits, keep steppin and passin
Beyond the youse-a-baby, you broke finished payin for them car notes

I take 'em blind crippled and crazy, ugly or pretty
I beat it up, make the pussy meow like a kitty

So slow your roll, slide upside down on the pole
Bounce that ass, bounce that ass, let your knees touch your elbows
In Detroit, Michigan cruisin spaceships of Daddyville
Just got back from Bootyville, spending big face bills

On some exotic body hottie erotic
Vision blurry from the narcotics, keep pushin CRAZY products
Parlay, parlay, twenty-fo' seven all day
Spendin like Michael Jackson the ""Off the Wall"" way

Make your booty clap, chickenheads flap chicken wings
Padussy juice on my diamond rings, from the fast finger-ing
And the smell's linger-ing

Rack up control and move when the butts stack up

It's all RODEO, for a cup, like Romeo
Move in your area, girl what? We ain't scared of ya
Two drinks minimum - don't worry, we maximum

When assed up to the pole, now we taxin 'em
Detroit Los Angeles Miami can you handle this?
My shit gets frisked while you stare and sweat, weave twist

I'm like a freak from Hunts Point  the bronze and the gold 
Wear my drawers in tight mode  naked with no coat 
Walkin' around  I see you'se about to lose her 
That honey with white boots  and hair like Medusa 

Brown-skin fine, I drink her body like wine 
And throw the wax on it, and watch two cheeks shine 
I drunk a forty, I'm up in here feelin' naughty 
I like the go-go girl, go 'head work it shorty 

I got no time to trick, on the average girl 
I'm in paradise, caught up, in the booty world 
And for you regular honies, tryin' to play fly 
I ain't no Chemical no Bank in your human eye 

I like my spot, everybody's butt naked 
Pump with G-strings, watchin' hot momma shake it 
I got my beer, viewin' from the back rear 
Yo brother man, pass it right over here 

I got to ease off the stress, like a eight to five 
Keepin' it real vexed, them panties want to get live 
Change the pace up, yo Jimmy turn the bass up

Left the brother to catch wreck, then tell the man goodbye

With seven rubbers on me, don't try to discontinue 

We got's to bump and grind, crank up the R. Kelly 
Delicious kickin', no leather like I'm Fonzarelli 
I order two drinks to think, while you show me pink 
Summer Eve breeze and WOO when it don't stink 

I'm in the mix, like Funky-master Flex 
I'm shootin' gizm, then after you can pick up next 
I watch you shake it, like palm trees in California 
Now you a lady, mature and I'm rubbin' on ya 

I got my Phantom mask, I'm on the dolo 
I slipped in my Tipton, bonin' sweetie look like Yo-Yo 
She had a good time, knees bent in the chair 
She said, ""Get wild - I like it when you pull my hair"" 

I gave her cream, and rubbed it on her black boots 
I see a packed house in different color body suits 
I'm in the front row, chillin' on the down low 
Checkin' her dogstyle, she's ?? 

I'm from the back kid, smooth with tons of grease 
Denver and Texas, and Cali on back to East 
She hittin' switches, and watch she make it low ride 
Zoot, zoot, zzzzzzzt

It's three o'clock, the morning shift's about to come 
Watchin' Goldie lap dance, that grey hiney ain't no slum 
I gets my workout, my slickest hand from every angle 
She's on the job right, cutie pie sippin' Tango 

I gotta peel for real, a hundred dollar bill 
I'm comin' straight up, and not for a breakfast meal 
This ain't no Burger King, this ain't no White Castle 
Not like some ugly girls in Bentley's tryin' to give a hassle 

I like the slot machine, bustin' nuts mean 
Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline 
I'm pullin' nylon, yo dead up G, to the side 
Feelin' soft flesh, I'm hard, I'm a let her ride 

Jump up and down, get live like House of Pain 
Leavin' em so wet, the silk with a tan stain 
I reach a climax, she's happy with her orgasms 
Go on girl!

With priests I'm from the Church of the Operating Room 
With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust 
I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients 
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse 
Holding up office lights standing at huge heights 
Back and forth left wing swing to North 
East and South with blood pouring down your mouth 
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope 
Listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP 
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap 
Look at the land... Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow 
Would you care to listen to me more? Thank you 
Holding bags on down right from the hospital 
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf 
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidote 
Two telescopes that magnify the size of a roach 
Three computers to cup of coffee planted with my hand and 
Astroplanets detached turn on rear foggers 
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on 
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves 
I see the mascot of Evil he's not Knievel 
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it 
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see... Blue Flowers!

I ain't doin' that type of shit (I ain't doin' that shit)
You motherfuckers think I'm crazy right? (yeah you crazy)
I know, but I am..

I have to show niggas, word g, I have to blow niggas
Tech 9's, carbines, pointin' in your fuckin' faces
Thirty-eight magnum butcher knife man, watch me stab em
Q his kid left there, with ambulances, by the wheelchair

Dangerous action, I'm the movie, I'm the main attraction
Fuck up your front lawn with m&m's, jiffy popcorn
Piss in your mailbox, throw shitty pampers every two blocks
Cut up your great dane, with charcoal out, leavin' great flame

You fuckin' bastard, don't fuck with me, you gettin' blasted
Niggas get fucked up, you black niggas are actin' white
Your Rolex gone, my project's on your airplane flights
First time you check out, baggage claim will throw your neck out

Cut off your bodyguards, fast start with razor scars
Come grab the sub machines, Joe step to seminars
Niggas with diamonds, armed crack heads, clock y'all rhymin
Take your girl's necklace, stare at the cops, lookin' reckless

Ass on the corner, think you safe workin' at warner brothers?
Polygram building heard some shots, they want me to chill then
Security ran, Russell Simmons saw me in a black van
I ran the tight intersection, and caught a big erection

Spinnin' on 3rd, lexington, through the fuckin' red
I'm in manhattan, naked wigs, on my fuckin' head

You open mic stands, you catch one, with sperm in your hand

I leave you thinkin' in your hotels, with pussy stinkin'
Massengil thrills flow through new york, to Hollywood hills
Your male flow, I'm wipin' ass cracks like mop-n-glo
Mc's get inserts, thrash style selectin' bad words

Move with your silk suits, I stomp your mics with combat boots
Make up your rap that's feeble, small you think it's major
I pull your rectum out, erase your girl, off my pager
International feedback, I make you twist your knee back

I got your crew on camcorders, tryin' to rhyme in teaback's
Garter belts on dj's, sportin' tryin' to spin on felts
I see that rugged kid comin' through, gimme that screwface

Move on your projects, new shit, that's how I do shit
Word up g, y'all niggas sound puss, lick my pee-pee veteran nasty
Don't even try to fuckin' ask me, fax you my phone number
I beat you down with steel cans and wood lumber

Open your face up, dress you with makeup
Have your bitch-made, makin' cool-aid with your ass out
In a glass house, where convicts wear big dicks
Strong niggas, got your assholes in the mix

Name of this track is called ""I Don't Want the Motherfuckin Chorus""
Whatever all the arrangements are we gon' go through
Fuck all the laws..

What the fuck was in your mind when you rapped on that track?
Who possessed you to do that? Who programmed - that shit sound wack
Unplug your mic
You motherfuckers rap under a bunch of fuckin hype
Programmed by the company, makin somethin cheap
Vocals sound like a nigga with no dough and a promo;
makin asses out of yourselves, tryin to rap solo
Suck my dick when you see me; avoid because you want to be me
why'all niggaz write like slouches puffin blunts on studio couches
What's up you fuckin amateur?
Your engineer'll cue in your bullshit cadence
That shit sounds simple; look at this nigga rhymin to hisself
Wack as fuck, smell like shit for one buck
Big crews don't want it -- why'all get it worse
Which one of why'all motherfuckers is waitin for the mic first?
I hope your bitch is in the audience
Your wife too, that's your fanbase -- plus your DJ's in the place
I'm about to boo you, let it be fair; when you come off-stage
ninety percent of the people that came on your guest list
ain't gon' be there
A big dissapointment when I rub your asshole with a verbal ointment
Rappers actin hard, nervous in the dressin room
with a security guard
Groupies standin round with they fuckin face frowned
Lookin like fuckin Homey the Clown
Put that Spring Water down man, you ain't sweatin
You motherfuckers did a ten minute weak show and you jettin;
your fans are mad - your performance was garbage bag
Look at these videotapes
Walkin back and forth grabbin your nuts like the Planet of the Apes
Supervise it, criticize it, why'all don't realize it
where the real guys at
Who's administrating your budget when you takin 
that high picture for Right On with your ballroom light on
You know the night is kind of special like Lowenbrau
when I escort you to your car, you breakout bastards
Leave the premises and reminisce on your rookie season after you first started
You try to work hard and you never paid no dues like Cold Crush and Afrika Bambaata
You wack nigga, tryin to act large in the video in Nevada
You fuckin pink maggot; I'll take your mic, you can't have it
You niggaz be runnin around with ears open like fuckin bunny rabbits

That's right, Dr. Dooom
All you motherfuckers around the world sittin in studios with your boys
Hypin your shit up
Motherfuckers don't want to tell you that your shit is wack
because they all yes men
Sittin around, carryin your roadie cases
Bein your fuckin cheerleaders
I'ma tell you straight, look in the fuckin mirror, you wack
That shit don't sound right, your mixdown ain't right
Your vocals are too low.. your fuckin cadence is off

Kool Keith,"""Yeah  cool Keith should keep it real 
He should rap about space and Mars""

[Kool Keith] 
Yo  I'm tired of looking at everybody. Same boots  skully hats in 
90 degree weather  looking to get into clubs for free. I'm not 
smoking blunts  or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt. 

I left New York  the city itself was stress depression 
High boots and urban beats  that wasn't my direction 
Producers filtering join in with R&B 
A million rappers, some clones trying to sound like me 
Biting my space styles, biting my horror-core 
All I saw was cool Keiths on my thaw 
Record companies had G'd-off all my royalties 
Watching vinyl spin, local groups' wack MC's 
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap 
Karl Kani jeans, fat stomachs in the limousines 
Mixtapes by wack DJ's adds doo doo play 
I'm on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway 
Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion 
On videos out of town, peoples buy confusion 
Rolling high with cash pulled over down my eye 
Since I've been out, y'all can't see 

[Chorus]
Is the world made of plastic? 
Is the city buried in dreams? (Yeah) 
Is the world made of plastic? 
Cause that's the way is seems

Watching TV so bored, while imbiciles hold the mic cord 
Graffiti playgrounds are played out, yo how'd that sound? 
Army fatigues are weak, is for the minor leagues 
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented Benz 
Crews on stage, acting hard with a thousand friends 
I saw the place turn plastic, crackers looping beats 
People with no deals, walkmen rappin on the streets 
I turned my back, 90% of the city sounded wack 
Payola scams switched DJ's like a rubber band 
Everybody clear with beats trying to be Premier 
Clearing samples, your SP-12 fake examples 
My money grows with green from my own label 
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label 
Your tri-state ways are shut down by barricades 
In fact I packed my bags, and listened to E-40 
Mac Mall, see-Bo, and other rappers you don't know 
You're narrow-minded and styles of mind you won't find it 
My sound proceeds with moog and undertone bass 
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face 
I come back real, solid rock razor steel 
Tap your program, show the world I'm the man 
You copy Poppa Large, the industry is large 

[Chorus: x2]

As I do see sorta rugged wack beer commercials 
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles 
From Manhattan I heat up, yo light up Times Square 
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare 
No promotional shows, girls wear corn rows 
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes 
I walk with straw hats, fake glasses in the projects 
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage 
Playing my numbers, waiting for the Five to come 
Spaghetti out the window, people acting dumb 
Fire hazards wake the neighbors, your family's nosy 
I come and go as I please on blockhead MC's 
You bought new sneakers, no car, scrambling on the corner 
I'm not the star you are, the city's fallen far 
By mechanism, you're on my tip 
Stay off my penis, you've duplicated me for years 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are the one

I used to check out, use the mad route 
Stare at these ugly bitches, sit at the table with frowns with their
Stomachs out
Cellulite for weeks, rules in these NewYork streets
With mad Babies, big heads movin' in the stroller
You gettin' older while that dress hangs off your shoulder
You stupid bitch
He's sick, the kids got the shits
You walkin' wack with those problems in your ass crack
You chose this nigga, he's a zero girl, doin' nothin'
You was buggin' because the bum had curly hair
You got psyched, the baby came out with some nappy hair
You was a fine freak, thoroughbred dumb with no head
I seen you screamin' with your panties up in B.B.Q's
Your friends are fat with guts, breakin' all the rules
You choose to lose, no cheers, recievin' booes
Rent is due with some old crab nigga fuckin' you
It's true, it's summertime, what you gonna do?
Every winter you got this gay man screwin' you
This bitch is a problem, no money, fuckin' dummy
She's from the slum actin' fly eatin' bread crums
Shoplifted programs out on the boulevard
Stretch marks leak out your tight dress, your legs are scarred

It's like a disease the way niggas be snatchin' your fees
Executives, even accountants playin' artists like chips
The last time you were legit I was suckin' on nips
Up in my shit like a Dog checkin' the sex
Maybe to get in the Lex
Hey, they forget, all the doors slammin' 
They crammin', eye jammin' 
Wait, ""My shows slammin'""
Cash up your nose Hammond
Landin' deals ain't shit if your label ain't shit
Nitwits spit for sips while I flip scripts legit 
Commit to whippin' ass on the mic, it's like a fuckin' runway
These niggas is like bitches fleein' from gunplay
One day when lyrical finesse is stressed instead of dress I'll compress
Compression and hate, blow out the best
But it's cool, fools like you makin' crews that's blue stay true
One-Thousand lyrical orators, pay dues
So snooze and get dissed
Bust in the head with Cris', fake ice on your wrist
I'm nice and you on my dick like piss
You wish you was half the lyricist that I persist to be

Don't front now, them breasts are ready, I'ma milk the cow 
With rockets that blow, paralyze your anal sockets 
My fantasy is hidin used condoms in your pockets 
while you chill, here's a towel, plus your Massengil

You become confused and so enthused
Cause the rhymes I use can make you lose
Total control, and if I choose
To call you the paperboy you'll spread the news
Like Paul Revere: ""A real rapper is here!""
Yeah, ""Moe Dee is coming, Moe Dee is coming""
And teeth will chatter, plagiarism scatter
Nothing is the matter, you're just looking at a
Real rap trooper with a power so super
After battlin me, I guarantee you won't recouper-
ate cause I am great, I can make you hate
To ever look in the mirror and affiliate
Yourself with anything but an average person
Lovin my success but envious and cursin
You want my autograph, don't act like a sucker
Just gimme a pound cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

I put a hurtin on rappers, egos are crushed
Pride is swallowed, asses are bust
Hearts are taken, souls cremated
Lips are sealed and they hate it
Overrated rappers made it
On a wing and a prayer with old beats updated
But I'm not like you bitin barbarics
Rappers with the fresh beats and weak lyrics
I'm cyanide, deadly and lethal
I never run out, I got an automatic refill
I never get cold, I only get lukewarm
When I want to get hot, I have a real brainstorm
Ideas start flowin, my talents start showin
And if the music stops, Moe Dee keeps goin
I'm bigger than life and deeper than death
The world of rap is like a kitchen and I am the chef
Boy, are these MC's really startin to irk me
Make it to the top, then try to jerk me
Ask em who's the best, their shoulders start shruggin
Like they don't know, they must be buggin
But I like the controversy, it makes me blood-thirsty
And one day I'll make them all beg for mercy
So remember that if you want to act like a sucker
Don't ever make me mad cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

I'm the kinda rapper that a dummy won't dig
My IQ's too high, my words are too big
My voice too clear and my rhymes are ample
Some things I won't do, and here's an example
I won't make a 'La-Di-Da-Di', an 'Oh Veronica'
A 'Dear Ivette' or a La-'Latoya'
I'm not tryin to dis the rappers that made these cuts
As a matter of fact I like them, but
Records like that are for the average MC
Not for the highly rated Moe Dee
I have a formula, I'm like a scientist
And I must put words together like this
My voice is a ?????, coming out an orophus
Expressing ?????, verbally or if it's
Mental ??asymetrics?? that makes me so electric
By spontaneous combustion an explosion is expected
A walking time bomb that can't be disconnected
I'm a rhymer with a timer, I'm a english dialectic
My ideas are impeccable, rhymes are paragon
My soliloquy will affect ya like Farrakhan
Love me or hate me, agree or debate me
Watchin suckers gather round, bow down ????? be-
Cause what I do orally I something so morally
Stimulating, emmulating heat that's corally
My mind is both flexible and resillient
Pugnacious, tenacious ??????, I'm brilliant
Through rigorous training, it's self-explaining
Why I'm standing on the top and that's where I'm remaining
My brain rocks like Mr. Spock's
And any other MC's are knocked out the box
So you know where to kiss, so line up and pucker
Sucker MC's, I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad (mutha-)

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

Now I was never solo, I was always in a group
So now you new jacks are a little too souped
So if you think you could take mine
Then come on and make my
Day, you idiot, you knew from the giddy-up
You didn't have a chance
But if you want drop the pants
I spank that ass so fast that the next time you glance
Everyone will be laughin and you'll be the stock
Cause that's what's good about havin you MC's on the jock
I could go on and on and on and on for days
But everytime I speak I get unwanted protegees
If you've been lucky so far, don't press your luck
Cause you don't really want none cause I'm a bad, bad, bad (mutha-)

Kool Moe Dee,"Do you know what time it is?

Girlies are partying, touching my body and
Talking to me like I'm a kindergartian
Today she's on mine, tomorrow she's on his
But don't worry about me, because I know what time it is
Time to get mine while you try to get yours
I'll get mine pause in those silky drawers
Take you to the cleaners and I got a trick
Cause all you're ever going to get is a piece of my dee-dee-duh
Didn't you know that my girlie, my toe
It's easy to come, but harder to go
Hope you got a good heart and you're a good sport
Cause I'm a treat you like beaver on a basketball court
I'm gonna run you around, take you up and down
Take you out and leave you in the lost and found
So if you want to be down, miss listen to this
Before you deal with me, you'd better know what time it is

	Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)

Some girlies are pretty, some girlies are fine
But most girlie girlies like to play with your mind
They like sporting new gold and riding in cars
And most of them, they don't care who you are
They're materialistic and unrealistic
And to most of them you're nothing but another statistic
Whoever's got the money, they're all on his
y'all can save it for David, cause I know what time it is

	Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)
	Check the clock!

Put your Gucci watch on and synchronize the time, and let's rock

Girls for me come a dime a dozen
And that's why I never never was a
Situation where I could get jerked
Like a mechanic, all I do is bodywork
Want my money?  You must be a fool
Cause like Billy Idol said, I'm gigalo cool
Moe Dee, that's me, introduce yourself, miss
But don't try to be slick, cause I know what time it is
Time to make sure that the girlies stay poised
String 'em out so they will always want more
Don't come around here and try to get richer
Don't ask me for no money, cause baby baby baby
Bet you don't know me from a can of paint
And I bet you think I'm fronting but I tell you I ain't
And I bet you think you know, but I'll tell you like this:
I'll be you don't know (Know what?) What time it is

	Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 4x)

It's time to get money, time to get paid
It's time to have fun, it's time to get laid
Like to front like I'm poor, I don't drive, instead
I be chilling in a Jetta with my man that be red
Riding all around the city and half the world
And after talking from girl to girl
All you ladies seem to sing the same old song
Makes it hard for me when a real girl comes along
Now I'm a veteran, a girl all-pro
And as many as I've had, I still don't know
So I made a little system so I can tell
Doesn't always work, but what the hell?
Don't ask me for nothing, and don't give me nothing
And keep it like that for about a whole month and
Half and I'll laugh and maybe one day miss
Maybe you can be down, maybe you can be down
Maybe you should be down cause you know what time it is

	Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)

Well, listen up, homeboys, I got somethin to say
About a homeboy from back in the day
His name was Richard, some called him Rick
But if you knew him like me, you'd call him Dick
When we were growin up, we stuck with each other
Like white on rice, he was kinda like a brother
We had a lotta fun when we were kids
We always overlooked the dumb things he did
But the fun was over when we got to high school
Cause it was time for gettin girlies, so we had to be cool
We had a lotta girlies, and our friends were impressed
One thing went wrong, Rick got obsessed
We wouldn't go to class, always think about ass
Not if he was gonna pass, if he would just last
Girls was all he was thinkin about
If the school was all boys, he'da been dropped out
When he did drop out, he felt no shame
And if you ask me, he had the right name
Cause he hated to go, but he loved to come
That's why I call him Dick, cause Dick is Dumb

He wouldn't go to school, but he had to survive
So he went out and got him a 9 to 5
Although he was lazy, he had to work
Cause he had a lot of girls, he needed money, the jerk
As fast as he made it, his money was spent
When it came to girls, he didn't care where he went
He'd hound em like a dog, so we used to say ""fetch!""
And it was no tellin what he would catch
He was in the doctor's office almost every week
He became so popular, everybody'd speak
When he walked in they'd say (Hi Rick)
And when he passed by, they'd say (Dumb Dick)
Really hard-headed, cause he said he had juice
But it was cause of his hard head, that he was so loose
He was in love with another girl every day
And when we asked him why, he'd only say
(I'm the kinda guy who likes to have fun
I need a lotta girls, can't have just one)
I can understand that, but this is kind of insane
Sometimes I wonder if his brain
Was his...

He lost his girl when he lost his job
So to keep himself from livin like a no-good slob
He hustled on the streets, cause he had no choice
And every day you'd hear his voice
Sayin ""Jumbos! I got it good""
But he never made the money that a hustler could
Cause when he was standin out on the corner
If a girl walked by, he was right up on her
He was so hot, his heat couldn't be measured
To him his business was his pleasure
A one-track mind, and as a matter of fact
He changed his name to Daddy Mack
The people on the streets he was workin for
Cut him off, now he's just plain old poor
And all his girls left, because they never cared
The were leeches for a dollar, and they got their share
Homeboy disappeared like a magic trick
And everybody want to know what happened to Dick
Well, he's still around, but now he's a bum
Chasin bag ladies, he's the same old Dumb

Kool Moe Dee,"What are you crazy, you know who I am
(Moe Dee!) yes, I'm the man
I am the flyest, cleanest, baddest, meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
I'll take you where I want to go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if there's someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross, they'll say, 'don't you know?
Really, really, really don't you know?'
Cause I'm a real rap warrior, Elite Astoria
I'll take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And I'll prove that they're all ducks
Cause I don't care nothin 'bout your money and gold
Don't want to hear about how many recrods you sold
Cause none of that don't mean nothin to me
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm cool Moe Dee

What are you senile, have you lost your mind?
I'm the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rapper's hall of fame, bein that it's all a game
I might not be down, because some rappers got a name
From screamin and yellin with hot records sellin
But your rhymes are smellin, that's why I'm tellin
You, when I go, homeboy, I'm gone
Cause I'm better but don't get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant, my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And we're all enemies on the court
But when the game is over I'll shake your hand
Give ya a pound, cause you're still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy, it's a new game plan
Cause I gotta disrespect ya, try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown cause I'm an intellect, ya
Bird brain rappers I call hip-happers
Not hip-hoppers, cause y'all just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins, soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But I'm perfect, I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but no Ali
I'm cool Moe Dee

Don't piss me, I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off? Don't diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers, beam em up, take their minds and broaden it
Set em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by mega-millions, you witness a burst
Of a new society, rappers with variety
So much prestige, flair and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
It's hard to believe but think about it, it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
There's no race no contest, I'll never have to jostle
They're small time, to them I am collossal
I'm a gladiator with the image of a god
I'm powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm, recite em as poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement ????
The Ice Man cometh, cool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god, apex of the hip-hop cult
I'm the leader rhyme breeder, yes, I am the ult-
imate idolized figure, there's not a name bigger
Than cool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and that's cause I
Really feel that I'm the best, so I personify
Rap to the fullest, I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I don't stop rockin under no condition
I rock non-stop but don't ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion, some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion?
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if it's your brain, the answer's of course cause I'm a
Auto-hypnotic, reverse-pschotic
That'll make you feel, if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali

1986 - return of the horror flicks
More deadly than _The Omen_, a killer and a showman
Like the devil in _The Excorcist_
But this flick can cause a heart attack
Cause it's more than action-packed
It's alive and killin and the star is a villain
And his name is Monster Crack
The crack monster

He talks to ya like he's alive
And when he talks like bees to a hive
The people come runnin, the older and the young'in
The place he lives in is the house they hung in
He wants your money, only your money
He'll make you feel good for a real fast twenty
The bill is passed and the dollars go fast
The feeling is high but the high don't last
Long enough for you to even read a paper
But you still thirst and hunger for the vapor
Although he is an animate, he'll make you feel
That he can breathe, think, talk and bleed for real
You should stay away cause all he's about
Is just makin you broke and stringin you out
It only takes one kiss and a deep, deep breath
Then you're hooked for life cause it's the kiss of death

Like savoir-faire he's everywhere
He'll hook an innocent baby cause he don't care
He loves to eat, girls and boys, and he's nothin but poison
The biggest ????? of Michael Jackson he's makin noise in
The streets he's notorious, to pushers he's glorious
To girls he's a pimp cause he turns em to the whoriest
Materialistic nymphomaniacs
That'll do anything for Monster Crack
Give away her body, steal from her brother
Fight her father or sell her mother
Cause when you're possessed by Crack, God bless
Your soul, cause he'll take the rest

The power of the mind should not be wasted
But the agony of defeat is always tasted
By those who chose to willingly oppose
??????? instead they follow their nose
And the more you get, the more you want
You're killin your brain out, so later on it'll haunt
You you become insatiable, you can't get enough
When your money gets low, things really get rough
It's your only objective, you lose all perspective
On life, you're obsessed, possessed and defective
Losin weight and disappearin but still perseverin
Your body tells you no, but all you're hearin
Is the crack talk

In South Africa many a brother died
Tryin to fight back against apartheid
Bombs are flying, people are dying
Terrorists terrorizing and the whole world's trying
To prevent another war, but I got a surprise
There's already - one right before your eyes
And we're nowhere near, the end this is only the beginning
Until this point the Crack has been winning
Weakening hearts, corrupting minds
A stone cold killer, very easy to find
And once he's caught by the law, he can't go to jail
Cause he's nothin but a little piece of matter for sale
Usin people like pawns in the game of chess
And he is the king, more powerful than the rest

Like the core of an apple, the priest of the chapel
With the mic in my hand I'm like a surgeon with a scalpel
Ready to operate the rhymes that I create
Sounds like music to your ears cause I can combinate
Bass and treble to create a level
Of highs and lows of sounds that goes
With syncopated concrete-created
Beats that meet the standard of a street credit
Gotta critique a rhyme if it's weak
You won't want to speak if your rhymes not peak

Timber as they tower, because I devour

A little bit later, cause I'm a graduator
From a rhymin' alma mater, but some say alma mata
Like you say patata, I say potato
Tomato, tomata, my data's up to data
Cause somethin' is the matter with those of you say dada
Could mean opposite of mama, like the kids at Wonderama

Some will do anything for a bill
Cause they think they'll get respect

And up the river's where you'll go

	Whatcha mean I don't get no respect?
	You crazy?
        You got to respect me

And every day's like a title bout
When the next man wants you taken out
I'd like to know what you're thinkin about
It sure ain't dyin without a doubt
But you better wake up before it's too late
Or they'll be doing your make-up down at the coroner's place
And you will have lived just to die
And you'll die with no respect

Kool Moe Dee,"I'm The Don
Armed and dangerous
With a mic I like
Ordain I just 
Make a wish
It becomes a command
The rhyme family
Is my fans
My territory spans
From New York to Hollywood the whole country's
My neighborhood
I extort my fans support
With rhymes that taught
Lessons and caught
The ears of listners
They enlist in the 
Hip hop mob on the job
Stop dissin' us
No drugs at all
We don't steal or rob
We just get paid 
In the Moe Dee mob
I demand fans family loyalty
Tour support and record royalties
Whenever a band tries to take my fans
I put out a hit understand
I'm The Don
I'm The Don
Started out in parks
As a hit man killin'
With the rhymes that sparks a mic
Sparks of light
Turns dark to light
Freeze emcees
And rock the mic
Hit the deck
You know what this is
Don't nobody move
And I mean biz
One dumb hero
Tried to step
I pulled out my mic
I rhymed him to death
Other emcees wouldn't
Put me on
So I took over
Now they're gone
I made the connections
Got paid protection
Fees from emcees
No late collections
I take no shorts
Up front on the double
You ain't got it
You got trouble
I'll put out my mic
And a rhymr to bust
Hum
Another one bites the dust
I'm The Don
With the ladies 
I ain't just a Don
In fact I'm more
Like a Don Juan
Pull ladies
In bunches
Break my heart
I roll with the punches
Write 'em off like a tax
No respect
You ain't down
Next
Cause I'm like
A hard-core Casanova
Cross me once
Girlfriend you're over
Outta here quick as
A jet no sweat
Ain't no limit
To the girls I get
No time for games
Make no mistakes
Dis me you're done
That's the brakes
One conversation
Gets my point across
You don't like me
It's your loss
Spread the news
I get rave reviews
I'll make you
An offer you can't refuse
I'm The Don
The Don
Takes control of the action
Without question
And who's askin'
A takeover
Now in effect
A world tour
To make my connect
The R&B radio
Family supports me
We'll put a hit out
On Top 40
Video families
B.E.T.
We'll put a hit on 
MTV
Store reports
And the Billboard charts
Work hand in hand
With the local jocks
As hit men for hire
Personal hit men
Makin' the hits
From the very first shipment
Red and Chuck
And the fans that love me
Mr. Magic and my man
Buggsy
The hottest D.J.'s in every town is down
I'm The Don
A sucker emcee
In a second I'll dis
With a flick of the wrist
He'll kiss my fist
Tip his hat
And bend and bow
Ump
How ya like me now
The O.K. Coral
And the Wild Wild West
Is recreated when 
Put to the test
Sparks will fly
Like the 4th of July
My name in flames
Will light up the sky
Other rappers go down
Tryin' to confront me
You know where to find me
Whenever you want me
But think real hard
Before you step
Remember
I'm a vet
Been runnin' the yard
Ever since grade school
Never played cool
But always stayed cool
Before you think about steppin'
I already saw ya
Step off boy 
I got somethin' for ya
I'm The Don",The Don
Kool Moe Dee,"Yo 
I had to go for mine
From the bottom to the top is a hard climb
But hard rhymes beat hard times
Gimme a spotlight and I'll shine
Brither than the brightest star
No matter who you are
You're outdone
I won
And for the coup de grace
Competition turns into fans
Like a politician
My competition spans
From country to country
It's never too far cause I'll take 'em all
From the Shah to the Czar
The Fu Man Chu
The Prime Minister too
The King and the Queen
My rhymes are so mean I'll do
A number on the country
Like never before
Is it a contest
Or the threat of world war
Choose your weapon no half-steppin'
And let's go
But if ya steppin' watch ya step
And step slow
Take your time change your mind
Cause steppin' to my rhyme is like
steppin' on a land mine
Blowing you to kingdom come
This ain't Vietnam
A brother thinks he's ready for war brings him on
A perilous journey
You catch a hernia
Trying to burn me
Cause like an attorney I'll
Cross-examine
Your rhymes of my design
And I'm styill standing
Tall

Meanwhile laughin' all the way to the bank

Suckers
Tried to put me down
Siad rap was crap
And wouldn't be around
Any longer than two years 
But eight years later
I'm still here
Fully paid
Because the rhymes I made
Made dollars and cents 
I wasn't dense
I stayed
Away from drugs
I never touched a pipe
When I want to get high
I smoke the mic
I never did white lines
I only write lines
And I ain't sniffin' nothing but 
The vapors from hype rhymes
As I start to float
On the rhymes I wrote
Ascending to a level with the gods and I tote
Loads and mounds of people
As they reach new heights
A half-a-mile from heaven is the party site
And I'm the attraction
The ods will be packed in
Coming out of their pockets for me to rock it
And acting
Like they've never ever ever been entertained
They try to act godly but they can't maintain
Aphrodite would freak
As her knees get weak
And Venus would peak
Off every word I speak
Zeus would get loose
Fully induced
I'll make Apollo's ryhmes sound like
Mother Goose
By night's end
Mercury is so hyped
He'd spread the word
That there's a god on the mic
Captivating all the other gods
By the masses
Described as a dark-skinned brother in glasses
But unlike the other gods
I ain't a myth

I suggest you take the fifth

Knowledge
Is the source of my success
History is the course
And life's the test
For those who don't know
History's repetitive
Lack of knowledge
Serves as a sedative
Makes you relax and max
The lack of facts
Holds you back
The odds are stacked
Against a weak mind
Makes a meek mind
But mine ain't weak
I got a piece and I'ma speak mine
Telling you the truth
I raise the roof
With rhymes so hard
I'm bulletproof
One slip of the lip
Could sink your ship
You want to get hip
Let's take a trip
All aboard
This is the last call
I ain't a mandate cause
I'll only ask y'all
Once and only once
To purchase a ticket
Get on the rap train
Watch me kick it
From state to state
And every little hick town
They'll all be down
With the new hip sound
Treating me like more
Than just a star of the sport
But more like the judge in a court
y'all rise
And raise your hands in the air
Pump your fists
And solemnly swear
To rock the truth
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth
Not only the youth
Cause the young and the old
Are all alike
It makes no difference

Driving down the highway 
Girlies behind me
Jockin' blindly
No need to remind me

Stop screamin' and yellin' and pointin' I'm low key
No I ain't got no time for a picture
But slide your number 
And I'll get wit ya
You want to ride 
Ya shouldn't of said that 
You played yourself
And I know where your head's at
Drive my car don't make me laugh
You better settle for an autograph
Or a hug and a kiss on the cheek maybe
But I ain't trying to make no baby
Forget all the silly rumors you heard
Here's the deal so spread the word
No, 
I ain't got no girlfriend
No,
I ain't buy no car
No,
I ain't got no babies
A lot of ladies
Naw, they want money
And I can see'em a mile away
And when they push up
I just smile and say
Back up off me
Smell the coffee
You're screamin' and plottin'
And I'm killing you softly
Watchin' you melt from the second I kiss ya
Hear dollar signs in your careless whispers
I know the game it's old and lame
You're holdin' a flame for my name and my fame
Livin' like Givens schemin' on Tyson
But she got lucky cause he was a nice one
But I ain't nice and I don't play that
If it ain't tax I don't pay that
You think you're in cause you turn me on
Here one minute and the next you're gone

A young brother in a Benz legit
I don't sell no drugs and take no shh
Park my ride and the ladies hit
So many ladies the cops had a hint
They took me in cause they thought I pimped
Jetted from the station back in a flash
They had nothing on me but cold cold cash
Ladies they all want to get with

So they want to get with

And ride shotgun
So people can see ya
And think I got one

Since the day I was born I was on a mission
Never played out of position or wishin or missin
I came out kissin, was no spankin the backside
Just lots of lady nurses waitin for black eyes
I - I was talkin way before I could crawl or walk
And what the ladies heard, wasn't baby talk
I'd drop a line like a bomber would drop a bomb
Highly explosive, but notice, I was cool and calm
Ready for action, at the age of 1 the fun
Was just beginning, I was winning, the ladies would come
With arms open and hopin for a kiss and a hug
I stripped down, huh, and watched the ladies bug
I stood up for a while, then I started walkin
I heard the ladies say, ""Look who's talkin""
That's right, baby, you can leave me alone
Cause if you can't please me, don't tease me, cause I'm bad to the..

As a teen I was on the scene cleaner than clean
Mean lean fighting machine with self-esteem
No dope, crack, coke, flat broke I'm not
Sell smoke, nope, nope, won't smoke the pot
Gettin high off life was more than enough
And peer pressure ain't pressure when a boy is tough
And I was tougher than tough, I'm from the darkside
And hangin out in the park and in the parkside
Play a brother in any game he wanted to play
For fun or money, for money if he wanted to pay
I wasn't diggin for niggas, so brother, dig deep
If one got over, it's over, I let the kid keep
A little change, it's strange, he want to bet it back
I took his claim to fame, he want to get it back
And when the night was over I took his girl home
I dimmed the lights and showed her that I was bad..

Now I'm in my 20s with plenty money and honey bunnies
20s and 10s, drive a Benz, you can't take nothin from me
Cause I came up on the streets, a straight up poor boy
But I beat the game, but it was war, boy
Because the streets entice you for the wrong things
I couldn't pay the price, I wrote a song theme
And from the moment I touched the microphone
It was known that I was bad to the bone
But weak rappers and a lack of promotion
Made the job hard, I had to throw some
Weak lyrics together, just to get paid
'Go See The Doctor', and I got played
The train continued to the 'Wild, Wild West'
I heard some brothers say, ""He ain't the best""
Huh, but check the records that ain't well known
And look around and see all my clones

By the time I'm in my 30s my worth be - I bet I'm dirty rich
Sittin on the top of the world with about 36
Million in my pocket and rockin it from the mountain top
Livin it at ease, cool breeze, because I'm countin top
Dollar, I'm a scholar seekin knowledge, I'm a truth-seeker
The baddest brother on a microphone and two speakers
On turntables I'm able to start a movement
And when I move the crowd, the ladies move with
Fire in the eyes, the eyes never lie
So feel the fire and desire, keep your eye on the prize
Ladies, listen to the man and watch me work
Fellas, keep your cool when she goes bezerk
Cause I touch em in places that most men don't
Don't get jealous, fellas, oh, that's all she wrote
Then when the night is over you'll be alone

Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
'Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em

If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marly marl can't save you from fallin
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L

Now LL's a laughing stock
'Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, who's' your daddy

Money - the root of all evil
Follow the dollar, and where will it lead to?
Pseudo science, material math
6 degrees of knowledge, brother, you don't know the half
Symbolizin symbolism, excercisin exorcism
Make a little money, now you want to tell me how you're livin
Suckers sellin what you're sellin, now you're sellin out
The devil sold a dream and you bought it without thinkin 'bout
How the beast will decrease the brain wave
With material thoughts from the crib to the grave
Slaves, got you livin just to die
For the money, lookin sweet, slick and sly
Long as you're ridin and your system's fly
You don't give a damn if your homeboys die
So we gotta find a way to get paid in this system
With or without money - with funke funke wisdom

Women - very significant
Power is what she represents
Contrary to what many brothers believe
Learn the metaphysical meaning of Eve
When you get funke wisdom, then you'll understand
The woman is the driving force for any powerful man
>From birth to earth and earth to re-birth
It ain't a curse, put your thought in reverse
Disperse rehearse your medium, verse first
And understand it ain't a purse that can quench your thirst
For love connections and spiritual conceptions
Not a act of x-rated sex, any 
Man without a woman is incomplete
And vice versa she's obsolete
So I make sure within a part of my system
I got funke funke wisdom

To what's left us messed up
Egos dressed up, got us effed up
You see onto instead of into
You see what you want to, instead of what you been through
You can take the rhyme I say
Read it, hand it, see em three ways
Combine the rhyme to anyone of nine
For some still the light won't shine
You can take a shot in the dark, but keep missin
You aim with one eye, you just don't listen
Cause see, in the dark you need all three
Your eyes are ears when you hear what you see
The five senses are all correlated

Full of Africans, sold in America
Now you want me to call myself American
Even though America kill di African
Check it, white man is European
And blackman is African
White man never say Euro-American
So why should the blackman say Afro-American?
If the blackman is American with a afro
Then the white man is American with a long nose
It should be Long-Nose-American for the white man

Make no mistake, we don't shake or stutter
So heed the word of the brothers
Who makes a boy into a man
It's the job of another man
Who knows his role as a father
He bothers to give his son his soul
And pass it on, to never front
Cause papa don't raise no punks
Got to make it know and to pass it down
Yeah, sounds like a job for the brother man now
Got to help a mother for me
Each one teach one, if you can't find one
Talk to the little ones
And you'll see they'll listen

Cause the rhyme is always up to par and on point

Limited lyrical play, gee

Only the deaf, dumb and blind brothers stand still

Shorties with forties, and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasn't
Nothin lyrical, hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters, nothin against your
Fake lifestyle, but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive, cause it's inedited you think it's better with
Explicit illicit lyrics - but like a sedative
The rhymes ain't hype, so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brother's flow's like
So here come the flow, the lovable, huggable, colorful flow
The brother that glows, in the dark, cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows, I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe, the highs and lows

So back up, re-group, slow down and check the cut

I always wondered how a rapper never could wreck shop
But if he had a funky track and a fat hook, he'd get props
Treated like some kind of hero, most of em come no where near Moe
If you call them number one, I know that I got to be zero
I come before the one, I'm second to none
I come in the circumference 360, as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High, you know the rhyme's most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene, I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets, I sinks the ships
So one shot, aye captain, I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin they're mackin, so I pimp-slap em
Showin em who's large in charge, runnin em up outta dodge
This is a hostile take-over, I'm takin over, searg

Cause sellin out ain't nothin new - wait
Cause you can pull a trigger on a nigga well
You think you're bigger, nigga, stop and think you sell
Ain't nothin hard about committin homicide
Cause genocide is really suicide - right?
Well, think about it on a higher - level
You sold your soul and you got hired by a - devil
To reek havoc in the ghetto, y'all go head on

Be like somebody else)

I'm true to the game, so I keep inventin
Hype rhymes for the times and I'm representin
Kick flavor while I'm eatin up the best of em
Then put em in the pile with the rest of em
When I flip it and hit it, some brothers don't get it
They want me to kick it like others - forget it
I tailor-made a style for the microphone
You can search the rap files but it's mine alone
I won't get in to fit in the flow, it's won't simulate
Now bein one of the best causes them to hate
The freestyle master cause I'm a outcast
You ever stop and ask yourself how to outlast
All those before me and the many that came after
The critics who dissed this I dimiss with laughter
Ain't no puzzle, put a muzzle on their face
And watch the hype crowd sing

I worked with Sugarhill Gang, Run and Heavy D

>From '79 to '94, now that's longevity
You got a problem with the flow, here's a remedy
Just sit back, relax, in fact, try to hear it
Cause I'm comin back to back, you gotta wear it
Ain't no sense goin against the grain
Get yourself a surf, dude, ride the wave
Cause this ain't the regular style, ain't no competators, I'll
Take out the negative while just like a predator I'll
Prey and on play on and stay on the airwaves
You heard I'm fallin or fell, chalk it as hear-say
Ain't no defense mechanism or criticism
Capable of doin no nothings here, that's how I'm livin
You can bring whatever you got to bring

Let's Go!

[Verse 2]
Put up or shut up, get up, yeah what up?
Huh, get on the microphone and get cut up
Talk about how your records went double platinum
With those lyrics?! Huh, I laugh at them
So you got paid, take the money you've made
Bet it on yourself, are you afraid?
Money talks, B.S. walks
When I stalk like a hawk a victory is chalked
So put your money where your mouth is, you don't know about this
Battlin's for real men, and I doubt if
You can even hang or give a run for the money
You're just a sucker, and it's funny
How you never ever had a drop of juice in New York
And now you go on tour and try to talk that talk
You try to act like you're a big man, but you're a big fag
Stridin' and hidin' while ridin' my big man
You ain't got a chance in the world
Your records were smokin', but you sound like a girl...
[How you like me now? I'm gettin' busier
I'm double platinum]  Hold up, is he a
Man or a girl? What in the world?
You sound like Cheryl the Pearl
And you want to battle me on the microphone?
Leave that crack alone, let's go...

Let's Go!
I said, Let's Go!
Come on, boy! Let's Go!
Better than me?

[Verse 3]
Picture that with a Kodak
I don't take no shorts and you know that
I roll hard, run the rap yard, put up your guard
I don't get even, I get odd, Todd
Always one up on ya
And I tried to warn ya
You slept, you took a backstep
Ruined your rep and wept, you should've kept
Your mouth shut, you know what?
You gotta say you're sorry  [I'm sorry]  So what?
You call me a punk, you want to see who's soft?
Put the microphone down, let's square-off
You need a hand, you got hands for
Tryna be me, now LL stands for
Lower Level, Lack Lustre
Last Least, Limp Lover
Lousy Lame, Latent Lethargic
Lazy Lemon, Little Logic
Lucky Leech, Liver Lipped
Laborious Louse on a Loser's Lips
Live in Limbo, Lyrical Lapse
Low Life with the loud raps, boy
You can't win, huh, I don't bend
Look what you got yourself in
Just usin' your name I took those L's
Hung 'em on your head and rocked your bells
Now, here we go, blow for blow, let's throw
Rhyme for rhyme, yours and mine, and yo
When it's time to battle rhyme I know
How to make it flow, so let's go
To the ring, rapper's sing and swing
Words and verse, see who deserves to be king
Serve a blow to that ego
As if you didn't know, let's go...

Let's Go!
Let's Go!

[Verse 4]
How can you say you're the best?
Get put to the test in front of a million and fess
Tried to withdraw because you saw
The juice I got's not like before
Huh, I'm formidable, unforgettable
You're submittable, you look pitiful
Yeah you're headstrong, but you're dead wrong
want to survive? Stick with the love songs
Take off your shirt, flex and flirt
And leave the real hard rhymes to the hard rhyme experts
If you don't, boy you'll get hurt
Feel like dirt and have to revert
To comin' on stage butt naked
To make up for what you can't do on record
Open your eyes twice the size and realise
I'm on the rise and you're on the demise
Ostracized by my reprise
Step in my face and watch how that head flies
I mean business and I'm serious
I ain't sellin' out and now here he is
Frontin' and fakin' and talkin' about makin'
The money from money, now don't you know they can
Use your support 'cause you've got caught
Signed, sealed, delivered, sold and bought
A puppet on a string with no heart
A fool and his money will always part
You used to be a rapper, turned into a businessman
Loafin' on the job and cheatin' the fans
I'm too potent, powerful and spiritual
Mental, emotional, physical and lyrical
You want to beat me? It's gonna take a miracle
You've got a lock on my jock like a pitbull",Let's Go

Kool Savas,"A du mi! Ladies und Gentlemen, hier spricht Moses Pelham, CEO von 3P.
Und ich möcht' die Gelegenheit nutzen um Euch einen 
Meiner Lieblingskollegen zu präsentieren, der,
Wenn ich nur früh erkannt hätte, dass man großen, 
Wahnsinnigen Junkie-Spinnern keinen Teil des Geschäfts überlassen darf,
Sicher heute bei 3P wär'. 
Das ist 'ne traurige Geschichte! Tröste mich, Savas!

S, Du Groupie, wie jedes deutsche Kiddie, das rappt. 
Ich steh' auf um zwölf, ess' Mittag um sechs,
geh' in's Studio, spit' und mach' Tracks, mach' mein Ding. 
Dich am Mikro problemlos zu töten ist gar kein Ding.
Ich bin kein Pop-Rapper, ich bin der Top Rapper, mit Hauptschulabschluss 
In der Tasche ist mein Job Rapper.
Ich mach' mir Sorgen, Deine Freundin ist seltsam, 
Sie bläst dicks wie eine Hure und will nicht einmal Geld haben.
Hobby-Hoe, Du bist im Fick-Business, mach' big Business. 
Ich krieg' Pussy ohne Ende, ich muss nicht mehr wichsen.
Ich flow' besser als Perish damals auf diesem Beat 
und mir geht's besser heute ohne Deal bei Put da Needle.
Was Ihr macht, ist kein Rap, des ist Ambient. 
Ich bin kein normaler Rapper mehr, ich bin der Champion.
Manchmal fühl' ich mich, als wenn ich jemand ermorden will, doch chille, spitte, bringe Rapper zum weinen wie Lauryn Hill, oh!

Ja, geweint hat er dann auch immer, einfach so, ohne jeden Grund.
Aber Du tröstest mich, Savas, Du machst meine Welt schöner,
Du machst Hip Hop schöner. Du bist wunderschön! Mach' weiter so, bitte!

Bitte fuck mich ab, ich brauch einen Grund zum schreiben. 
Mein Flow ist dirty und nasty wie ein Mund voll Scheiße.
Ich komm' zum Battle, spit' einen Vers, fick' Dich im Nu. 
Deine Freundin bläst hart wie auf Didgeridoos.
Du machst komische Moves, weil Du glaubst, Fame ist geil. 
Ich mach's wie Jada.
Gib Money, kiss the game, goodbye!
Tut mir leid, ich bin der King, 
Bin der Boss, bin der Champ, bin der Chef, 
Mein schwächster Vers ist Dein bester Vers.

Trauer, mein Flow ist für Euch nicht nachzuvollziehen, 
Ich versuch nur härter als hart zu spitten und hart zu verdienen.
Ich geb' keinen Fick, ich bin selber mein favourite Rapper. 
Ich bin ein Idol für die Jugend wie H.P. Baxter.
Ich bin nicht Hollywood, greif' mir nicht in's Steuer, mein Freund. 
Ich geb' hier die Richtung an, mein Flow straight Feuer für Euch.
Ich burn' Dich, ich kill' Euch, leg' 
Euch zwischen zwei Sandwich-Hälften. 
Deine Karriere, guck', Dir kann kein Mensch mehr helfen.
Rap', Du Loser, Du brauchst einen exactly Co-Producer. 
Schreib', was Du willst, doch Dein Text ist der letzte Dreck wie die U-Bahn.
Ich spiel' das Game wie Ego-Shooter, allein gegen Euch. 
Du willst nicht mein Feind sein, mein Feund, Homie!

Ja, exactly, Du produzierst das Stichwort, Mann. 
Du weißt, wie's ist, Savas, und 
Du sagst, wie's ist, sehr schön!
Mir geht s schon viel besser! 
Change that beat a one more time, 
Katch Money, tu' was für unseren Clan!
Let s go! S A V! Komm', komm'! 

Sieh', der Mac ist back, ich rippe Mics, spitte Lines. 
Respekt ist was schönes, doch ich will von Euch Fickern keinen.
Ihr hört mein Album und liebt es wie Billy Jean und Beat it. 
Ich komm' und splatter' jeden Rapper am Mikro, meet the Fible.
//Guck', der Beat ist aus Cash-Sampler, ich rap' länger, bring' 
Euch Rap-Banger, F-d-s-Wämmer, des ist Set-Anger.
Spit' so schizo, rhyme so psycho, ich geh' in's Studio, 
Mach' irgendwas, schlag' die Zeit tot,
schlag' Dich wie Eis tot, schlag' Dich am Mic tot. 
Ich bin fame, mein Name ist jeden Tag in der Zeitung.
Ich rap' nicht, ich red' nur, ich bin, wie ich bin, ich kling', wie ich kling'. 
Du klingst, wie ich kling', ich kling' wie der King, ah.
Du bist DJ, ruf' mich an, ich spitt' für ein paar Hundert, 
Laufe durch die Stadt wie der Prinz von Zamunda.
Ihr seid verwundert, fragt dies und das. 
Du bist ein Hater, weil Du zu viel redest, zu viel hasst, oh!

You are never lot, homie, Du bist eine Inspiration, 
Eine Motivation zugleich, Du hast mich gerade inspiriert.
Du motivierst mich dazu nächsten Sommer Geteiltes Leid zwo zu droppen. 
Und was motiviert Dich, mein Freund?

Bitte fuck' mich ab, des ist meine Motivation, wegen 
Euch Idioten mach' ich bald meine erste Million.
Ihr guckt mich an, als wär ich Alien, wie 
Vom anderen Planeten, seit dem Cometen fangen 
Leute an mit mir anders zu reden.
Sie sind alle so nice, so höflich und nett, 
Ich geh' an's Mic und ruf' Fotze und Schwanz, als hätt' ich Durett.
Ich bin der einzige Rapper, den ich kenn', 
Der was kann, der was ist, der was liebt, der was will, 
Der was macht und es sich holt.
Guck', Du bist so stumpf, dass Du nichts mehr merkst. 
Ich spit' wie Bartman, fick' unfassbar pervers.
Ich bin kein Freestyler, ich rappe einen Part und over. 

Wenn ich komme, ist für euch Party over. Go home!
Ich sag' in einfachen Worten, was Ihr im Studium lernt. 
Mein Flow ist Killer doch Ihr seid meine Kugeln nicht wert.
Du läufst verzweifelt umher und suchst nach dem Sinn der Sachen, 
Während ich gerad' dabei bin Deiner Frau ein Kind zu machen.
Ich komm' in ihr und auf ihr, komm', wann ich will, 
Wie ich will, wo ich will, komm' in ihr Face auf Klo, wenn ich will.
Egal, ich hab' Dir nichts mehr zu sagen, Du Punk. 
Merk' Dir einfach nur meinen Namen, du Punk! S A!
Ja, A du mi!",Transatlantic
Kool Savas,"Wer ist es? Wer bin ich?
Der King der Kings der euch Pints pimpt, Big Binnezz
Ihr seid dick billig, spittet nur kindische Pisse Lyrics ohne Sinn
Ich flow sick wie sicker als Tricky, crazy wie Rainman, ok man, du bist gay, man
Ihr wart schon lange genug im Game aber jetzt müsst ihr gehen, man
Jetzt ist alles vorbei! Bye, Ciao, ihr Penner traut euch nicht ran
Denn ich drop Killer Verses von Blättern wie Tau
Deine Frau dreht die Runden wie die Zeiger ner Uhr und beim allem Respekt
Diese Bitch ist leider ne Hure, die Schlampe liebt die Cocks
Sie nimmt den Schwanz in die Hand und läuft aus, wie der Rand bei einer Cheesy Crust, Player
Ich weiß, ich bin für euch Schmocks der King
Ich battle einer gegen fünf als wär ich Rodney King
Du boxt im Ring aber saugt Dicks in der Kabine
Du spielst Pullerfighten mit deinem Boy und wichst ihm seinen Riemen, egal
Nach Bad wollte ich mit Michael tour’n
Heute verbreite ich auf Tour die Wahrheit wie Michael Moore
Und hitte diese Beats anormal formvollendet
Bis ihr neben mir ekelhaftter klingt als Oxford English

Ich schreibe zwei Zeilen komm und zieh dich in meinen Bann
Ich spucke drei Lines flow raub dir deinen Verstand
Bring dir die Highlights in 04 und 05 Homie

Step in das Spiel und schieße euch wie Kobe kaputt
Ihr seid wie Eintagsfliegen, ihr kommt und geht, Junge
Ich komm und steh Junge und bomb das Game immer noch
Ich rolle wie ein Panzer über das Feld und stehe solide
Schlage ein wie ein Metroid in deinen Speaker, kommt folgt dem Leader
Das ist das einzigartige, ich pump Volt in Glieder, ahh
Tune den Flow wie Brabus, ich sag euch wann es abgeht wie Startschuss, POW!
Zeigt euch allen wo es langgeht, ich pump neues Styles im Studio bis das Land bebt
Komm mit mir, du hast keinen Flair, nenn dich wie du willst
Du bist für mich ein Punk nicht mehr, Junge
Glaub mir ich mach dich kaputt, denn jeder deiner Zeilen wird verschmort wie Plastik, du Futt!

Komm mit uns auf diesen Trip, sag, fühlt ihr diesen Hit?
Es macht nur noch tick, tick, BOOM und ihr seid alle gefickt
Außer uns ist alles Mist, alles ein Witz, sonst nix
Nickt mit bis eure Hälse brechen wie Drumsticks
One fickt

Ohne Erbarmen, alles was jemals da war
Wir kamen, sahen, siegten und sprengten euren Rahmen
Es gibt einen Namen und keinen zweiten, zeig mir nur einen
Nimm das Mic, dann zeig ich’s euch beiden, Junge
Begreif

Wir sind die Nummer eins, Number one. Ihr wollt an uns ran?
Dann fangt mal an, tanz mal an mit euren zwanzig Hampelmann
Schlagt die Köpfe an die Wand bis sie platzen wie Bubblegums
Keine Angst, jetzt geht’s rund wie ’ne Achterbahn
Halt dich fest!

Denn Bruder, unsere Scheiße ist der Ultimate
Wir killn jedes Battle und sind lauter als Revolverschüsse
Klick, klack, BOOM - wir sind back, rulen
Das Game ohne Probleme, denn dies ist Rap pur
BOOM!

Wenn ihr uns wollt, wenn ihr uns liebt
Hebt die Hände hoch, wenn’s für euch nur uns gibt

Kool Savas,"Ich spuck Napalm, seit Tag Eins gegen den Strom. Ich gebe den Ton an
Die Ein-Mann-Armee rappt jeden ins Koma
Ich bring Rap back und ihr kriegt mentale Krisen
Ich helle euren dunklen Tage auf mit meinem Licht, wenn ich Rapresentiere
Rap zelebriere das ist Mein Leben, mein Block, meine Gegend
Junge, wir sind (Number One)
Der Kaiser, die Faust des Nordwestens, der Bozz
Kommt und fickt euch ihr Pisser
Fieh! Du hast keine Chance, Gib auf!
Dies ist A, Junge - es macht BANG!
Guck den Feuersturm an, wie er kommt, um dich zu burnen
Fühl' den Schmerz und die Ruhe vor dem Sturm in meinem Vers
Sieh' mein Kugelhagel kennt allein den Kurs zu deinem Herz, Homie
Ich bringe unaufhaltsam Drama in das Fotzengame
Der Peiniger hat kein Erbarmen - heut' ist Judgement-Day
Zahltag, Nutte jetzt wirst du gebumst
Steig' wie Phönix aus den Flammen auf und feier' mein' Triumph. (Dies ist RAP)!

Jemand wie S, Bei mir seid ihr richtig - Willkommen im Game
Ich änder das Game - Guck! - Eure besten Tage sind gezählt
Ihr schwulen Rapper - geht in Therapie oder werft paar Exedrin
Bitte Don't hate, denn wenn ich spitte, gibt es kein Gegenmittel. Baby - Gib auf
Wenn du den Sinn der Sache nich' peilst. Geh und Kauf
Kauf mein Album. Ich Keep it Gangsta, Dreckig und Tight
Warum rappst du, du musst noch üben auf dem Weg zum Ziel
Sie sagen, Lass Rap Wenn... Du nicht mehr willst
Aber Dunne, Ich weiß nicht wie ich bin
Alle in einem, Es reicht, ein Rhyme
Als würd' ich Tränengas auf euch schießen. Und ihr fangt an zu weinen
Ruft: Nein! No, Tillt ab wie Joe

Und es ist einfach makaber, denn
Ich weiß ohne mich wären heute noch alle MCs auf grüner Pass und goldener Adler. Nenn'
Mir nur einen wie mich, es gibt keinen wie mich
Ich spitte und zeig' dir, wie scheiße du bist
Sie hören, was ich sage, doch begreifen es nicht
Ich sage es ganz langsam, eigens für dich. Ich bin Rap
Sieh es ein. Geh heim und fahr dir ONE's LP rein
Oder rewind that Track and bow

Das Game ist nicht mehr, was es war, seitdem ich da bin. Ich hab' es verändert
Sieh wie heute Rap hier auf der Straße ist
Mein Junge, ich seh dich wachsen, bin stolz wie dein Vater
Ich hab' den Weg für dich geebnet als sonst keiner für dich da war
Ich zog das Schwert aus dem Stein, was sonst keiner vermochte
Brachte die Straße in die Charts als ich A rockte
Ich hab' die Tür geöffnet, ihr folgt mir hindurch
Der Bozz zeigt euch, wo es lang geht, Junge, das ist, was ich tue (Ich bin Rap)

Kool Savas,"Dies ist eine Story über Möwen und Fliegen
Löwen und Bienen, ein Verse wie ein Wald voller schöner Tiere
Und zwar so, dein Hühnchen bittet mich sie jede Nacht zu knallen
Und ich geb’ ihr die Schlange, lass sie singen wie ’ne Nachtigal
Überhart, sprinte los wie ein Gepard
Hol mir schnell ’ne Gazelle, leg sie flach wie ein Rochen
Ochs’ sie wie ein Bock und mach’n Fisch
Schrei „du Affe“, doch das macht mir nichts
Denn im Grunde bis du nur ein armes Schwein, das Menschenkacke frisst
Und der Mensch ermordet Tiere, weil er kacke ist
Und unser Hirn nicht erheblich größer als das vom Dackel ist
Fuck it, ich mach mehr Feinde platt, als ein Tausendfüssler Beine hat
Mein Album kommt wie ein Mammut der Scheiße droppt. (Boom!)
Ich pack das Game am Kragen, wie ein Kraken
Schleuder es rum und lass euch glotzen wie Karpfen
Guck, diesen tierischen Part hier findet sogar dein Papa geil
Der Lion King ist hier, komm und sag’s mir nach wie ein Papagei

Uh ahah
Ihr seid ein gefundenes Fressen
Wir sind hier im Dschungel die besten

Sieh mich an du kleiner Kackvogel, der Löwe ist back
Komm pruste dich nur weiter auf, ich komm und vögel dich weg
Dies is mein Reich, Junge, du kannst bellen, ich kann bellen und beißen
Ich werd dir zeigen, was es heißt zu reißen
Ich verbeiß mich in dein Fleisch und reiß es raus wie der große Weiße
Ich weiß, dass du es brauchst du kleiner Hosenscheißer
Mein Revolvergebiss, läd jeden Zahn, der bricht, nach
Ich splitte dein Gesicht wie ein Blitzschlag
Ich steh am Ende der Nahrungskette
Und warte mit Heißhunger auf den Tag, an dem du kommst und ich dich fresse
Meine Jungs sind wie Piranhas, gib ihn keinen Anlass
Unsere Gewässer kreuzt du besser nicht, Junge glaub mir!
Ich bin ein Raubtier ohnegleichen mit Zähnen aus Eisen
Und Drüsen voll Gift, das ich spritze in dein scheiß Gesicht
Dir geht der Mut aus und du bist erschrocken
Ich bin geborener Killer, voll in meinem Blutrausch und nicht mehr zu stoppen

Aber ich zieh euch aus dem Verkehr wie ein Grizzly die Lachse
Ich bin wie Gänse auf Achse, such nach 'nem Ort
Wo sich heiße Bienen versammeln, wie Zebras in einer Horde
Ich morde nicht, ich jage dich, beiß dir ins Genick und
Zieh dich auf’n Baum, zernage dich und kau an dir paar Tage, Bitch!
Das sind einfach die Gesetze des Dschungels
Und meine Hunde woll’n nicht rufen, sie bellen nach ihrem Jungen
Jap jap!

Ich hab die Beißkraft eines Alligators
Beiß dich in der Mitte durch, nur um dann zu sehen wie du Affe klarkommst
Lass dein Kadaver für die Geier da, denn ich bin fertig mit dir!
Ich hab’s dir gesagt, du Ratte wirst erbärmlich krepieren
Ich bin gepanzert wie ein Nashorn, geht mir aus’m Weg!
Ich reiß deine Bauchdecke auf, nimm dich aus und geh
Kein Tier das ich zu fürchten habe, Depp ich dominier
Fick dich wie ein Stier, wohin denn dies is mein Revier

Und Click, Clack, Brap bis ihr weg seid wie VHS

Mit diesem Flow, der von dir nicht mehr als Knochen übrig lässt
Ruft eure Truppen, denn ich drop Bomben in der Booth
Bis Napalm auf dich prasselt, als würdest du gerade duschen
Ich lade, schieß und treff dich und back dich
Pack dich auf den Esstisch und ess dich!
Ich mach Klarschiff hier an Bord mit meinen Jungs wie Bush
Du willst nicht mitzieh'n, aber musst, wie 'ne Pussy im Puff
Ihr schießt doch nur in die Luft, extra vorbei
Wir machen's wie die Barbaren, und kommen mit Äxten vorbei
Bald ist dieser Text hier vorbei, aber der Krieg geht weiter
Ich schick euch ABC-Bomben um euer Bewusstsein zu erweitern
Guck, ich fahr über euch wie Ketten von Panzern
Ihr seid nicht nur wack wie am Anfang
Ich schick euch back zu dem Anfang
Mit diesem Track wie ein Anschlag
Ihr wollt, dass wir Respekt oder Angst ham?
No way, ich versenk euch Kecks wie ein Anker
Ich sprüh vor lauter Energie wie Blanka
Dreh ab und geh hoch in der Bucht von Istanbul wie ein Tanker, Boom!

Führe meinen Feldzug in dein Areal
Blut fließt, Junge flieh!
Kein Peace, du siehst den Tod, wenn ich komme, sieh
Dein Körper geht zu Boden bei der Druckwelle meiner Bombe
Ich schlage die Trommeln des Krieges, bis der Stock bricht
Und geb dir auf die Ohren bist du blickst, wer der Bozz ist!
Ich hab dich im Visier, es gibt kein Spekulieren
Ich lade das Panzerrohr und lass dein Scheißlager detonieren
Du willst mich burnen mit deiner Kerze, ich bring Flammenwerfer
Und setz dich in Brand bis dich kein Schwanz mehr erkennt
Sieh mein Mikro hat nicht ohne Grund so viele Kerben
Ich bin Schütze, meine Schüsse sind präzise
Sieh, dies ist Armageddon, Junge, ich hab Sprengsätze die dich
Hart zerschmettern, Junge, glaub mir!
Es wird nicht lustig, wenn der Spaß einmal begonnen hat
Ich fliege über dein Bataillon, Junge, und lasse meine Bomben ab
Nenn mich Achilles, weil ich alleine die Schlacht schlage
Gegen deine komplette Stadt
Der letzte Samurai im Dschungel des Asphalts
Junge, nenn mich Ghost Dog, ich mach jeden von euch kalt!

Is' das nich tragischer als das, schade, hol den Nagellack
Und strapse und stell' dich 'ma nachts zu den Schlampen an Straßenrand

Wir sind on top und überrollen euch Gesocks wie'n Wagenrad
Hör' auf und warte mal, nein, ich kann nich, ich lade nach
Und des wird unbehaglicher, als ob die kühle Saison des Jahres naht
Es hagelt und ist nass, kälter als 'n Behälter Häagen-Dazs
Rap ist zwar am Sack, doch ich Regel das, das ist der Beweis

Mein Flow ist wie warmer Samen, voll ins Gesicht
Über-pervers, ihr fragt nur weswegen
Was ist der zwingende Grund

Es gibt kein', der springende Punkt, der sich wie Donner, der bibbernde Hund
Laber' nich bitte, du Spinner bist dumm
Und nichts mehr bitten, Dinner is' um
Aber falls ihr nich versteht, wovon ich red', wie wär's mit 
Nimm' ihn in den Mund
Du hast nicht mal den geringsten Schimmer
Du Futt laberst dauernd, bei dir heißt ein Mal die Stunde, abends Party-After-Hour, Trauer
Ich mach mein Ding, bring' euch Energie geballt wie'n Laser
Du machst Fitness, dann trink' dein Protein-Shake aus 'nem alten Präser

Kommt und ich schlag euch gern wie Malteser
Ein Wort, bitte lass Federn, ich dagegen flow', was, fehlerfrei, was
Jeder Idiot hier glaubt, dass er hype is', nich' mit mir,schweig
Und verneig' dich, wann kommt ihr Schweine zur Einsicht, es gibt nur Einen und sonst kein'
S zu dem A V A S, ihr werdet bleich, zieht die Luft an wie'n Reifen
Ich mein', muss ich euch wirklich noch was beweisen? Nein!",Der Beweis
Kool Savas,"Meine Damen und Herrn (Essah Essah)
Ich präsentiere Ihnen heut', jetzt und hier
Den unbestrittenen Schwergewichts-rap-champion (Essah Essah)
Euren besten Freund, den King of Rap, die Eins
Den Chef im Ring, den größten der größten
Halt'! Ihr könnt's einfach nicht mehr ignorieren
Er ist essah als ihr.

Ab heute heißt besser nicht mehr besser, sondern essah
Denn essah beschreibt besser, besser als besser, ich mein essah, als besser
Und darum wäre es essah, wenn du essah wirst
Oder essah noch dich vor den Spiegel stellst und selbst erwürgst
Essah so oder nicht, jetzt ist es essah als davor
Ihr hört diese Zeilen und fragt, was hat S.A.V. davor?
Ich will euch grad' nicht verwirren, sondern alles essah machen
Essah ihr macht das, was ihr könnt und lasst's S.A. essah machen
Ruf essah S.O.S, denn S.A. isst euch alles weg vom Kuchen
Wie die Raupe Nimmersatt 'nen Blatt zu ihrem Dinner
Warte, essah nicht abschweifen Essah ihr S.A.
Klone macht auf flott, Flott alles noch abgreifen
Essah so für euch Mitesser, diese Musik hier existiert nur mit S.A.
Ich konkurriere nicht mit dir, Fickfresse
Und nichts könnt es besser beschreiben als diese letzten Zeilen
Ich bin essah, bleib essah und werd' immer essah bleiben

Wer denkt, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und sag
Wer meint, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und bitte
Wer glaubt, er wär' essah als S.A.?
Bring' ihn her!
Wer denkt, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und sag
Wer meint, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und bitte
Wer glaubt, er wär' essah als S.A.?
Bring' ihn her!

Ich kann nachvollziehen, warum ihr Stress macht
Denn mit jedem meiner Alben geht's für euch direkt runter wie Aaliyahs Cessna
Vergesst mal essah nicht, ihr seid die Saat, die ich bewässer'
Und deswegen gibt es jedes Jahr so viele neue Rapper
Sie finden, S. hot, wollen haben, was S, hat
Mein Style ist für sie wie Jessica Alba, ihnen geht einer bei S. ab
Gut, ihr seid gut, doch es gibt S.A. nicht essah als Tester
Jedoch als eure ausgelutschte Scheiße von gestern
Und ehrlich, jetzt mal ernsthaft ihr versucht mir härter zu gleichen
Als Mary-Kate ihrer Schwester, in Ordnung nicht ganz, aber in etwa
Ich spitt' technisch essah als es sogar Inspektor Gadget kann
Mein Flow ist ein feuchter Traum wie das Video zu Fiesta
Guck' ich werde nicht älter nur essah gibt’s hier, nicht ruhiger nur fester
Dieses Spiel ist mein Labor und ich der irre Professor
Form, formvollendete Texte nach Formeln extra für euch
Doch ihr wisst es nicht zu schätzen, denn ihr wisst es ist nicht essah

Wer denkt, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und sag
Wer meint, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und bitte
Wer glaubt, er wär' essah als S.A.?
Bring' ihn her!
Wer denkt, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und sag
Wer meint, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und bitte
Wer glaubt, er wär' essah als S.A.?
Bring' ihn her!",Essah
Kool Savas,"Wir sind krank und ich mein' nicht den Rap ausm Süden
Ich mein', dass was wir täglich in der Glotze sehn
Das ganze Übel macht uns krank
Doch es reflektiert nur, was wir sind, egal ob Vater, Mutter oder Kind
Wir sind alle, wir sind alle krank
Wären gern' gesund aber wissen nicht mehr wie
Zwischen Lügen, Drogen, Fun, Partytime und Hysterie
Zwischen Krieg, Eltern, Ärger, Arbeit und Psychiatrie
Zwischen wir wollen hier sein und gleichzeitig fliehen
Ist des nicht alles krank?
Doch is' es und wir wissen's
Wir sind kranke, kaputte Menschen im Fernsehen
Und finden des witzig, ehrlich, das ist krank
Vater und Sohn heiraten und schwören sich ewige Treue bei Olli Geißen,
Perverse Scheiße, das ist krank
Mit 13 das erste mal Gang Bang , das ist krank
Menschen töten Menschen für ein Land, das ist krank
Kein Dach über'n Kopf, Manche leben auf der Bank, krank
Keine Hoffnung, Leute saufen sich um den Verstand, krank
Andere bestimmen über dein Leben, das ist krank
Du sagst die Wahrheit, aber sie lassen dich nicht reden, das ist krank
Der eine hat alles, der andere nichts, krank
Einige sprechen nur noch mit Waffen, ist das nicht krank?
Manche verlieren vor lauter Schmerzen den Verstand
Suchen Hilfe bei Ärzten, die nicht helfen wollen, das ist krank
Wir fühlen uns wie verloren, warten auf Hilfe von oben
Lindern die Symptome durch Drogen, obwohl wir wissen
Des ist, des ist, des ist krank

Wie wir hier leben, unsere Verfassung, der ständige Kampf in uns und mit jedem
Das macht uns krank
All' diese Regeln, die Überwachung, Mauern und Käfige, die uns umgeben
Das macht uns krank
Das Glück, nach dem alle streben, wir kriegen's nicht zu fassen
Suchen's vergebens und verzweifeln
Das macht uns krank
Wir hoffen und beten, heben die Waffen und zerstören uns gegenseitig
Weswegen? Denn wir sind krank

Und ich red' nicht von Prothesen und Krücken,
Ich mein' unser Wesen, die meisten von uns sind geistige Krüppel.
Verwirrt, weil uns keiner wirkliche Werte vermittelt
Sie meinen, was wir wert sind, misst sich an dem, was wir besitzen
Is' das nich krank?
Wir werden reingeboren in diese kranke Welt
In der man dich, wenn du gegen das Kranke kämpfst, für den Kranken hält
Keine Entwicklung, wir sind Schafe, folgen den Hirten
Nehmen seine Medizin ein und versprechen uns Wirkung, aber das ist krank
Drogen machen krank, Gier macht uns krank
Keine Liebe innerhalb der Familie, das macht uns krank
Der Hass in uns, den sie schüren, wird zum Geschwür und macht krank
Blut, das wir vergießen, Kriege, die wir führen, machen krank
Was? Eltern erziehen Kinder durch Schläge, das ist krank
Fast niemand ist glücklich mit seinem Leben, das ist krank
Wir sind krank, voller Panik, Ängsten und Wahnsinn
Und fügen uns selber Schmerzen zu um zu fühlen, dass wir da sind
Das ist krank

Beuten Tiere aus, machen sie zu des Menschens Sklaven
Quälen sie, töten sie und essen dann ihre Kadaver, das ist krank
Arroganz, Ignoranz, das ist alles krank
Herzlosigkeit, Neid, Gefühlskälte ist krank
Zwänge, Depression, Volksverdummung, Rassentrennung, wir sind krank
Kennen keine Grenzen, Menschen hassen Menschen, fühlen sich verloren
Suchen Hilfe von oben, lindern die Symptome durch Drogen
Obwohl sie wissen das ist, das ist, das ist krank

Kool Savas,"Ich weiß, sie wünschen sich, ich würde einfach aufhör'n und geh'n
Sie hören, mein Album ist draußen und ihnen laufen die Tränen
Des ist kein Ding, ich kann das gut versteh'n, des is' ultra OK
Ihr glaubt, ich respektier' euch nicht, nur weil ich euch unter mir seh'
Das stimmt nicht, ich respektier' jeden, der nichts kann und was tut
Denn nichts zu können, aber tun als ob, könnt ihr schon unfassbar gut
Wirklich, und könnt ich euch irgend möglich helfen, würd' ich's
Mein Tipp, geht zu Roncalli Records, die suchen noch Clowns in ihrem Zirkus
Diese Zeilen hier widme ich euch tief aus dem Herz'
Und ihr denkt, ich scherze nur, glaubt, ich mein', das alles nicht ernst
Doch das tu' ich, guck' ich fluch' nicht über ihr Gangster-Gehabe
Ihnen fehlt die Eingebung, wie Tastaturen, die kein Enter mehr haben
Sie sind dumm, ich hör', was sie sagen und find's zum Lachen
Was ich mache, lässt sie gleich verstummen
Denn neben mir sind diese Jungs nur Fucker wie Pints
Und ich hab' auf Gerechtigkeit gehofft, aber es gibt sie nicht
denn diese Typen haben meine Musik gefickt, deswegen fick ich sie zurück

Kein Herz, keine Melodie
Womit hab ich das verdient?
Ich hab sie mal so geliebt
Aber sie haben diese Mucke gefickt
Kein Herz, keine Melodie
Womit hab ich das verdient?
Ich hab sie mal so geliebt
Aber sie haben diese Mucke gefickt

Ihr verbreitet Mörderstuss, erzählt von Hörgenuss
Stimmt, ich genieß' die Mucke, die ihr macht sehr
Wenn ich sie nich hören muss
Ich weiß ihr sucht nach Publikum, geht auf Myspace und Youtube und
Tut auf cool und macht 'rum wie sonst, was ihr lauft doch nicht mehr rund
Doch keine Sorge hier kommt S.A. Hawking,
Der Norton Anti-Virus des Raps und stopf' ihre Mäuler in null Komma nichts wie Korken
Ihr wollt nachdem hier was landen, doch kriegt'n Korb und merkt
Ihr seid nich' mehr angesagt wie für ultra-fette Säue 'ne Riesentorte
Ich hingegen mach', was ich will, fahr' meinen Film
Und bin am Schrauben mit den Silben und Worten, Sätzen und Strophen
Euer Dreck kommt wie Briketts in den Ofen, versuch' mich nachzuahmen
Es geht nich', da sich deine Zunge bei dieser Art von Text verknotet
Deswegen klingt ihr doch so primitiv und so barbarisch
Glaubt mir, wenn ich mit dir fertig bin, steht vor deinem Namen ehemalig
Ich muss hier Gerechtigkeit schaffen, ansonsten gibt’s sie nich'
Denn diese Typen haben meine Musik gefickt, deswegen fick' ich sie zurück

Kool Savas,"Ich komm' auf die Bühne, leg' Hand ans Mic
Fang' langsam an und demolier' dich am Ende wie Van Damme
Geh', hol deine Gun, dann wär's fair
Doch bis dahin is' das Einzige, was du gewinnst nur Land, man
Guck', euer Gerede macht müde wie der Sandmann
Ob Türke, Russe oder der Rest von Grand Can
Bei jedem finden diese Tracks Anklang
Aber was ist des? Deine Bitch hat 'ne Loch wie'n Schuss von 'ner Pump-gun
Na dann, viel fun, man
Ich an deiner Stelle würd sie am Rand stehenlassen wie'n Wandschrank
Egal, kein Tam Tam, wahrt den Anstand
Meine Texte ficken alles wie Matrosen auf Landgang
Für mich ist Rappen wie wandern, S läuft
Und ich bediene gerne euer Team alleine die Bank lang
Danke an alle, die mein Talent verkannt haben
Heute seht ihr wohl alles anders, wie in 'nem Handstand, oder nich'?

Niemals kriegt ihr mich weg, nie wieder geh ich
Keiner von euch kann's wie dieser Typ ist Da Vinci
Und das hier ist meine Mona-Lisa
Des Original, die Eins, niemals von ihm kopiert
Aber niemals erreicht, ihr meint ihr seid's
Doch kommt nicht ran an Mona-Lisa

Ich renn' durch Beats wie'n Athlet
Ich nehm' Wörter und Silben und kann sie im Takt dreh'n
Des ist 'n Fetisch, ähnlich wie bei Leuten, die auf Leder und Lack stehen
Ich kann mich an meinen Texten nicht satt sehen
Ich hab den übelsten dich-glatt-bügelnden Flow
Alles, was ich rappe, muss zack, zack, zack gehen
Sie wollen mein Album mehr als Miss Milian nackt sehen
Feature mit dir? Ich muss ablehnen
Was geht? Alle nennen dich Kackface
Als würde dein Kopf unmittelbar hinter dem Sack kleben
mich will jeder wie 'ne Wiese plattmähen
mich batteln lass, wie bei nem Liebesakt blähen
Was gees? Ich bin dabei süß wie Natreen
Merke! Ich spieß' sie auf wie Kakteen
Ihr habt mies verkackt, wen willst du besiegen?
Nich' mich, lass' dir 'n Sarg zimmern und Frack nähen, denn

Kool Savas,"Ich kann nicht noch mal reseten, mein Leben zurückdrehen
Wie der Prince of Persia und mich fragen
Will ich einen Job als Rapper?
Paar sind gescheitert, nicht paar, 
Viele diese Player waren nicht in der Lage dieses Spiel zu spielen
Deswegen blick ich auf sie runter wie im alten GTA
Schieße auf sie wie in Doom, hoff', dass ich sie nie wieder seh'
Auf diesen Wegen gibt es mehr Gegner als im Survival Mode
Ich stecke sie weg mit diesen Rhymes und Flows
Und spitte so perfekt, par excellence
Das ist mein Wurf vor dem Schluss, die letzte Chance
D'rum geb ich Stoff wie in 'nem Kart mit drei Pilzen
In diesem Spiel hier bildet man sich manchmal die Freunde ein wie in Wilson
Mein Flow lässt dich schmelzen und verbrennt die Schmocks
Ich werd' zum Irren und spring auf sie wie der Bandicot
Ihr gebt Gas, bremst und hockt mir am Hintern, doch kommt leider nicht vorbei
Denn ich bin auf 'nem anderen Level, ihr Schweine

Sie sagen Rap wär' nur ein Spiel, das ist alles nur ein Game, gut
Ich spiele gerne mit und setze mein Leben

Jetzt heißt es, alles oder nichts

Ich will die große Kohle nicht, eure Monopoly Scheine
Spit' eine Todeszeile, sie fallen um wie Dominosteine
Zieht bloß wieder Leine und folgt eurer Mission wie Lara Croft
Ihr labert oft, doch habt nichts zu sagen, ihr Versager
Ich meine, Verlierer, ihr spielt in den Texten die Gangster
Schiebt euch den Film als wärt ihr gerade in 'nem Action-Adventure
Was auch kommt, ich halt die Pads in der Hand und steiger' mich täglich
Am Ende des Weges fügt alles sich zusammen wie Tetris
Wir spielen dieses Spiel hier mit, übernehmen es wie Cortax
Optik Army, paar Jungs und ein Mädchen wie Mario Brothers
Ihr macht auf Street Fighter doch kommt nie weiter, nicht viel weiter als bis hier
Ich nehm' euch Call of Duty mäßig ins Visier und
Snipe euch wie Moorhühner, diese Art von Schüssen hält nicht mal dein bester Torhüter
Ihr gebt euch geschlagen, bevor das Battle begonnen hat
Für jeder meiner Taten verdien' ich die Medal of Honor

Kool Savas,"Du bist on Top, my man
Du hast einfach, was der Rest nicht hat, my man
Was auch immer du dir vornimmst, es klappt my man
Mach nur dein Ding und never give up my man
Yes, don´t stop my man
Du bist on Top, my man,
Du hast einfach, was der Rest nicht hat, my man
Was auch immer du dir vornimmst, es klappt my man
Mach nur dein Ding und never give up my man
Yes, don´t stop my man
Du bist on Top my man!

Wir fühlen uns einsam und leer
Denken manchmal, dass die gesamte Welt hier gegen uns wär'
Sehen nur noch Regen und Gewitter, graue Wolken am Himmel und in unseren Köpfen
Manche glauben, dass sie kein Glück haben und geben auf
Sind verbittert und nicht mehr bereit für ihr Schicksal zu kämpfen
Wir wünschen uns den Respekt anderer Menschen
Und etwas Liebe und Anerkennung, Hilfe und Wertschätzung
Die Kraft, die wir daraus schöpfen, nichts könnte sie eher ersetzen
Jeder ist ein Gewinner auf seine eigene Art
Durch die Dinge, die wir meistern an jedem einzelnen Tag
Und bist du mal am Boden, geht dein Blick nur noch nach oben
An die Spitze, on Top
Du bist voller Wissen und Kraft, nutze sie tu was
Und auch, wenn du nicht gleich an dein Ziel gelangst
Hab' keine Angst, lass deine Träume nicht un-versucht
Es geht nicht d'rum, was jemand anderes macht
Du stehst nur für dich
Glaub' an dich und du packst jegliche Hürde, sag dir nur

Du bist on Top, my man

Du bist on Top my man!

Klopf' den Dreck von deiner Kleidung, steh' wieder auf
Auch wenn es manchmal humpelt, nimmt das Leben seinen Lauf
Auch wenn es manchmal weh tut, halt' den Kopf noch höher
Beiss' die Zähne zusammen, Bruder, denk' nicht an früher
Sieh' nach vorn, blick nicht zurück
Geh' einen neuen Weg, er führt dich vielleicht zum Glück
Kämpf' für deine Träume, gib' niemals auf
Nach den Tiefen, Bruder, glaub' mir, geht es wieder 'rauf
Und vielleicht noch höher, als du jemals dachtest,
Sammle deine Kraft jetzt, denn es wird nicht gehen, wenn du schwach bist
Mach' das was dein Herz dir sagt
Denk an deine Ziele, Schwester, wenn der Schmerz dich plagt (Denk dran)
Und wenn du nicht geliebt wirst, dann lieb dich selbst
Gott wird immer für dich da sein auf dieser Welt
Und hüte deine Seele, sie geht sonst verloren
Lass' die Liebe in dein Herz, es ist sonst erfroren

Du bist on Top, my man
Du hast einfach, was der Rest nicht hat, my man
Was auch immer du dir vornimmst, es klappt my man

Auch wenn's dir nicht so vorkommt als ob
Viele von uns sind frustriert und gefangen im täglichen Trott
Und die Routine macht uns müde
Du siehst in den Spiegel, merkst wie du älter wirst
Und denkst an deine früheren Ziele, mach' dich nicht irre
Vielleicht verlierst du manchmal 'nen Kampf
Doch verlieren wir den Mut und Hoffnung, dann verlieren wir ganz
Lass' nicht zu das Negatives dich einnimmt und deinen Kopf verdreht
Denn Übel bringt Übel mit sich, des hat man schon oft gesehen.
Versuch' nicht nur auszuhalten, sondern etwas zu ändern
Die Zukunft ist das, was wir daraus formen mit unseren Händen
Verzweifel' nicht, auch für dich ist ein Weg in Sicht
Es geht immer voran, zöger' nicht, mach' dich auf, fang morgen schon an
Denn Sorgen und Angst lähmen uns und nehmen uns den Elan
Wir sind alle Strahlen der Sonne, keiner ist hier egal
Sei dir bewusst, was du leisten du in der Lage bist,
Gib' all deine Kraft
Bleib dran und mach's und du schaffst es wirklich denn

Du bist on Top, my man

Mich kann man nicht reduzieren auf die Klamotten, die ich trage oder Wagen die ich fahre
Solange ich noch in der Lage bin zu tun, was ich seit über 10 Jahren unaufhörlich mache
Was ist des? Diese Rapper begraben, des is Fakt
Sie sind verängstigt, denken, ich hät't einen Pakt mit dem Teufel
Doch ich würde mich nie mit dem Bösen versöhnen (Ah ah)

Mhhh, ehrlich gesagt, nein. dieses Becken ist schon brechend voll
Und ihr habt dem Ding hier eh nichts produktives beizufügen
Was für Beine, meine Zeilen machen diesen Schweinen Flügel
Keine Lüge, ich entscheide über siegen oder scheitern
Jede Line trifft um ein Vielfaches präziser als ein Sniper

Ich kill' sie im Alleingang, durch mich wird das Unbegreifliche begreifbar
Bringt, wenn ihr wollt, diesen Flow können nicht mal euer Meister meistern
Sie hören mich und sind versteinert, gefroren wie aus dem Eisfach
Ihre Sinne spielen verrückt, sie sehen mich Dreifach
Des Orakel, mich zu fronten ist politisch unkorrekter als Haifang
Du kommst nicht weiter, neben mir bleibst du für immer 3sat
Der ewige Zweite, ein lebenslanger Gefreiter

Hochgradigst animalisch, Fans schreien wie fanatisch
O, P, T, I, K, keiner kommt mehr an uns ran
Die Anderen, man, sind allesamt nur amüsant

Zeilen die Bilder schaffen, wie aus Leni Riefenstahls Hand

Nicht nur du, dein gesamtes Team wird misshandelt

Deswegen drehn sie durch, fahren drauf ab wie Bienen auf Pflanzen

Ich mein es ist offensichtlich, ihr fragt warum des was ich schreibe so geil ist
Und hofft im Insgeheimen, meine Karriere wäre beendet
Doch es geht nicht denn ich bin einfach die Eins ob tot oder lebendig

Auch wenn meine Zeit auf dieser Erde begrenzt ist
Durch meine Taten bleibt mein Name für die Unendlichkeit
Jeder kennt mich und weiß ich bin 'ne Legende

Denn mich zu batteln ist wie allem ernstes mit 'nem Grizzly ringen
Hol geh, hol deine Homies ich hol sie runter von ihrem hohen
Ross wieder auf den Boden, lass die Schoten
Ich weiß, ihr wollt dass ich einfacher Rap
Zum Beispiel langsamer, Handzahmer, uhuh
Das ist eher was für die Fitnessfraktion
Komm zu meiner Crew sieh wie ich spitt-in-Aktion
Keiner kann mir das Wasser reichen bis auf 'nen Barkeeper
Was für Konkurrenz ich bin ein komplett anderes Ka-liber
Ihr könnt mich ständig nochmal kopier'n, wie 'ne Wahlwiederholung
Das bringt euch einfach nicht weiter, ich spitt a-giler

Ich will diese ganze Welt zerstören, U.S.A.

Ich geb' euch ein bisschen mehr Zeit zum Lernen
Bis ihr alle schreit, des ist Optik
Ich geb's zu, kommt mit uns, folgt dieser Kampagne
Wir machen Party als gäb' es jeden Abend Champagner
Groß, klein, fett, dünn, Jungs oder Mädels, des ist egal
Ihr braucht nur uns wie Premiere
Denn wir liefern euch volles Programm, was die anderen labern
Kann man ihn leider nicht abkaufen wie olles Brot
Setzt mal eure Sonnenbrillen ab, seht die Dinge klar
Plötzlich wird die Szene depressiv, denn der King is' da
Wirklich ihr erstickt in euren xxs Shirts
Du bis nich' ein Rapper, weil du 'nen bisschen Rap hörst
Wenn der Rest dich stört und dazu übel deinen Kopf fickt
Schreit's mit uns Optik, Optik, Optik

Hände hoch, schreit's mit, alle schieben Optik
Alle schieben Optik, alle schieben Optik

Los, hebt die Hände hoch und lasst sie oben
Bis unsere Eltern denken 
""Was sind das denn für Idioten?""
Aber das ist keine Phase, das ist unser Lifestyle, unser Leben
Wie wir uns kleiden, geben und reden, des is' Optik
Gleich wie wenig oder wie viel man hat
Wir schieben mehr Optik als in 'nem Fielmann Shop
Schaut mal unser Team an, eure National-elf
Diese Mucke is' wie beide Hände voller Bargeld
Jackpot S.A.V. euer Rap-Gott
Früher broke, heut' mach' ich Kohle wie Mark Medlock
Mein Flow is' Domestos und ich klinge so berauschend
Jeder Ort, an dem ich gerade bin, wird zum Trackspot
Oder auch zum Headshot wie auch immer
Hauptsache wir dreh'n übertrieben durch wie Sonic der Hedgehog
Ganz gleich, ob allein oder vereint
Schreit's der Welt entgegen or four life

Sie kommen nich' weiter und sind es so Leid
Ihr dachtet wirklich diese Pisse wär' leicht, wie? Weit gefehlt
Doch bringt jeden Rapper, den ihr wollt, einer geht noch
Wir heizen ihm ein, als ob man tausend Tees kocht
Und machen dem Gesocks dampfende D-Loks
Jede Zeile is' Epos und ich spitte weiter bis mein Kehlkopf reißt
Oder ich im Strand in St. Tropez hock'
New Shorts, Shirts und geht doch, stop!
Is ok, Schmock, gib dir paar B-Lock
Zock und komm mal runter bitte

Kool Savas,"Ich kann nicht noch mal reseten, mein Leben zurückdrehen
Wie der Prince of Persia und mich fragen
Will ich einen Job als Rapper?
Paar sind gescheitert, nicht paar, 
Viele diese Player waren nicht in der Lage dieses Spiel zu spielen
Deswegen blick ich auf sie runter wie im alten GTA
Schieße auf sie wie in Doom, hoff', dass ich sie nie wieder seh'
Auf diesen Wegen gibt es mehr Gegner als im Survival Mode
Ich stecke sie weg mit diesen Rhymes und Flows
Und spitte so perfekt, par excellence
Das ist mein Wurf vor dem Schluss, die letzte Chance
D'rum geb ich Stoff wie in 'nem Kart mit drei Pilzen
In diesem Spiel hier bildet man sich manchmal die Freunde ein wie in Wilson
Mein Flow lässt dich schmelzen und verbrennt die Schmocks
Ich werd' zum Irren und spring auf sie wie der Bandicot
Ihr gebt Gas, bremst und hockt mir am Hintern, doch kommt leider nicht vorbei
Denn ich bin auf 'nem anderen Level, ihr Schweine

Sie sagen Rap wär' nur ein Spiel, das ist alles nur ein Game, gut
Ich spiele gerne mit und setze mein Leben
Diese Runde entscheidet und ich hab lange gewartet
Jetzt heißt es, alles oder nichts
Ich kann nicht nochmal starten
Sie sagen Rap wär' nur ein Spiel, das ist alles nur ein Game, gut

Ich will die große Kohle nicht, eure Monopoly Scheine
Spit' eine Todeszeile, sie fallen um wie Dominosteine
Zieht bloß wieder Leine und folgt eurer Mission wie Lara Croft
Ihr labert oft, doch habt nichts zu sagen, ihr Versager
Ich meine, Verlierer, ihr spielt in den Texten die Gangster
Schiebt euch den Film als wärt ihr gerade in 'nem Action-Adventure
Was auch kommt, ich halt die Pads in der Hand und steiger' mich täglich
Am Ende des Weges fügt alles sich zusammen wie Tetris
Wir spielen dieses Spiel hier mit, übernehmen es wie Cortax
Optik Army, paar Jungs und ein Mädchen wie Mario Brothers
Ihr macht auf Street Fighter doch kommt nie weiter, nicht viel weiter als bis hier
Ich nehm' euch Call of Duty mäßig ins Visier und
Snipe euch wie Moorhühner, diese Art von Schüssen hält nicht mal dein bester Torhüter
Ihr gebt euch geschlagen, bevor das Battle begonnen hat
Für jeder meiner Taten verdien' ich die Medal of Honor

Sie sagen Rap wär' nur ein Spiel, das ist alles nur ein Game, gut

Lass mich ans Micro und ich ess'
Easy diese Freeks inklusive ihrer Labelkollegen und Disstracks
Ihr wart am Start, aber was ist jetzt?
Gar nichts mehr ich dagegen geh unauffällig weiter und ihr wisst S
Mein Hunger ist all-gegenwärtig, Sie hören mich und rufen ""Halt""
Heute noch nicht bald, vielleicht in ein paar Jahren (Ha!)
Wenn Ihr das glaubt seid ihr dümmer als ich gedacht hab
Sagt mal nichts mein Leben war´n auf und ab wie in 'ner Achterbahn, Ich
Hol was mir zusteht, Ihr könnt dabei zuseh'n
Zu spät, seht wie Türen zugeh'n
Ihr wollt's nicht zugeben doch denkt es, ich weiß es
Ich mein es ist offensichtlich, ihr fragt warum des was ich schreibe so geil ist
Und hofft im Insgeheimen, meine Karriere wäre beendet
Doch es geht nicht denn ich bin einfach die Eins ob tot oder lebendig

Auch wenn meine Zeit auf dieser Erde begrenzt ist
Durch meine Taten bleibt mein Name für die Unendlichkeit
Jeder kennt mich und weiß ich bin 'ne Legende

Ich kann reinen Herzens behaupten das ihr 'n bisschen spinnt
Denn mich zu batteln ist wie allem ernstes mit 'nem Grizzly ringen
Hol geh, hol deine Homies ich hol sie runter von ihrem hohen
Ross wieder auf den Boden, lass die Schoten
Ich weiß, ihr wollt dass ich einfacher Rap
Zum Beispiel langsamer, Handzahmer, uhuh
Das ist eher was für die Fitnessfraktion
Komm zu meiner Crew sieh wie ich spitt-in-Aktion
Keiner kann mir das Wasser reichen bis auf 'nen Barkeeper
Was für Konkurrenz ich bin ein komplett anderes Ka-liber
Ihr könnt mich ständig nochmal kopier'n, wie 'ne Wahlwiederholung
Das bringt euch einfach nicht weiter, ich spitt a-giler
Annormaler, Asozialer, Abartiger (achso)
Mein Flow schlägt dir auf den Magen wie Milch bei 'ner Laktose -Allergie
Alle die zweifelten sind wie umgekrempelt

Kool Savas,"Du siehst sie auf der FHM, Matador, Praline und Max,
Im Bikini oder Slip manche von ihnen sind nackt,
Sie schauen dich an, und plötzlich wird die peitsche hart
Du legst sie hin und verpasst ihnen einen weißen Bart
Das ist kein Ding, männer machen dis ganz normal
Bisschen Creme an die Hand, und dann ab an den Aal,
Mädels, von unten sieht das aus wie ein Puppentanz
Und wir machen weiter bis dis Lama nicht spucken kann
Wenn dein Freund meint er will nicht mehr bocken für heute, (Hmm?)
Hat er sich vielleicht beim Keulen seinen Knochen gehäutet,
In meiner Schule waren einige gute Bräute und chicks,
Nichts Mathe, ich lernte wie man schleudert und wichst.
Dis ist einfacher als ausgehen, essen und reden
Du kannst aufs Klo gehen und dir nebenbei einen kneten.

Stell dir irgendeine Schlampe vor, phantasier
Und sie ist augenblicklich nackt vor dir,
Und sag gib mir dein
Uh ah ah Uh Uh ah sie will den
Uh ah ah Uh Uh ah sie will den
Uh ah ah Uh Uh ah sie will den
Uh ah ah Uh Uh

Du Triffst sie in der Bahn in der Bar oder allein in der Stadt,
Geschminkt wie eine Hure die dir gern zeigt was sie hat,
Du willst ran, aber sie macht auf schüchterndes Flittchen,
Merk dir ihr face du kannst dir später lüstern ein wichsen,
Du kochst dir dein eigenes Süppchen,
Bist zu hause und hast nichts zu tun,
Mach dich locker und würg dein Huhn
Und bist du ohne Kohle und dazu ein Hässlicher Vogel,
Könnte es sein ihr bleibt immer alleine, du und dein Hobel,
Du holst dir Quelle Kataloge, nicht wegen der Mode,
Schepperst dir einen als wolltest du ins Guinness Buch der Rekorde,
Auch wenn ollen tun als wäre ihre Grotte aus Gold,
Mach dir keinen Ärger, geh dir selber flott an den Dolch.
Nimm dein Glück in die eigene Hand
Schüttel' die Nudel und das Ergebnis kommt wie am Stück aus der Tube.

Kool Savas,"Haltet euch nicht mehr fest,
Lasst uns, kommt mit mir, denn ich schwemm' euch fort an jeden Ort
An den ich will und reiß euch mit mir Wort für Wort.
Buchstabe für Buchstabe,
Mein Flow ist buchstäblich wie Tsunamis die auf euch zu rasen,
Zuschlagen bis ihr in Blutlachen badet,
Drin untergeht und eure Lungen versagen zu atmen.
Manches ist euch zu arg und zu brutal
Oder euren (?) zu arm und zu lang wie Zugfahrten.
Voll am A, wer zweifelt jetzt noch? Du? warte, du Made,
Ich schick dich zurück in deinen Buchladen,
Schließ' dich in ne Schublade. Wie kommst du jetzt noch raus da ha?
Red' nicht über mich! Pass lieber auf deine perle auf wie ne Auster!
Und ich kann nicht mal respektlos sein denn ich hab kein Respekt vor dir.
Dein bester Song kommt nicht mal an den wacksten Track von mir ran!
Du brauchst Werbung und musst künstlich jetzt diesen Dreck forcieren,
Machst Politik und lässt dich wie der Kanzler eskortieren.
Ehrloses Stückchen Etwas, bist innen(?) süß wie Nektar.
Ihr wollt die Wahrheit? Schließ' mich an einen Lügendetektor.
Du kleiner Junge, du Punk, du (??) bist nicht gemacht für diesen Beef,
Das laugt dich aus wie ein Gang durch die Wüste.
Ich hab das Ding hier in trockenen Tüchern,
Und ihr müsst euch mir fügen, denn ich trete übers Ufer in Schüben.
Lass es gießen wie aus Kübeln, geb' euch Typen übel,
Überschwemm' eure Strände, mach dem Hokus Pokus ein Ende.
Ihr hört es komm, es macht


Und ich reiß alles mit: Häuser, Bäume..verwüste das ganze Land,
Steig aus dem Himmel wie Christus und lass euch büßen ihr Punks.
Ihr reulosen Ficker wollt nicht alles gut glauben
Und geht mit aufgerissenen Augen unter in diesen Fluten.
Das ist mehr als Hip Hop, ich bring euch den Zorn Gottes
Und hol mir jeden einzelnen von euch bis ihr (?)
Hit diesen Melbeat in Bestzeit, ich greif dich Motherfucker an wie 'n Haifisch,
Beiß dich tot, zerreiß dich, fress' dich auf und scheiß dich aus du Pfeife.
Und komm mir nicht in die Quere,
Denn ich komm und zieh euch in die Tiefen des Meeres,
Wo nichts herrscht bis auf gähnende Leere.
Zieh mich zurück und warte, lass dich nochmal atmen,
Zerstör dein Hab und Gut, lass dich in Trümmern baden.
Flieh in die Berge wenn du meinst es ist zu früh zum sterben,
Mir ist es gleich,denn jeder geht drauf ob alt, ob jung,
In diesem Moment ist jeder mein Feind!
Denn dieser Flow kennt kein Erbarmen,
Nehm deine Liebste zum letzte mal in die Arme
Und bete noch einmal, amen! Jetzt ist es so weit",Welle [*]

Niemand kann mehr eure Platten hören, Lyrics glauben.
Ich rap irgendwas, irgendwie und vertick hunderttausend.
Seh' den Blick in euern Augen er hat nichts zu sagen,
Sätze nur aus Phrasen und sein Album ist bis jetzt nicht draußen.
Ihr könnt reden, doch ich brauch nicht mal mehr zu rappen,
denn die Leute kennen jeden meiner Texte bis ins letzte.
Ich bin nicht der beste, doch kenn' auch keinen besseren als mich
und präsentier' Rhymes, wie Bitches Ärsche in der Disco.
Ihr müsst haten und mich motivieren, noch mehr zu schreiben,
denn ich muss schreiben und euch motivieren noch mehr zu bieten.

Bitches kommen und fronten und gehen wieder klein gehackt.
Ihr habt nix zu tun als Reimer-Satz und hated jeden,
statt ein bisschen Props zu geben oder ganz normal zu reden.
Da euch Texte fehlen, müsst ihr euer Ego boosten
und rappen, weil ihr wirklich glaubt, ihr seid dazu berufen.
Ich flow besser, wenn ich huste, reime besser ohne Zunge
Und hab doppelt soviel Luft wie ihr am Mikro ohne Lunge.
Ich verschicke Wörter klar und deutlich mit dem Mörser
und komm somit in die tief bis in die letzten Ecken in den Dörfern.
Ich bin nett zu jedem Pförtner, aber nicht zu kleinen Bitches,

Wichtig ist, du vergiss nicht, da wo ein Wille ist fällt jedes Hindernis

Du bist jung und alles ist in Hektik um dich herum
Und dein Kopf ist gefickt, doch du bist im Grunde frei und gesund
Und kannst entscheiden wohin es geht, was du gerne mal wärst
Auch wenn das Ziel dir noch fern erscheint, der Versuch ist es wert
Guck was du lernst, was du erlebst und später von hast
So lang du nicht auf die anderen kackst oder handelst aus Hass
Ein Leben ist das größte Geschenk, was Gott einem gibt
Zum Beispiel lieben dich deine Eltern, wie du sie auch liebst
Mach dir keine Sorgen, dass niemand da ist, wenn du ihn brauchst
Denn deine Geschwister, Verwandten und Freunde helfen dir auch
Halt immer daran, gib einfach deinen liebsten die Hand
Denn jeder Moment, den ihr verbringt hält für ein Leben lang an
Nix ist so wichtig, wie jede die immer an deiner Seite sind
Ob du reich und dick erfolgreich oder fertig und pleite bist
Der Sinn des Leben ist, deinem Leben einen Sinn zu geben
Statt, klauen und betrügen, Wehrlose schlagen und lügen
Entfern dich von all dem negativen Dreck, der dich bumst
Und sei lieber down mit ein paar richtigen Freunden, anstatt tausend Kumpels
Du kannst, nicht immer cool sein und sauber bleiben am Stück
Doch es versuchen, denn irgendwann kommt alles wieder zurück

Wenn dein Herz keine Spur von Hoffnung mehr hat
Und keiner dich für das, was du tust schätzt
Jeder Tag dem anderen eins zu eins gleicht
Brauchst du noch nicht aufzugeben
Denn vielleicht ist heut' der beste Tag deines Lebens

Lass den Kopf nicht hängen und bleib so, wie du bist
Statt drauf zu achten, was irgendein Fremder meint
So lange du weißt, dass du keinem extra im Weg bist und schadest
Mach was du willst und hol immer das beste aus jedem Tag
Probier' zu sehen, was der andere mag und tu etwas gutes
Und etwas gutes kommt zu dir, grad wenn dus nicht vermutest
Sieh wenn du merkst, das dir irgendwas fehlt und dich etwas quält
Versuch einfach aus dir zu gehen und dich selbst von außen zu sehen
Du könntest ohne Probleme aufhören Tiere zu essen
Und somit ohne Probleme ein paar mehr Leben retten
Du solltest einfach mehr Zeit mit deinen Eltern verbringen
Und somit einfach helfen, deine Familie noch mehr zu binden
Glaub nicht jeder ist gegen dich und ein Hindernis
Sei nett und bescheiden, korrekt und fleißig und du kannst alles erreichen
Hör auf zu zweifeln, denn gestern ist Vergangenheit
Und morgen ein Rätsel, doch heut' vielleicht noch der beste Tag deines Lebens

Wenn dein Herz keine Spur von Hoffnung mehr hat
Und keiner dich für das, was du tust schätzt
Jeder Tag dem anderen eins zu eins gleicht
Brauchst du noch nicht aufzugeben
Denn vielleicht ist heut' der beste Tag deines Lebens

Nicht jeder Tag in meinem Leben war der beste
Doch jeden Schmerz, jede Hürde, weiß ich zu schätzen
Denn eines Tages ist da Licht für jedermann
Auch für mich war's nicht einfach
Das Leben nahm mich richtig ran
Doch wäre ich unten nicht gewesen
Wäre ich heute nicht wer ich bin
Wenn du versuchst, zu verstehen
Egal was kommt, nach vorne gehen
Könnte bald der beste Tag deines Lebens sein

Wenn dein Herz keine Spur von Hoffnung mehr hat
Und keiner dich für das, was du tust schätzt
Jeder Tag dem anderen eins zu eins gleicht
Brauchst du noch nicht aufzugeben
Denn vielleicht ist heut' der beste Tag deines Lebens
Wenn dein Herz keine Spur von Hoffnung mehr hat
Und keiner dich für das, was du tust schätzt
Jeder Tag dem anderen eins zu eins gleicht
Brauchst du noch nicht aufzugeben
Denn vielleicht ist heut' der beste Tag deines Lebens",Der Beste Tag Meines Lebens

solang du nicht die Augen öffnest und die Dinge erkennst

[Kool Savas]: Verse IV
My man, guck, du behauptest deine Freunde sein Gangsta, my man
Guck, neben dir is sogar Freundeskreis gangsta, my man
Guck, ich kann nichts dafür, dass jeder mich hört, my man
Guck, du blamierst dich wie ein zu enges Shirt, my man
Guck, mich interessiert keine Meinung und Kommentare, my man
Guck, du willst reden? Komm, wir reden über bares, my man

[Kool Savas]: Chorus
Guck, my Man
Guck, dieser Shit macht - Druck und Lärm
Tut alles, ihr euch uns nicht nähern
Denn wir sind einfach zu weit weg
von euch zu weit entfernt

Guck, my Man
Guck, dieser Shit macht - Druck und Lärm
Tut alles, ihr euch uns nicht nähern

Kool Savas,"Ihr Fools losed!
Wie, du willst mich jetzt von meinem Thron verdrängen? Tu es, Dude!
Ich komm' wie die Trenchcoat Mafia zu dir Punk und shoot, shoot
Burn dich komplett bis man deine Knochen in der Glut sucht
Das hier geht pop pop pop pop
Ich bin kein Gangster, kein Gee
Ich bang bang auf'n Beat
Ich bin back, bring back, realen Rap, reale Musik
Ich bin hungrig wie Herz & Mauzi am Morgen, spit und ermorde
Crews, fick und besorg es deinem Chicken von vorne
Glaub mir my man, ich heb' die Faust in die Luft wie Mandela und ""Fight the Power!""
Warum? Denn mich macht eure Scheiße sauer
Ich schieb' meistens Trauer
Spit und zerreiß dich, Bauer
Nix fat Pockets, ich will Kohle höher stapeln als der Eiffel-Tower
Auch wenn es 40 Jahre dauert wie die Mauer, fuck it!
Mein Leben kommt mir kürzer vor wie die Beine vom Dackel
Ich fick euch peinliches Pack
Euch ist meine Scheiße zu hot
Ich hab's geschafft ohne zu faken, schneid dir 'ne Scheibe von ab

Alter, dreh den Shit auf, komm, beweg deinen Arsch
Und lass mich eins klären, wir sind eins hier
Deutschland hatte kein Dreamteam, jetzt ist EINS hier
Ich bring die Straße in den Club, Junge, guck!
Dies ist Ghetto R'n'B und ich bin kein Spaß, wenn ich spuck
Hör mir zu, ich sag'es noch ein mal, du Fotze krepierst
Und spuckst zu dem Beat und fick dein Arsch, der Bozz ist jetzt hier
Optik Boom, kommt mit *Boom*

Kool Savas,"Ey what's up. Here's the kid 50 Cent.
You are now tuned in to my man Kool Savas.
Optik Boom. Destroy the German Dream, ya heard? G-Unit

Du hast es geschafft, Eko, die Leute reden wieder von dir
Nachdem sie dachten du wärst weg, auf und davon und krepiert
Shit, das ist zu emotional ich bin ganz ruhig rational
Ich geh back zu dem Anfang und sag es dir noch einmal
Erinner dich Ekrem du ludst mich ein zu ´ner Jam
Mein größtmöglicher Fan, mein persönlicher Stan
Du warst noch Ekrem Bora, sexy Kanake, nicht Eko Freezy
Der stotternde Junge, der Schuhverkäufer aus Gleezy, egal
ich nahm dich mit nach Berlin und Mel gab dir die richtigen Beats
Plötzlich warst du ein richtiger Rapper mit richtiger EP
Nahm dich auf Gigs, gab dir dies, gab dir das
Gab dir Kies, gab dir was du brauchtest dachte dieser Junge wird MC
Verließ Put da Needle sprach mit East, West und Universal
Keiner wollte dich, ich verzichtete auf 170 E´s
Ich hab es dir versprochen, ich hab´n Deal du hast´n Deal
Einen Monat später hast du deinen Deal bei BMG
50.000 Euro du hältst es für selbstverständlich
Warst ein guter Mensch und fängst an dich durch das Cash zu verändern
Wolltest alles haben, raus, rauf, so schnell wie möglich
Denn du warst dumm jung brauchtest soviel Geld wie möglich
Wolltest ein Song mit Trooper einen mit Jeanette und mit Vanessa S
Ich musste dich überzeugen das du es besser lässt Valezka meinte nur
Langsam ist Ekrem abgespaced
Verrückt eine Woche später hör ich das sie mit Ekrem schläft
Mit ihm ein Album macht kurz bevor das Album mit Mel zu Ende ist
Nachdem sie bei uns wohnt die ganze zeit aus unseren Händen frisst
Und will das man ihr alles bezahlt
Jetzt ist alles egal, ihr seid broke, aber ich hart, jetzt ist alles im Arsch
Ihr setzt Erfolg über Realness, setzt Cash über Freunde
Eko nimmt Texte von Killa Cam übersetzt sie ins Deutsche
Ich hab dich geliebt doch nicht wie ein Schwuler einen anderen Mann
Wie ein Bruder der für seinen Bruder tut was er kann
Aber du bist nicht loyal, nicht normal, du bist der Fan, nicht Amar
Ich hab leider einmal ein Auge zugedrückt, nicht noch mal
Eko du und ich waren auf einer Stufe immer gleichberechtigt
Aber du machst deine Karierre-Moves immer gleich berechnend
Wolltest Scheiße schwätzen und sinnlos reden, Mel Infos geben
Weil du dachtest so zerstörst du mein Leben
Wolltest nicht mehr raus, aus Angst das Bushido vor dem Haus wartet
Ich musst mit ihm reden, das regeln bevor es ausartet
Er und ich wir hatten keinen Beef, haben uns nicht gehasst
Nur wegen dir ist unsere Beziehung jetzt ein bisschen vorbelastet
Ek ich muss nicht biten wie du, weil bei mir alles flowed
Du bist ein Typ der Lügen verbreitet wie Hannes Loh, du merkst
Es geht langsam runter wird langsam dunkler
Und schnell schnell, back zu dem Untergrund in den Bunker, Shit
Alles was du machst ist reine Strategie und Planung doch hier
Rappen grad über 10 lange Jahre Erfahrung
Ich war wie ein Vater für dich als wärst du aus meinem Samen und
Du willst jetzt gegen mich rebellieren aber warum?
Sohn, nicht so sorry du bist tot
Auch dieses Battle holt dich nicht hoch
Und du hast recht, ich bin fast 30 Jahr'
Aber wo ist jetzt der Diss? Ich peil's nicht mal
Wo wärst du heute ohne Optik? Denk fleißig nach
Jetzt wird der German Dream zum Albtraum, scheiße wa?
Komm zu mir, ich kläre deine Sicht mit ´ner heißen Nadel
Noch ein paar Bars und du liegst still und leise da
Jetzt hat der kleine ´nen Bart ,denkt er wäre eisenhart
Du und Valeska passt zusammen euch fehlt live der Atem
Und Eko hörst du das? Wie ich dich Zeile für Zeile wegbombe
Deine Augenbrauen werden zum „M“ von McDonalds
Lil` Eko dieser Beef macht keinen Sinn
Das ist der King gegen ein Kind, der Track ist wie ein Ding gegen dein Kinn
Das Urteil wird dein Untergang, aus und fin
Ich bin am flowen wie der Wind, lass es raus wie ein Pint
Ich bin kein Hater du kennst mich,
Doch du bist faker als Sentence S
Ist wie die Sonne für dich, komm näher und du verbrennst dich
Diese Flut überlebst du nicht, kuck an mir überhebst du dich
Meinen Flow übertriffst du nicht, nach dem Part übergibst du dich
Was du machst ist nicht korrekt wie Behindertenwitze
Alles was du schreibst ist für mich nicht mehr als Kindergekritzel
Hör was du in Interviews sagst
Leute hassen dich nicht
Weil sie mich lieben sondern für deine Art Eko
Nicht nur weil du scheiße bist sondern so unbescheiden bist
Player Lover Türkenrap oder Gangster entscheide dich
Du weißt es nicht, denn du hast keine Identität
Als wären die Augen geschlossen du weißt nicht wo du grad stehst
Und weißt nicht was du grad redest das Game macht dich krank ne?
Komm ich knips dich aus wie ´ne Nachttischlampe
Und du meinst du hast unsre Jungs zu Optik geholt
Warum hat dein Label dann nicht einen Act auf Optik-Niveau?
Mein Freund du träumst, verrückt vom Schnee, crazy von E´s
Das ist ein Phänomen, was geht vor im Schädel von E?
Du bist des Todes, deine Mutter meinte „Tu meinem Sohn nix“
Ich wollt nicht, doch der Bengel ist zu verzogen mir zu verlogen
Was? Ich hab unsere Zukunft gefickt? Es gibt keine Zukunft für dich
Zumindest nicht als Rapper in diesem Biz
Und das ist alles wahr, ihr könnt mich auch gern vereidigen
Dieser Part hier sind die Fakten aber der nächste wird sehr beleidigend
Nein! Ich muss mich nicht verteidigen,
Ich tu das für die Kids da draußen
Die warten und wissen wollen was Sache ist
Hier ist euer Report
Zeigt mich an denn dieser Track ist wie Mord
Ihr hört den Besten, den King, den rappenden Tony Hawk
Du willst von hinten an den Thron ran aber nein Heuchler
Ich spit und verbreite mehr Panik als Robert Steinhäuser
Und du bist geil auf mein Titel wie Jungs auf das Loch von J.Lo
Machst auf ein mal auf Mann und hast plötzlich mehr Beef als Maredo
Doch ich hab dich gemacht wie Puffy „Da Band“
Und wenn du willst, lös ich dich wieder auf „Click Click Bang“
Aber bitte sag mir eins, Eko was ist bloß mit dir los?
Du bist nicht Mr.Hankey, sag wie kommst du bloß aus´m Klo?
Du warst weg, weit weg in der Popwelt
Der Rapper der Dieter Bohlen den Cock hält. Bald gibt es Kopfgeld
Du bist verrückt, du willst zurück, wer bist du nur?
Warst L.O.V.E und jetzt wieder HipHop du Missgeburt
Du bist einer von ihnen Nina MC, Reen, Cappuccino
Alexey, der Wolf, Eko und Fettes Brot sind alle tot
Rest in Peace! Dies ist eine neue Ära und
Ich bin euer Lehrer, und feuer wie Gewehre und
Du bist sanfter als sanft sanfter als samt
Fuck mich ab und ich mach dir Dampf, zerstör dich voll und ganz Ek
Lutsch meinen Schwanz!",Das Urteil
Kool Savas,"Guck, ich will kein Star sein
Ich muss - nicht mal am Start sein
Ich will nur meinen Liebsten nah sein
Führ mein Dasein gerad', wie auf'm Drahtseil
Führ mein Leben tagein, tagaus für die Arbeit
Und ich steh' jetzt hier mit ihr
Am Handy und sie sagt, dass sie mich nicht sehen will und nicht respektiert
Und ich merk, dass es ernst ist, merk, dass sie mich hasst
Und denkt ""Hoffentlich nicht"", und wenn es doch so ist
Will ich, dass du weißt, was auch immer kommt, meine Tür ist immer offen für dich, Mel!
Und die Leute sind nicht normal
Denken ich mach'n Dicken, weil ich im Auto anroll
Hasst nicht mich, hasst die Kids. Ich frag sie nicht, ob sie 'n Autogramm wollen
Zwing sie nicht nur meine Mucke zu hören und meine Shirts zu tragen, zu meinen Gigs zu kommen, meine Platten zu kaufen
Was ist das für 'ne Kacke, ich soll Platten verkaufen und dennoch nichts bekommen, was?!
Und du meinst, du weißt nicht, ob ""Bester Tag"" ehrlich gemeint ist
Denkst du ich schreib das nur um in die Glotze zu kommen? Nein ich find's eher sogar peinlich
Bin nicht stolz, wenn man mich erkennt. Jeder Pisser meint wirklich zu wissen, was man denkt
Geht und redet über Dinge, die er nicht weiß, nicht peilt, nicht begreift
Ihr kennt mich nicht, tut mir Leid
Guck ich schreib diesen Shit bis ihr Wichser weint, bis nichts mehr bleibt
Nichts mehr geht. Mit mehr Feeling als R. Kelly
Mit Azad zusammen auf diesem Beat von Martelli. Was?!

Baby, was sind das für Schmerzen, (was sind das für Schmerzen)
Die ich nicht kannte, weil du nie weg von mir warst? (Baby)
Und Baby, jetzt muss ich merken: (jetzt muss ich merken)
Die ganze Schande. Was hab ich dir angetan? (Was hab ich dir angetan?)

Ihr wollt mich nicht verstehen
Wenn ich sag ""Ich hab nur dieses Leben
Und ich will keine Krisen sehen
Ich will Oben stehen und, Homie, Kohle sehen""
Ich hab zu große Angst vor Morgen, ich
Seh so verdammt viel Sorgen, ich
Fühl mein' Kopf zerspringen und die Hoffnung schwinden
Weil das Licht mir leider verborgen liegt
Sieh mein Engel, du bist Alles für mich
Ich hol den Thron und die Kohle und das Alles für dich
Will, dass du irgendwann mal fühlst, du bist stolz auf mich
Will, dass du Alles hast im Leben und auf nichts verzichten musst
Gott weiß, ich wollte nie, dass du leiden musst
Jetz' fall' ich auf die Knie vor Verzweifelung
Senk mein' Kopf voller Scham, denn ich weiß es tut dir weh
Wenn du siehst, wieviel wir streiten und
Das ganze Hin und Her, will nur in deiner Nähe sein, doch ich bin so fern
Will dir nur meine Liebe geben, doch es ist so schwer
Will dir doch nur 'n Vater sein, doch es wird mir verwehrt, Engel
Und es macht mich krank, ich dreh durch und es macht mir Angst
Ich seh nur ich steh an der Wand
Und verliere den Verstand, weil ich nicht mehr kann, uh
Es ist kein Licht in Sicht, ich bin am Boden und verstehe den Sinn nicht
Alles dreht sich, mir wird schwindlig
Geh mir ausm Weg, ich will mein Kind, ich
Halt's kaum aus, ich dreh durch, wann hört dieser Alptraum auf?
Es tut weh, ich kann es nich verstehn
Ich muss dich sehn, oder untergehn, Baby!

Baby, was sind das für Schmerzen, (was sind das für Schmerzen)
Die ich nicht kannte, weil du nie weg von mir warst? (Baby)
Und Baby, jetzt muss ich merken: (jetzt muss ich merken)
Die ganze Schande. Was hab ich dir angetan? (Was hab ich dir angetan?)

Ich hab' kein Salz für meine Tränen (no no)
Sie fließen nicht, weil sie sich schämen (no no)
Du warst das Salz in meinem Leben (oh)
Kannst du mir nicht vergeben? (Kannst du mir nicht vergeben?)

Baby, was sind das für Schmerzen, (was sind das für Schmerzen)
Die ich nicht kannte, weil du nie weg von mir warst? (Baby)
Und Baby, jetzt muss ich merken: (jetzt muss ich merken)

Kool Savas,"My-my-my-my mic check is life or death
For every rhyme I write, it's twenty-five to life
My-my-my-my mic check is life or death
For every rhyme I write

Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Steht die Welt kurz still und ich spür' weder Raum noch Zeit
Denn immer, wenn ich rhyme
Fällt die Last von mir und ich fühl' mich auf einmal frei
Denn dieser Stift hier weist den Weg
Und trägt mich täglich ein Stück näher
Und zwar immer, wenn ich rhy-yme
Immer, wenn ich rhyme

lass ich mich fallen, wie in ein smoothes Sofa
Rap ist für mich mehr als Disco und ein altes 2Pac-Poster
Ihr rappt Scheiße über große Knarren, gutes Koka
Ich dagegen guck 'n Wholecar, verstehste?
Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Kann ich atmen, ohne Rap, ich stell's mir hart vor
Ich schreib' es hin, wenn ich mir Luft mache, wie ein Ventilator
Es reinigt mich von innen und es dient als Sprachrohr
Meine Träume, meine Artform, verstehst du?
Immer, wenn ich rhyme hab ich etwas, woran ich mich festhalte
Ich vergesse die Welt wie 'ne gelöschte Festplatte
Ich schlage Schneisen in die Lichtung für die Morgensonne
Mit den Mic, immer wenn die Sorgen kommen
Immer, wenn ich rhyme, heb' ich für kurze Zeit ab und lass' es raus
Sehe diese blaue Kugel von oben wie'n Astronaut
Leidenschaft, scheiß mal auf das paper, ich hab alles hier
Ein Stift, ein Blatt Papier, verstehste?

Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Steht die Welt kurz still und ich spür' weder Raum noch Zeit
Denn immer, wenn ich rhyme
Fällt die Last von mir und ich fühl' mich auf einmal frei
Denn dieser Stift hier weist den Weg
Und trägt mich täglich ein Stück näher
Und zwar immer, wenn ich rhy-yme
Immer, wenn ich rhyme

schreib' ich mir von der Seele, was auf meinem Herzen liegt
Die Schlinge sitzt zu fest um meine Kehle
Muss den Schmerz besiegen
Hab für manche Krise in meinem Leben einen Vers geschrieben
10 Alben, ich hab immer noch einen Berg von ihnen
(Immer, wenn ich rhyme)
Doch bau' den Berg ab, mit der Hoffnung, die mein Hammer ist
Der Stift wird mein Meißel sein
Und Stein für Stein fällt von meinem Herzen
Und ich fühl' mich bisschen besser danach
Ich blick' nach oben und hoff', morgen wird ein besserer Tag
Immer, wenn ich rhyme ist es wie immer, wenn ich wein'
Gefühle brechen aus, ich finde einen Beat
Der mein Gefühl versteht und sprech' mich aus
In Hypnose text' ich auf'n Blatt Papier, nächtlich auf-
Wacht am 4, mächtig laut, das ist, wie ich ticke, Bruder
(Immer, wenn ich rhyme)
Und wenn ich spitte, blute ich meine Wunde aus, will aus dem
Dunkeln raus und das Schreiben hilft mir unermesslich
Ich will runter, Stress ist für meinen Geist nur Gift
Such' mir 'n Beat und ich greif' zum Stift und flieg'

Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Steht die Welt kurz still und ich spür' weder Raum noch Zeit
Denn immer, wenn ich rhyme
Fällt die Last von mir und ich fühl' mich auf einmal frei
Denn dieser Stift hier weist den Weg
Und trägt mich täglich ein Stück näher
Und zwar immer, wenn ich rhy-yme
Immer, wenn ich rhyme

verschwindet die Umgebung im Nebel
Tauch' ich Worte in Farbe, feuer' sie raus in 'ner Fontäne
Erweck' ich Blätter zum Leben, Stifte zum Sprechen
Ich wär' nix ohne Rap
Und ich weiß, ob ihr wollt oder nicht, ihr merkt es
Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Glänzen ihre Augen, schlägt ihr Herz schneller
Ihr bekommt den besten Flow ever direkt vom Hersteller
Ihnen fehlt der Glanz und deswegen leuchtet mein Stern heller
Food for thought, anstatt 'n leeren Teller kriegt ihr
Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Hört ein and'rer damit auf und lässt es, ich versteh's nicht
Ich brauch' keinen Therapeuten, rap es mir von der Seele
Mein Juwel strahlt lupenrein, wie unter Halogenlicht
Augen zu, du kriegst ihn jedes Mal zu sehen

Und trägt mich täglich ein Stück näher

Jede Zeile bricht die Schweigepflicht
Straight aus dem Bauch entweder schrei ich oder schrei ich nicht
Könntest du mir freiwillig den Wagen geben
Sonst muss ich dich schlagen, treten, das ist mir
Schon immer scheißegal gewesen
Überfahr dich, park deine Scheißkarre in Holland
Könnte einfach so am Zollamt vorbeifahren auf'm Roller
Bring das Weed nach hause, erzähl nix von Weedverkaufen du Fisch
Du kannst viel behaupten, doch du existierst überhaupt nicht für mich

Ist das zu fassen?
Ich will wirklich nicht cholerisch sein
Doch wenn ich spitte wirkt sogar Kinski gegen mich pflegeleicht
Ich knebel deinen Eselarsch
Mach wirbel in Amerika
Asien, Europa, den Mond erober ich nächstes Jahr
Wenn du zu frech wirst vergrab ich dich im Rasen, Ficker
Ja ich bin ein psychopatischer Killer, ein Wahnsinniger
Dein Label dehnt deinen Anus, du kommst dir wie 'n großer Star vor
Du hast jetzt Top10 Hits aber dafür hast du so ein Arschloch
Du bist fake, phony und du lügst in deinem Text
Image kann Realität nicht ersetzen wie Cybersex
Dein Produzent bitet Timbaland seinen Sohn
Ganz ehrlich, so ein Arschloch ist verantwortlich für deine Produktion?
Nich dein Ernst, ihr seid sehr behaarte Hinterwäldler
Und im falschen Beruf wie ein pädophiler Kindergärtner
Du machst auf Zuhälter und sagst du hättest 50 Huren
Suchst aber gleichzeitig deinen Penis mit 'ner Wünschelrute

Ist das zu fassen?
Du lachst wenn du große Schwänze in den Arsch kriegst
Doch du bist so bescheuert, dass du dir nichmal über die Konsequenzen klar bist
Dir fehlt die Basis, der Stil und der Flow
Ich und Rap sind wie Friedmann und Koks
Einfach untrennbar, undenkbar wenn es anders wär, gib das Lenkrad her
Du dumme Sau, du wirfst dein bisschen Grips aus dem Fenster
Nein, nicht der Henker, ich bring dich kurz um wie Kiefer und Co
Tu auf cool, doch du kommst nicht an wie 'n Athlet der den Start schwänzt
Und sag, was fürn Feature? Niemals, nein, leck mich doch am Arsch, Mensch!
Ich behandel dich wie im Zuchthaus
Quäl und verhör dich denn du störst mich
Auf dir warn mehr Gays als auf nem Friseurtisch
Und du bist des Wahnsinns, gehst zum Arzt
Weil du nicht mehr normal bist, tust als würd bei dir was gehn
Das is ungeheuerlich, was der mir erzähl
Ich glaubs nich, überhaupt nichts, von dem was er da bringt ist sinnig
Denkt dieser Punk wirklich dass er ein Pimp is? hmm
Was fürn Kerl, dass er nich merkt
Dass seine Bitch gerade mit mir Party macht

Ich mach live on stage die Action, dass die Atzen 'n Gang raufschalten
Doch Fusi kennt den Text nicht, bitte sag nur er soll's Maul halten
Diese Rapfans sehen mich, fackeln nich lang
Und fragen nach Autogrammen, ich bleibe freundlich und sage: Fass mich nich an!
Halt, ich bin eigentlich ja gegen Gewalt, verstehst du?
Doch red jetzt weiter und ich geh dir an Hals, verstehst du?
Homie, komm stör mich wenn ich schreibe
Fick mein Weib bis ich den Text versaue
Der Moment is gekommen, wo ich dir in die Fresse haue
Nix wie weg hier, diesmal schlag ich dir in die Fresse
Homie vertrau mir, guck ich versprech's dir
Dein Jochbein, dein Genick und dein Rückgrat, ich brech's dir
Ihr Affen, was pimpen, rumposen und knete machen, ihr habt nichts zu tun

Nachdem der Pfarrer fragt, ob noch irgendwer was zu sagen hat
Die Gäste und das Brautpaar schauen verstört zu diesem alten Sack
Und er legt richtig los du bist ja nich normal, du Idiot!
Ähm, entschuldigung, wir heiraten hier gerade ?
Ich hab so Sachen jeden Tag
Denn er meint, Liebe hält nicht ewig und dass das Paar da 'n Fehler macht
Doch die zwei nehm sich in den Armen, küssen sich und sagen dann
Liebe lebenslang, wir glauben dran und dieser Mann sagt:

Kool Savas,"Ich steh im Raum, eng, heiß, Sachen kleben voll Schweiß
Er beißt, brennt in den Augen und darum blinzel ich leicht
Das Licht scheint von der Decke auf das Blatt in der Ecke
Gehalten fest in meiner rechten Hand wie heilige Zettel
Diese Bäume verrecken nich umsonst, ich geb mein Versprechen
Ich werd sie rächen, ihren Tod durch Reden ins Leben übersetzen
Ich setz an zu sprechen, öffne die Augen beim ersten Wort
Und seh Vocalkabine, Studio, Mikros und drück Record

und die Magie nimmt ihren Lauf, der Alchemist mit den Silben
Die Sätze biegen sich wie Kautschuk, beugen sich meinem Willen
Jeder Vergleich ein Flush, jeder Style ein Ass
Jedes Blatt hier haucht mir unendlich Leben ein wie Leonidas
Nimm mir das und du nimmst mir alles
Und ich mein nich Ruhm und das ganze Zeug
Ich hör die Melodie, die Kick mit ihrem Boom und fang an zu träumen
Und seh die Crowd wie sie laut meinen Namen schreit, Arme weit und breit
Das ist alles zu schön um wirklich wahr zu sein also weck mich nich auf

Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist
Auch wenn mein Glück nur ein Traum ist
Lass mich im Glauben daran, aber weck mich nicht auf!
Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist
Auch wenn mein Glück nur ein Traum ist
Lass mich im Glauben daran, aber weck mich nicht auf!

Ich weiß nicht, hab ich das verdient oder habe ich Gott überlistet?
Das Glück war falsch adressiert, ich frag mich ob's wirklich für mich ist
Ich halt es in meiner Hand, manchmal Angst, dass es leicht zerbrechlich ist
Wie lächerlich, ich lach laut wie Verrückte, weils nichts besseres gibt
Ich kipp den Rest aus der Flasche weg, kauf ne neue, ne teurere
Ne neue Runde aus Freude auf meine Freunde
Wir feiern heute zum dreihundertfünfundneunzigsten mal
Die Erfüllung des Kindertraums vom Träumer zum Rapstar
Und Neid ist natürlich da, aber Neid ist Unsicherheit
Von gebrochenen Herzen, denn ihr Traum wurd noch nicht Wirklichkeit
Doch ich wisch es weg wie Beschlag auf dem Spiegel im Bad
Und trag meine Freude trotzdem nach draussen auf dass sie sie inspirieren mag
Was gibt es schöneres als wenn Liebe erwidert wird?
Was gibt es krasseres als wenn das was ich denke Denkmal durch Lieder wird?
Ich bin gesegnet doch seh das oft nicht, ich Pessimist
Darum auch wenn mein Glück nur geträumt ist, dann bitte weck mich nicht!

Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist
Auch wenn mein Glück nur ein Traum ist
Lass mich im Glauben daran, aber weck mich nicht auf!
Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist

Mein treuer Begleiter, ewiger Helfer
Ich hielt an ihm fest, widersetzte mich dem Willen meiner Eltern
Und folgte ihm wie 'nem tonlosen Navi, fand den Weg intuitiv
Den Traum im Hinterkopf während ich nächtelang schrieb
Und ich schlief, um acht als Leiche zur Arbeit, ich sitz am Zeichenbrett
Wehr mich dagegen einzupennen während ich meine Zeilen rap
Und wär es meinem Meister nicht aufgefallen wär vielleicht dieser Track nich'
Wie so viele andere davor, wär das nich ätzend?
Ich denk nich dran was danach ist, stress nich wegen Verkäufen
Denn ich weiß die meisten könnten sich so'n Leben nichtmal erträumen
Kein Rapvokabeltest, ich beherrsch diese Sprache hier fließend
Ich schieß mich nicht ab, bin berauscht von dieser Musik, ich lieb das
Und trotzdem bin ich so rastlos, setz ständig noch einen drauf
Denn ich hab Angst dieser Traum hier könnte enden und ich wach auf
Siehst du die Kids da? Sie wurden groß mit mir und ich wurd groß durch sie
Drum lass mich schlafen in ihren Armen, denn ""It was all a dream!""

Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist
Auch wenn mein Glück nur ein Traum ist

Ich missbrauch' den Stift hier bis er den Geist aufgibt
Denn (Ich will nie mehr gehn')
Es stimmt Märtyrer geraten in Vergessenheit
Merkwürdig, aber ich fühl' mich unsterblich wenn ich Texte schreib'
Merkt ihr das, diese Zeilen hier sind unsichtbar, doch härter als Stein
Sie meinen zwar nichts auf Erden bleibt Ewig doch(Ich will nie mehr gehn')
Klammer mich fest in deinem Herzen wie die erste Liebe
Und ich will in eurem Leben stehn' bevor ich im Sterben liege
Sieh diese Verse sind wie Briefe, die ich hinausschick'
Adressiert an den unendlichen Augenblick (Ich will nie mehr gehn)
Musik ist Medizin gegen Demenz
Und ich fang' das nächste Stück an bevor das davor beendet ist
Zeiten verändern sich, doch die Ideen bleiben beständig
Wechseln ihren Wirt und leben ewig weiter

Ich will nie mehr gehen'
Gib mir ein Mic
Und ich bleib, und ich bleib und ich bleib
Ich will nie mehr
Ich will nie mehr
Ich will nie mehr gehn'

Sätze glänzen vor weißen Wänden wie Eisformen
Jedes einzelne Wort hier schrumpft die Zeit zu 'nem Reiskorn (Halt's fest)
Ich schlafwandel' durch Beats in der Nacht
Spielen den Loop hier ab in 'ner liegenden Acht
(Denn ich will nie mehr gehn) Leb' diesen Moment hier grenzenlos
Ich lass ihn nicht verrinnen (verrückt)
Blut pocht in den Bars hier auch wenn ich nicht mehr bin
Setze mein Brandzeichen markiere diesen Gedanken
Hier in Hoffnung, dass er irgend wen ansteckt Guck (Ich will nie mehr geh'n )
Und jeder Text ist ein weiterer Baustein zu meinem Vermächtnis
Eine Zeile, ich brenn' mich in ihr Gedächtnis
Und bleib' für immer als Anker, beschreib' den Weg eines Vagabunden
Müde vom Rennen gegen den Zeiger (Ich will nie mehr geh'n)
Wir fragen uns was kommt nach uns, Wer bleibt als letzter da?
Aus Sorge, dass niemand später antwortet wolln' wir's jetzt erfahrn'
Nicht im Stande zu akzeptieren, dass alles verblasst
Deswegen Portraitier' ich mich selbst auf nem Blatt hier

Ich will nie mehr gehen'
Gib mir ein Mic
Und ich bleib, und ich bleib und ich bleib
Ich will nie mehr
Ich will nie mehr

(Kill) Gegner mit einem(Ill), ihr wärt mich gerne los
Rammt euch bitte ma' zwei Finger trocken tief in die Kerbe (Yo)
Glaubt mir, ich zerstör' euch von Grund auf, ihr Heuchler
Mit 'nem Flow, der noch seltener is' als Jungfrau'n in Deutschland
Während ihr nur dumm schaut und euch fragt' 
""Was bloß los mit ihm? Was geht', wieso hasst er uns?"" Weil ihr Hunde Rap
Wie Unkraut verseucht habt, Mund auf, ihr Träumer
Alle Rapper in ein' Sack, ich hau' stumpf drauf wie Stoiber

Sieh, ich flow' wie Euphrat
Bring' dein Weltbild ins Wanken wie 'ne Kreuzfahrt
Mach mir die Rhythmik zum Untertan, ein lebender Beat
Meine Abschiedsworte Mittelfinger an jeden MC
Nach mir kommt lange nichts mehr

Der Beweis is' sie liegen mir zu Füßen wie'n Bettvorleger

Denn, dass ich Schwuchteln mit Lines eben fick', is' gebongt wie Kiffer
Nicht von diesem Stern wie die Critters, mit Lyrics für zehn
Ihr könnt mich dritteln und ich kling' noch besser als (Zwei) Drittel
Spitte außergewöhnlich, sieh, mein Flow durchbricht den verfickten Trott
Mach' aus diesen Rappern hier Obstsalat, nenn' es Sizzling Hot

Nix Rapper, du bist nur ein junger Depp wie in Jump Street
Meine Aura nennt sich (Lost-)Magnetfeld, ich bin so anziehend
Ihr bester Flow ist mein Minimum, ich und sie is' wie Gold gegen Nickel
Mach Sitz, riskier keine dicke Lippe wie Ripke
Pierce dir die Nippel, mach irgendwas nuttiges
Ich spitte einma' kurz und putte dich
B*tch, LMS jetzt bis dein Mundinneres wie Pudding is'
Ich könnt' auch deine Frau erwähnen im Text, aber tu's nich'
Du bist ein (Sucker), ich lass' dich Dick kau'n
Als hätt'st du 'n Penis im Essen, lecker nich'?
Fronte wen du willst, doch besser nich' Essah, ich
Hol' dich mit nem preußischen Karabiner, du Kammerdiener
Markier' nicht den Harten, du sagst, das ist nur ein Rhyme
Aber die Vergangenheit zeigt, sowas passiert wie Tomaten
Du steckst im Hintern von, tust auf BFF eines Rappers
Trotzdem geben dir Schlampen kein Gesicht wie Daft Punk
Geh und spring auf den Pimmel von, der is' die nächsten Monate Fame
(Muah, muah) Küsschen, ich warn' dich nur ganz ohne Gehate

Nimm nicht den Mund zu voll, du weißt
Deine Liebste kam bei 'nem Deepthroat um, sie is' tot
Und dennoch wirst du viergeteilt wie 'n Peace-Logo
Ich komm' wieder rein in den Kriegsmodus
Spit heißer als Schmiedöfen mit dem Scheiß, der begeistert wie Friedhöfe
Gib mir das Mic, ich und schick' sie weiter wie Kiezgrößen
Carpe Diem, dein Hype bleibt leider nur für 'ne Zeit wie Mietmöbel
Wofür gebt ihr euch Mühe, ha? Ihr wollt rauskommen? Geht vor die Tür
Das is' mein Warmlaufen, nich' ma' die Kür
Fick nich' mit mir, halt die Füße still
Nach dem Verse bist du Fix und Foxi wie Kinderlektüre
Ich brauch' dich nur mit ei'm Finger berühren, du wirst zum Fels

Ich hatt' die höchste Stimme von all'n
Ich klang mit 14 noch so als wär' ich 9 Jahre alt
So als wär' ich noch'n Kind und die meisten war'n im Stimmbruch
Ich hingegen war auf der Sinnsuche, warum?
Ich knallte Mädels, aber klang wie'n Mädel
Ganz im Ernst, wollt 'ne Stimme wie die ander'n, die dich älter wirken lässt
Die Ollen fanden das süß ich fand's übertrieben nervig
Lehrer schickten mich wegen ihr zu diversen Lesewettbewerben
Sie meinten
""Guck, du sprichst wie ein Engel!""
Ich dachte mir, die wolln' mich alle verarschen, macht das mal selber
Hab' geglaubt, das wär' Blamage, so 'ne Stimme zu haben
Nichtsahnend, was noch alles auf mich wartete, ich bekam
Das erste Album der Beasties und war geschockt wegen Ad-Rock
Dann entdeckte ich Eazy, mein Leben machte 'ne Kehrtwendung
Plötzlich stimmte alles in sich, meine Idole hatten Stimmen wie ich

Denn ich hör meine Stimme das erste Mal aufm' Track gemischt
Mein Englisch war beschissen, doch ich wusste wie man flowt
Wollte klingen wie A-Plus und Opio von den Souls (Damn)
Fing auf Deutsch an, plötzlich stand die Welt Kopf, Labels klopften
Bei mir die Tür mit ihren Geldkoffern
Clubs wollten Bookings, Rapper wollten Features
Auf einmal zahlt mir die früher verhasste Stimme die Miete
Mein Visum zu den Herzen, Ticket in den Walkman
Die Klangfarbe, die sich mit einmal spitten ins Ohr brennt
Eine unter tausend, dieser Segen hier is' Gold wert
Fans kriegen Gänsehaut Live aufm' Konzert
Andere pitchen ihre Stimmen runter, wollen härter kling'
Meine Bestimmung zu akzeptieren war anfangs schwer für mich
Ich dachte, das wär' 'ne Schwäche, die mich bremst
Heute seh' ich diese Stimme als Geschenk

Kool Savas,"Und dann kam Essah!

Ich saß Zuhaus', der Drum-computer auf dem Schoß
Als mein Vater schrie „Mach was für die Schule du Idiot!“
Ich hab sie mies verkackt, sorry Baba doch ich war zu abgelenkt
Allein mit einem Mikrofon in meiner Rap-Gedankenwelt
Ich hing mit MC8 klärte ollen mit Shore
Die Spinner wollten zum Sport-
Platz ich wollt nur auf die Bühne
Die andern saßen im Hof 'rum, ich war texten im Proberaum
S der Gheddophilosoph, Flow blendend wie Koma-saufen
Wenn ich komm ist es aus, sag „Adios“ zu der Karriere
Keine Niederlage, mich bekriegen kostet deine Ehre
Und ich schreib es in mein Fleisch
Hip-Hop is my life
Steh mit 50 auf'm Splash, dreh am Teller wie auf Teiln'
Mach 'n uprock, downrock, bodyrock, mit Scotty und Falk
Ihr Kackvögel steckt den Kopf in den Sand
Auf eure Namen gibt es Finderlohn
Heut' bin ich zwar am Start
Doch leider war es nicht immer so, in dem Land hier gab es

Keine Beats
Keine Rhymes
Keine Texte, die du liebst oder feierst
Keine Durchdreh-Mucke, keine Tracks die dich fesseln
Nichtmal ein' echten Rapper, und dann kam Essah!
Und dann kam Essah!
Und dann kam Essah!

Boby gab mir den Style, Onur die Lifepower
Mel' stärkte mir den Rücken
Steinmauer
Feuer Frei, Der King ist hier
Grund für den Umschwung
Rapper tauchen unter, ich bleib in aller Munde wie Zungen
Und was für Ranglisten?
Guck ihr könnt mich nicht mehr einstufen
Wenn ich bock hab rap' ich ab jetzt rückwärts, Zeitlupe
Vorband Zum Haupptakt, Talent zur Legende
Vom Fan zum Dirigenten, ich bin lang' noch nicht zu Ende
Krieg den Schädel wieder klar,
Plane gut wo du stehst Opfer
Mich zu haten, das ist so wagemutig wie Weight-Watchers
Und ich schlage g'rade mal Drakes Kopf ab
Nur sinnblidlich, sie hör'n das und rufen OMG wie Waynes Tochter
Guck' ich geb Stoff, hab keine Bremsen verbaut
Deswegen start' ich und lass es einfach mal laufen,
Bis die Reifen erschöpft sind
Lyrische Inception, ihr bekommt mich nicht mehr weg
Ich bin verankert in den Köpfen
Vor mir gab's in diesem Land hier

Keine Beats
Keine Rhymes
Keine Texte, die du liebst oder feierst
Keine Durchdreh-Mucke, keine Tracks die dich fesseln
Nichtmal ein' echten Rapper, und dann kam Essah!
Und dann kam Essah!
Und dann kam Essah!

Und ich bleibe für immer
Zieht die Jacken an
Nicht Kachelmann, ich prophezei' n eisigen Winter,
'N scheiß heißen Sommer, blühenden Frühligen, windigen Herbst,
All-Wetter-Rapper, ich bin mehr als nur der Gewinner der Herzen
Nenn' mich „Neuzeitpoet“
Ihr könnt es auch bei Google suchen
Essah jetzt direkt neben Hesse und Brecht dem Hugenduble
Dieser Sound hier, mein Erbe für meine Jungs
Linke Spur im 'nem Turbo
Trotzdem sterb' ich für die Kunst und ich schwör's auf 'ne Belton
Keiner kann dir helfen
Denn ich komm' und unterwerfe deine Stadt wie Krieg der Welten
So als hätt ich den Verstand verlorn',
Sie verspür'n, Hand des Zorns
Ich bin nicht mal in Hammerform
Kein Training das ist angeborn'
Guck jeder dieser Bars fühlt sich an wie im WM-Finale
Ihr solltet statt Che-Guevaras mein Gesicht auf Wände malen
Ich kam in die Szene, zerstückelte jeden
Der Weg ist geebnet nun mach es mir nach
Das E zu dem S zu dem S zu dem A zu dem H
Sieh, vor mir gab's in diesem Land hier

Keine Beats
Keine Rhymes

Formatted lostless acts of lawlessness
In sue when I drop this, instant mosh pit uh
I did it to death from the dingiest depths where the apes at
In a skate straight to the apex
Scraped and scratched, still lamp with a great set
Bivvle wax trapped in a camp with a great set

Kool Savas,"Als du vier Jahre alt warst, besuchte ich euch in Istanbul
Mit deinen Eltern holtest du mich am Flughafen ab
Wir hatten uns zwei Jahre nicht gesehen
An den nächsten Tagen war ich vormittags mit dir allein
Deine Eltern waren zur Arbeit gegangen
Wir wollten spielen
Dazu legtest du dann die Stühle auf den Boden, das war ein Schiff
Wir setzten uns rein und fuhren über den Ozean
Plötzlich riefst du „Achtung, köpekbalığı kommt!“
Dann riefst du „Er hat mich gebissen, Blut kommt raus!“
Allmählich wurde mir klar, köpekbalığı, das sollte ein Haifisch sein
Nun wollte ich auch einige andere Wörter auf Türkisch lernen
Und fragte dich „Was heißt Brot?“
Du sagtest „kuş“
Ich fragte dich „Was heißt Vogel?“
Du sagtest „ekmek“
Und so fragte ich noch einige andere Wörter
Als deine Eltern nach Haus kamen
Und ich voller Stolz sagte, was ich alles gelernt hatte an nur einem Morgen
Gab es Kopfschütteln und Gelächter
Am meisten gelacht hast du, Savas, denn du hattest ja alle Wörter vertauscht",Anekdote aus Istanbul Skit

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Heb' dich hoch, werf' dich lachend in die Sonne

Lasst mal, ihr belastet meine Ohren
Geh' an's Mikro mit 'ner Latte wie am Morgen
Misshandel den Beat wir sind apathisch
Du kriegst 'ne Psychomacke wie Transvestiten
Küss mal deinen Backup, fiste deine Schwester
Scheiß Wichser, ich spitt' sicker als Twista in seinen besten Jahren
Die Spitze, der erste Rang jeder Liste, ihr wisst, euch läuft grad die Frist ab
Denn ich liefer' hier diese Leistung gewissenhaft
Ihr Pussies schiebt Heißhunger, nenn' mich Whiskas, wenn ich flow
Nichts mit Cash in der Schweiz bunkern, du bist ständig im Dispo
Dreihundert im Italia
Blinker links, drückt wie in 'ne Vagina
Du gibst dir Bukkake-Shows, bis du drin ertrinkst
Ich füll den ganzen Becher ab wie 'n Winzer, Stinker
Was für strammer Man? Du lässt dich pimpern
In der Hoffnung, dass du Kinder kriegst (This is a men's world!)
Doch du schminkst dich wie Schlampen
Charter' lieber mal 'nen Flieger
Und verschwind in den Anden für immer
Sie lobpreisen Kotstreifen als Hoheiten
Weil sie teilen, dass sie auf Schwänze glotzen wie Klosteine
Dem Tod geweiht, du kannst dich gern erschießen wie Cobain
Rest in Peace, nur keiner vergießt für dich 'ne Träne, wenn du gehst
Ciao, bye, hau rein
King of Rap, mein Titel auf uneingeschränkte Laufzeit
Rapper kommen im Brautkleid, wollen sich paaren
Ich spitt' wie 'n Donnergrollen in die Membrane holt mal die Bahn
Kill im Wahn tausend Hundesöhne hässlich wie Grendel
Geb' diesen Clowns ein romantisches Happy Ending
Du kennst mich und weißt ich spitt' so heiß
Wenn ich was aus Stahl seh', verbiegt es
Kein Scheiß, ich hab den Beweis wie Dilated Peoples
Am Tag immer friedlich, doch ich warte
Frage „Bist du schon am schlafen?“
Keine Antwort, lad' und erschieß' dich
Was für Menschenrecht, handle das wie ein Assassin
Kill bis auf paar jeden MC im Spiel für diesen Kram den sie bieten

Dein Highlight ist Thailand denn du Made findest Knaben so niedlich
Frag nicht nach Features, wag es dich niemals

Bei dir läufts nur aus den Nebenhöhlen starke Sinusitis
Und glaub mir ich flow wahnsinnig quasi als ob man grade verliebt ist

Stinkt schlimm zum Himmel, die Nase verzieht sich
Was für Sagen und Mythen, ich feuer' heute auf euch Toys

Ihr spielt Shows ohne Grund, brotlose Kunst
Die Gage ist niedrig, bezahlt nicht die Miete
Sie wollten Gold, aber graben nach Kiesel
Sind enttäuscht, denn ihre Zeit läuft rasend wie Hasen und Beagle
Guck, nur 'ne kurze Phase, das war's du Hund
Der Grund deines Sturzes war deine unsympathische Art gepaart

Die sie nie mehr beenden, werden
geschändet und für Jahre erniedrigt

Ihr Geist verstrahlt und besessen, ich weiß
Wessen Bücher ihr lest und welcher Regel ihr Folge leistet
Kein Int'resse an 'nem Pakt mit diesem Pack
Sie präsentieren ihren Kack mit 'nem scheiß strahlenden Lächeln
Die Offerte 'n Becher Blut für'n Platz an der Spitze
Wie könnt' ich so was jemals unterschreiben?
Lass mal die Witze, wirklich jetzt, rede nicht mit mir
Was denkst du, wer ich bin, du Flasche?
Lieber brenn' ich zu Asche, bevor ich das unterstütze
Trau' keiner Schlange, fick eure 48 Gesetze
Wem willst du Hund droh'n? Zu dir bin ich herloser, als Untote
Sie wollen mich umpolen, Hirn waschen
Nennen ihre Männer Lemminge, da sie sich grundlos führ'n lassen
Psycho-SMS in der Nacht, ? die Fotze die Sekte
Diese Drecksäcke boxen nur Schwächere
Erzähl'n ich würde sterben an Krebs
Doch besser für dich, wenn es nicht so ist
Sonst kämst du auf jeden mit würd' ich geh'n
Probier' die Fakten zu dreh'n, mein Shit ist die Wahrheit
Ich wär' mehr Mann, als ihr, mit 'nem Kilt und Armreif
Zerbrech' dich wie'n Sparschwein, tu nur, als wärst du fromm
Aber Luzifer ist dein Gott und du willst ihm nah' sein
Ruft Mahlzeit, ich reiß' ihre Köpfe ab, sie glotzen wie Pferde
Rotz' auf die Erde und es wächst 'n Wahrzeichen

? Lauf' wie ?, keine Bars, nur Images, Mann
Stellt sie zur Rede, sie blocken ab und passen ?
Lass die Wut aus dem Zwinger, ich mach' dich Spinner so lange runter
bis du meinst, dass du grade Stimmen aus dem Himmel vernimmst

Sie würfeln nicht, kein Zufall, es ist durchgeplant

Und du gehst von dannen als ob dich Winzling 'nen Sturm trifft
Weg aus dem Irrenhaus, ihr seid für die Inspiration Gift
Schalt den Lap aus, ich jage euern Zirkus in die Luft
Keine Zweifel und Schwachstellen, bei mir wirkt nicht dieser Stuss
Ich bin das Ganze, das gesamte Paket
Von der Stage zum Train im Moonwalk
Pause, Ich zeig dir Schwanz, wo du stehst
Guck, ihr rappt euch um Kopf und Kragen
Jedes Wort ist so destruktiv
Poste mein' Standort im Wolkenatlas statt Facebook
Zieh 'ne Karte, warte, ich prophezeih' dir die Zukunft
Am Ende entpuppt sich dein komplettes Leben als Trugschluss
Jede Entscheidung falsch, jede Zeile verschwendet
Nur leeres Gesülze, keine Courage, sich zu verändern
Du bist Darsteller, jemand der 'nen Rapper imitiert
Nicht mehr nur gefickt, sie haben diese Mucke infiziert
Blick auf's Karma-Konto, sammel gute Taten
Bring sie alle um, lieber jetzt als gleich
Ihr habt lang genug gewartet

Asche zu Asche, Staub zu Staub
Wenn du es ihnen nicht glaubst, komm und schau
Wie ich alle Hunde begrabe, deine
Träume gehen in Rauch auf, ich brauch keine Krümel
Rap ist mein, ich will den ganzen Kuchen haben
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet, dass ein Album erscheint)
Denn ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet, dass ein Album erscheint)

Scheint als wärt ihr von der Erde völlig losgelöst wie Major Tom
Habt den Sektor verlassen, aus dem man irgendwann wiederkommt
Keine Sonderrechte, Knecht, es endet wie gehabt
Denn 99 von 100 Rappern enden leider wieder als Hartzer
Ich weiß, trauriger Fakt
Mach ruhig Auge, glaub ich verkack
Aber es ist Raps Schweizer Uhrwerk
Ihr kriegt mich kaum aus dem Takt
Ich bring den Raum zum illuminieren bis diese Parasiten erblinden
Wir sind uns fremd, teilen nicht die gleiche Gesinnung
Als wollten sie mir was Gutes und hätten mich grad entdeckt
Wie, dich Fotze featuren? Wofür hab ich zwanzig Jahre gerappt?
Und ich bin lieber in 'nem Sarg als auf 'nem Track mit dir
Nenn' es „Interview mit 'nem Vampir“
Weil du in meiner Welt nicht existierst
Deine Diskografie, das Manifest der Verzweiflung
Sieh, ich spalt' deinen Schädel zu dem Beat hier und tauf es Eisprung
Keine Skrupel, lass sie bluten und zermalme den Feind
Ich versprech' es, ihr müsst nur warten, bis mein Album erscheint

Asche zu Asche, Staub zu Staub
Wenn du es ihnen nicht glaubst, komm und schau
Wie ich alle Hunde begrabe
Deine Träume gehen in Rauch auf, ich brauch keine Krümel
Rap ist mein, ich will den ganzen Kuchen haben
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet, dass ein Album erscheint)
Denn ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)

Schau sie dir an, die Rapper lassen dich im Stich
Wollen an die Spitze, aber landen auf dem Strich
Schlucken Wichse, haben 'ne Latte im Gesicht
Und dabei sagen sie „Ich mache nur mein Ding!“ Ah
Ihr macht einen Scheiß, gestern Rap
Heute Trap, übermorgen Rock
Schizophren, als würd' ein kleiner Mann in ihren Ohren hocken
Ihr seid das beste, was mir je passiert ist
Wirklich, ich muss euch danken, denn ihr inspiriert mich
Hab' euch mein Herz ausgeschüttet auf GP
Und jetzt benutz' ich wieder deutsche Rapper als WC
Sie wollen nach oben, aber stecken im EG
Diese Lügenbarone, ich durchschau' sie wie 'n CT
Der Beat ist ein trojanisches Pferd
Die Melodie so süß wie Zuckerwatte
Ich zerstör' dich, ohne zu erwähnen dass ich 'ne Mutter hacke
Von den Tapes bis zur Spitze der Charts

Komm rum wie 'n Karawan, fokussiert wie Kameras
Ich stepp' ans Mic und zerstöre jeden Rapper wie Gammastrahlen
Twilight, Blutsauger, Wesen ohne Skrupel
Für ein kleines bisschen Dubel (Was?) kneten sie die Nudel
Das ist Deutschrap, Inzest, Fritzl-Programm
Ein mal kurz die Nase geschnäubt, du hast dein' Grips in der Hand
Es bleibt das Bargeld aus und sie landen in der Klapse
Ich bin Staatsheld, auch ohne Landung auf dem Hudson
Statt zu handeln wollen sie quatschen
Darwin dreht sich grade im Grab um
Der Arme denkt sich, was 'ne Schande für die Affen
Verwandel sie mit 'ner Zeile zu Feinstaub
Erst Welle im Video, danach kleinlaut heimbrausen im DriveNow
Tausende Scheißhaufen als Rapper verkleidet
Komm und hol sie alle
Ihr erlebt mich am Mikrofon nur im Rocky-Modus
Vom Proberaum bis zur Spitze der Charts
Der letzte echte MC, er ist da

Ich mach' meine Mucke anders, schreibe, spucke Anthrax
Deutsche Rapper, du kannst sie in Reisebussen ankarr'n
Stricher erbleichen, ich dropp' Bomben wie FunkFlex
Du bist nicht mehr der gleiche, als ob dein Onkel dich anfässt
Familiendrama, du bist das Ergebnis, wenn mal Präser platzen
Was für „läuft“, ich bitte euch, bei ihm nennt man das Käfer kraxeln
Morgens in die Jordans, abends grüß die Käseplatte
Ekelhaft, die Zähne sehen so aus, als ob sie Lepra hatten
Sperr' dich in 'ne Legebatterie, gib deine Eier ab, Shit
Deine Karriere war kürzer als die eines Babystramplers
Begrabe Spinner, lass sie lauschen, wie die Gräser wachsen
Mit 'ner Stimme so atemberaubend wie 'n Leberhaken
Federführend in jeder Sparte, breit gefächertes Sortiment wie Krämerladen
Ich spitte präziser als 'ne Laserwaffe
Rapper leben Peter-Zwegat-Hustle
Statt die Arme, könnt Ihr jetzt trainieren
Wie man den ganzen Tag lang mit 'nem Bagel satt ist

Ah, sie sagen, bring' dich mal um
Töte dich, tu's für uns, tu's für die Kunst
Tu' alles, was nötig ist, mach 'n Punkt
Zöger' nicht, gib dem Ding nur 'n Grund
Nimm dir dein Leben, werd' ein (Märtyrer!)
Nimm dir dein Leben, werd' ein (Märtyrer!)
Nimm dir dein Leben, werd' ein (Märtyrer!)
Nimm dir dein Leben, werd' ein (Märtyrer!)

Sag mir, wie kannst du bestehen, wenn du kein' Standpunkt bringst?
Tu auf Tier, das erklärt, warum du dich wie'n Bandwurm windest
Rapper nehmen Schwanz in den Mund (Wann?) Wenn der Ansturm stimmt
Wenn die Aussicht auf Anerkennung winkt, meine Ankunft klingt
Als würden Düsenjäger eben auf 'nem Flugzeugträger landen
Wenn ich Reden halte, kriegen sie größere Ohren als Elefanten
Nenn' dich den Illusionist, denn deine als die Fee erwähnte Schlampe
Entpuppt sich näher betrachtet als 'ne Megabratze
Ich will dich killen und den Boden mit dem Gewebe pflastern
Endgegner, Feinde zerfallen, als ob sie Corega-Tabs sind
Masken sind vorbei, jetzt kommt Lederstrappse
Ich will nicht mal jeden hassen, doch sie liefern Gründe wie per-Meter-Ware
Ich muss 'n Liter Kleber atmen, um zu sein wie sie
Scheiß MCs, pflanz sie in Reih und Glied wie im Schrebergarten
Ich bin spendabel, aber auf Rap bezogen Egomane
Sie schreien „Essah, leben und leben lassen!“ Ich glaube nicht

Ah, sie sagen, bring' dich mal um
Töte dich, tu's für uns, tu's für die Kunst
Tu' alles, was nötig ist, mach 'n Punkt
Zöger' nicht, gib dem Ding nur 'n Grund

Jeder Verse ein gottgesegnetes Manuskript
Spitten auf höchstem Niveau und trotzdem sind's alles Hits
Dein Lebensglück obliegt der Laune und Gnade eines ander'n Mannes
Somit machst du dich vom Clown zu 'nem Sklaven egal
wie lang auch dein Schwanz ist
Der Einzige, der gefickt wird, bist du
Fuck, das ist Fakt, keine Sache der Ansicht
Mein Flow todbringend, Kamikaze, infektiös
Mach' auf Sportlehrer, Body-Mass-Index schön
Er ist Fake, Laminat, Ausweichprodukt
Ackern für Mindestlöhne, macht nicht mehr Wind als Föhne
Ich bin der Hammer-tor-nado, Herz kälter als Fargo
Schieß' ohne Vorwarnung wahllos, mein Wort ist Gesetz
Ich sprech's und es kommt zum Tragen wie Ford Cargos
Reservier' dir bei Marsano 'n festliches Gesteck
Für den bestmöglichen Fall, dass du verreckst
Werf's dir zu, in den Sarkophag
So, mit dir bin ich fertig, jetzt next
Diese MCs flüchten ins Exil, wenn ich rapp'
Sind Jünger, doch sehen neben mir alt aus
Wenn du meinst, das wächst dir über den Kopf, heul' dich bei Udo Walz aus
Gerafft? Das hier nennt man Mucke Slash Wissenschaft
Die Quintessenz ist S, gib' mir den Beat
Ich blüh' auf, wie nach dem Winterende
Pfennigfuchser, sie würden töten für Klimpergeld
Reiben Sack und vergreifen sich
Nur an Schwachen wie Kinderschänder
Lade nach, feuer' auf euch Stümper ständig unverändert
Jahrelang schon rücksichtlos als hätt' ich 'nen Job als blinder Henker
Bring's zu Ende, schick' sie zu den Engeln
Eventuell dem Fürst der Finsternis
Nix mit Business, ich seh' das zu verbissen (Biatch!)
Als wär' ich nur der King dieser Mucke (niemals!)

Willkommen in der echten Welt
Wo du um Luft auf der Bühne ringst
Wo man erkennt, dass dein ganzes Leben 'ne Lüge ist
Wo dich keiner deiner Soldaten beschützt und hütet
Es ist anders jetzt was du konntest, genügt hier nicht

Verweil' in der Luft wie Staub, bevor er sich legt
Die Welt, sie steht unter dem Gesetz der Dualität

Schlussgefolgert, wenn ich richtig liege, liegen sie was? Falsch
Richtig, dein Kommentar, behalt's im Hals
Du willst mein Wissen? Check' den Informationsgehalt im Salz
Wenn ich schwitze, streckst du die Arme wie
Dhalsim und willst ein bisschen ab, sie nenn' mich Spielverderber
Wie'n Feuerspucker bei Kissenschlachten
Wichser, mach mal nicht auf wild und wacker, du Spacken
Hast nur ne Macke aufgrund der verkackten Haptik deiner Gattin
Schau' Clown, deine Zeit ist um, Schall und Rauch, rapp' nie mehr
Jeder kriegt die Galle, wenn du auftauchst wie der MacKeeper
Bei mir um ein Feature betteln du Dilettant
In dem Moment überschreitest du 'ne Grenze wie'n Immigrant
Ich muss dich warnen, Affe
Dieser Mumpitz-Stumpfsinns-Flow
auf einem Track mit mir, deine Karriere endet in Mahnwachen
Ungewöhnlich, plötzlich zittern Spitter vor Furcht
Mach's wie Uli Hoeneß, fütter diese Ficker mit Wurst
Und das Schönste ist, sie betiteln ihre Mütter als Huren
Und sind plötzlich wieder als Brüder auf Tour
Das ist absurd, Men in Black, Erinnerung weg
Richte den Kurs kurz, nix straight
Dein Leben geht direkt um die Kurve
Fronten um jeden Preis, Welle geschmackloser als Gurken
Null Wachstum, diese Rapper stagnieren und schlagen Wurzeln
Ich bin fresh wie nach der Geburt
Mich biten widerstrebt jeglichem Sinn
Denn meine Worte sind krebserregend wie Shrimps
Erinner' dich, ich bin nicht nur der King dieser Mucke (was sonst?)

Was für deutscher Rap?
Spar's dir für Wendy, erzähl' mir nix vom Pferd
Ich fühl' mich grad wie der Crocodile Hunter, merke den Stich im Herz
Scherzartikel-MCs - Rote Nase, lachender Mund auf der Suche nach Krümeln
Wie Ungeziefer, sie krabbeln herum
Lass sie machen, die Hunde stehen Spalier, links
Und rechts den Schwanz in der Hand
Aber wen wollt ihr ficken? Des ist 'ne Sackgasse
Kryptischer Flow und ihr meint es zu entschlüsseln
Dazu müsstet ihr erst mal jeden möglichen Code besitzen, wie Abwasser
Meine Bars ein lyrisches Massaker
Las auf YouTube als Propaganda
Essah bricht die Rekorde wie „Oppa Gangnam“
Und keine Vergleiche, Opfer, das sind Statements
Du verziehst die Fresse als ob Rocky grade „Adrian!“ ruft
Beweg' Rapper zum Suizid, nenn' es Club der toten Dichter

Ich verleih ihnen den Grimmepreis (Wieso?)
Diese Blender schieben sich Filme
Lehnen sich weiter aus dem Fenster, als Vanilleeis
Zerstör' sie, hinterlasse nur Trümmerteile
Radiere den Virus aus, ansonsten wird er immer dreister
Nenn mich H-I-P H-O-P Sanitizer
Begieß sie mit Napalm
Sie labern, schmücken sich mit fremden Federn wie Indianer
Bitte glaub mir tauf' deine liebste Dampfer
Nicht weil das Schwein so fett ist wie Sau
Ne sie läuft aus den Armen 'n triefenden Hahn
Hat miefige Haare, mieser Zahnbelag
Seite an Seite zieht ihr in den Krieg der Feinde
Nietet sie easy um mit ihrem Atem
Elite-Marder, ein Stück Schmutz
Und dennoch krass und über die fremde Spezies
Ich kann mit diesen MCs nicht interagieren
Und jetzt wird klar, wer ist das Schaf und wer der Wolf
Ich fress' ihn auf, erzählt von Bentleys
Aber der Lügenbold hat 'nen Golf, was soll's
Andere Art, andere Werte
Deswegen kill' ich sie alle, bevor ich mir die Namen merke

Warte kurz, ich lade durch und schieße auf dich Horst
Lass dich fliegen, wie in Trance
Mädels lieben diese Songs, als wär'n das Isabel Marants
Geh' auf die Venus, ich will sehen wie die deutschen MCs performen
Sie ficken sich gegenseitig vor aller Augen in Ordnung
Ein Haufen aus Fleischpenisse
Korpus nicht erklärbar mit Worten
Dinge, die du nie mehr vergisst wie 'n ewiger Ohrwurm
Vor zwei Jahrzehnten geboren und du willst meine Kunst bewerten?
Ich ramm' dein' Rumpf stumpf in die Erde, sag mir, wie wär das?
Sie schlafen ein, aber ich auf kein'
Ratter' durch den Takt, wie 'ne Nähmaschine
Wer von uns siegt, liegt auf der Hand wie 'ne Lebenslinie
Eine Zeile, er macht 'nen schnelleren Abgang als Schneelawinen
Ich push' diese Mucke, ihr fickt sie, ob das ein fairer Deal ist
Niemals, deswegen geh' ich weiter bis sie in Gräbern liegen
Nur wenn es dann für den Letzten vorbei ist, erlang ich Seelenfrieden
Lass sie kommen, sie bekommen ihren Gnadenstoß, ich frage bloß
Wozu erwähnen, für mich sind sie namenlos

„Tot oder Lebendig” auch""
„John Bello“ bis „Aura“, sie haben jedes Album blind gekauft
Blaupause für Deutschen Rap
Sie kopieren es tausendfach
Sie haben immer an dich geglaubt, Savas
Kids sind mitgewachsen, jeder ist heut dein größter Fan
Schon immer, für immer
Lass sie ruhig erzählen

Heute so, morgen so
Zweifel und Bestätigung
Du weißt es nicht sie schauen dir in die Augen
Oder drehen sich um
Heute hier, morgen da
Bestätigung und Zweifel
Der Teufelskreis, entscheide dich
Was richtig oder falsch ist

Heute so, morgen so
Heute hier, morgen da
Heute so, morgen so
Der Teufelskreis entscheide dich
Was richtig oder falsch ist",Zweifel und Bestätigung
Kool Savas,"İstanbul'un yukarısından sizi bir arabaya mı bindirdik
Bir taksiye mi bindirdik
Yoksa, sizi göndermezsem
Herifler, polisler, geliyor, götürecekler

Or'dan çıkıp kaçıp geçmeze Bulgaristan tarafına
Geçerse korkuyu atlatıyorduk gari",Anekdoten aus Istanbul 2
Kool Savas,"Ein Wort von hier
Ein Wort von dort
Bis der Kopf kreist und ich nicht mehr weiß, wo ich bin
Gut, dass ihr wisst, wer ihr seid
Gut, dass ihr ein Ziel habt
Stimmt, ich kann nicht mitziehen
Denn ich blieb ein Kind
Bin gefangen im Geist
Ein Glückspilz, ein Nichtsnutz, ein Niemand, ein Träumer
Naiv und bescheuert
Dumm, dass ich an mich glaub, dumm dass ihr das nicht teilt
Dumm, dass ich euch nicht folgen will, es tut mir so Leid

Denn hätt' ich auf euch gehört
Dann wär' ich wohl heute nicht hier
Hätt' ich auf euch gehört
Dann wär' ich genauso wie ihr
Hätt' ich auf euch gehört
Dann wär' ich wohl heute nicht hier
Hätt' ich auf euch gehört
Dann wär' ich genauso wie ihr",Auf Euch gehört (Interlude)
Kool Savas,"Sie machen Auge auf mein Haus, Auge auf meine Frau
Sehen mich im Auto und werfen's drauf wie 'n giftigen Pfeil 
Guck, sie machen (Auge)
Sie machen (Auge)
Sie machen Auge auf den Erfolg, Auge auf den Besitz
'N Spiegel als Schild, ich block' es und schick' es zurück
Guck, sie machen (Auge)
Sie machen (Auge)

Laber mich nicht zu mit „Läuft bei dir!“ Als hättest du je was gegönnt!?
Du würdest mir alles nehm', bis hin zum letzten Hemd, wenn du könntest
Verfluchst mich und wünschst mir, dass ich untergeh' und nix schaff'
Mentales Powertraining, dein verdammtes Auge gibt mir Kraft
Babaanne wusst' es, sprach täglich ein Gebet für mich
Das Ergebnis ihr Enkel wurd' zum wichtigsten deutschen Rapper, der lebt
Guck, ich hab' alles investiert, geackert und wie blöd geschwitzt
Dennoch probierst du, mich zu sabotieren mit dem bösen Blick
Leute zweifeln an „Auge“, bis es sie trifft
Werden verrückt oder verlieren alles, manche wollen nicht ma', dass man drüber spricht
Mein Vater bat mich nur „Protz nicht rum mit dem Geld, das du verdienst!“
Auch wenn er nicht dran glaubt, weiß er genau, das Auge ist aktiv
Ich bin vorsichtig und pass' auf
Selbst die Menschen, die du kennst, sind manchmal missgünstig 
Und wünschen sich insgeheim, dass du brennst
Wenn du kein' Schlaf mehr findest, weil du grundlos aufwachst in der Nacht
Frag dich wer hat bloß auf mich Auge gemacht?
Die Wichser

Sie machen Auge auf mein Haus, Auge auf meine Frau
Sehen mich im Auto und werfen's drauf wie 'n giftigen Pfeil

'N Spiegel als Schild, ich block' es und schick' es zurück
Guck, sie machen (Auge)
Sie machen (Auge)

Und nur ein Heuchler würd' sich weigern, mein' Erfolg zu zelebrieren
Wenn du sagst, es steht schon geschrieben, was mit uns sein soll und passiert
Denn im Alleingang hob ich Deutschrap aus der Taufe hier
Anstelle laut zu applaudieren, ist ihr Dank dafür, sie machen Auge
Konzentrieren sich nur auf mich statt auf sich selbst zu schauen
Im Glauben dran, ihr Leben könnt' sich irgendwie verbessern, wenn sie mir meins versauen
Lächeln mich an, meint ihr echt, ich bin so dämlich!?
Ich weiß doch, würd' ich auf einmal das Zeitliche segnen, wärt ihr begeistert
Die Antwort, wieso ich so gut wie nie im Fernsehen bin
Hype bringt neidvolles Auge, was selbst deine Liebsten gefährden könnte
Und irgendwer ist angepisst, sieht dich verantwortlich
Für sein Scheitern, Streit und Angriffe sind der Preis für das Rampenlicht
Behaupten „du bist der Beste, mein Bruder!“, doch hinterm Rücken
Mustern sie unbemerkt deine Frau mit lüsternen Blicken
Nennen dich Bastard und Schlimmeres
Denn sie lieben's, zu erklären, warum sie losen, doch hassen den Gewinner, die Wichser

Sie machen Auge auf mein Haus, Auge auf meine Frau
Sehen mich im Auto und werfen's drauf wie 'n giftigen Pfeil 
Guck, sie machen (Auge)

Wir beide wissen, du wünschst mir den Tod

Ey, deutscher Rap hat mich gefickt und jetzt ficke ich zurück
Gib mir ein bisschen Cash, ich mach' daraus 'ne Mille, wenn ich spitt'
Und deshalb kling' ich so verrückt, Dicka, ist so, Schizo
Nicht so mit mir reden, Bruder, sonst gibt's Klitschko (yo)
Wenn du mich nicht kennst, ja, dann check mal mein' Style
Der's perfekt, dis Montez „Warum rappst du?“ Part 2
Es gibt für mich keinen Grund mehr, an der Technik zu feilen
Ich bin endlich bereit, wenn du checkst was ich mein' Essahdamus",Auge
Kool Savas,"Baby, ich bin ein Rapper, ich kann es nicht mehr ändern
Nicht wie diese Blender, du sprichst gerade mit 'ner Legende

Denn Baby, ich bin ein Rapper, Baby, ich bin ein Rapper
Baby, ich bin ein Rapper, Baby, ich bin ein Rapper, oh oh oh

Sechsen auf dem Zeugnis, trotzdem heute die eins im Spiel
Klassentreffen, Leute glotzen dumm als wär' 'n Geist erschien'
Augen größer als die Zuwachsrate bei der AfD
Ex-Lehrer hoffen unterwürfig auf ein „Na, wie geht's?“
Erfülle das Klischee, doch nur damit ihr was zu reden habt
Erfolg beflügelt, stimmt und ich segel' grad wie 'n Pelikan
Imagewandel nicht in Sicht, ich dominier' die Hauptbühne
Andere machen bloß Theater, inszenierte Aufführung
Jeder Stein im Weg wurde zum Glied in der Kette
Deswegen reicht sie tief bis zum Solarplexus, Guck Baby ich bin ein Rapper
Und dein Trendopfer-Freund ist keine Konkurrenz
Ein Niemand im Vergleich zu 'nem Monument
Meine Jogginghose hängt wie 'n Pennerlook
Dennoch geiern Bitches, feiern mich
Und würden für den Fame ohne nachzudenken die Eier küssen
Das Gas treten bis es scheppert, Kickdown linke Spur
Leben ohne den Wecker es geht nicht besser Baby, ich bin ein Rapper

Ich kann es nicht mehr ändern

Sechsen auf dem Zeugnis, aber heute in 'nem AMG
Beim Klassentreffen kotzen die Leute, wenn sie mich rasen sehen
Es gehört dazu, dass irgendwelche Neider fronten
Dafür fall' ich aber weich auf die Schweizer Konten
Manche Frauen haben nicht gegeben
Heute wollen sie mir ein Kind andrehen
Seh' mein Gesicht ab heute auf jeder Litfaßsäule
Erfüll' mir grade meine Kindheitsträume
Alle Fans waren damals Neider
Heute zieh' ich Topmodels an wie ein Stardesigner
Für euch war Rap nur 'n Lärmpegel, ihr wollte es nicht ernst nehmen
Die Länder, die ich heute seh', kennt ihr nur vom Fernsehen
Die Schweißtropfen auf meinem Weg sind nicht zu zählen
Ich halt' den Kreis klein und rede nicht mit jedem
Ich rede nicht, ich setz' Treffer
KC ist um Längen besser, das Mainstream wurde geentert
Mein Leben hat sich verändert
Baby, ich bin ein Rapper!

Ich kann es nicht mehr ändern
Nicht wie diese Blender, du sprichst gerade mit 'ner Legende
Guck, Baby, ich bin ein Rapper, ich kann es nicht mehr ändern

Sie behaupten Rap wär' keine Mucke, okay
Dann fick' ich halt meine Feinde auf 'ner seichten Gitarre
Sieh da, sie lutschen Schwanz wie kleine Nutten oh je
Enge Hosen, Symbol für sie sind dem Teufel verfallen
Jedes Wort hier begräbt dich Hund gleich unter sich wie 'n Komet
Heiz ihnen ein und Mcees sterben ab wie Korallen
Im Ernst, Dicker, nicht die Verkäufe, die Psyche ist dein Problem
Keine Schüsse, hörst du's knallen, durchbrech ich grad' den Schall und steh hinter dir

Und bin da, wenn du rufst
Wie der Candyman
Ein dumpfer Schlag und du badest in Blut
Jetzt mach' ein Selfie mit der Handycam
Und ich geb' dir mein Wort
Ich erlös dich heut' Abend, du schließt deine Augen und gehst
Zeig mich an wegen Mord
Keiner hört dich im Grab, Jedem laufen vor Freude die Tränen (die Tränen, die Tränen)
Und ich fühl mich so geil jetzt (geil, geil, geil, geil)
Von allen Sorgen befreit jetzt (frei, frei, frei, frei)
Die Euphorie macht mich high jetzt (high, high, high, high)
Einfach, weil dein Leben vorbei ist
Weil es vorbei ist

Jeder applaudiert
Denn dein Dasein, es geht den Bach hinab
Dein schlimmster Albtraum wird jetzt wahr
Und du fragst dich was hab ich falsch gemacht
Da hilft auch kein Undercut, kein James Blake kann dich noch retten jetzt
Sie wechseln ihre Form passend zum Wetter nicht SAV ich mache immer nur Battlerap
Tu nicht auf Künstler, du Bastard, als hätte die Welt auf die Pisse gewartet, bestimmt
Bitte sag mir Bescheid, wenn du meinst, dass niemand dein Ego zum Wanken bringt

Rede mit mir selbst, ich brauch' konstruktiven Input
Klopf' mir voller Inbrunst auf die Schulter, wenn keiner hinguckt
Aluhut auf fleek, man sagt, Zeit ist nur 'ne Erfindung
Das Bewusstsein verlässt den Wirt mit 'nem Windstoß
Stürme ziehen auf, Gewässer fluten das Land, das Ende naht
Meine letzten Worte sind lutsch meinen Schwanz!
Nur eine Reflexion aus der Höhle des Avatars
Sie machen sich auf die Reise, l-laufen im Kreise, suchen nach Panama
Mein Gewissen ist'n schwarzer Spiegel mit einem Riss
Auch wenn du's gern hättest wir sind nicht vom selben Stern wie bei Ich und Ich
Die Zeile, die dich mit Abstand am besten fickt, ist du bist du
Jede Line wirbelt deine Birne wild umher, nenn' es Fruity Loops
Deutscher Rap, meine Rosemaries, Baby, diese verfluchte Brut
Schieß' und beende ihr mickriges Dasein, ich hab genug zutun
Sisyphusarbeit, Lines deformieren deinen Schädel
Du Nutte, kam rein, reformierte die Szene wie Luther
Statt Penisse lutschen, zeig uns dein Ziel und erreich' es
In zehn Jahren, ich dagegen brauche zehn Minuten das reicht 
Schon, Jigga nahm mich zur Seite 2008
Meinte wie willst du ein Spiel gewinnen
Wenn du zulässt, dass jemand anders die Regeln macht?
(Steel sharpens Steel. You gotta earn your spot. It's not given)
Drum hol' ich die Ficker schnell wieder herunter bevor sie noch abdriften
Traurige Emojis auf Twitter alles was bleibt
Sag die Wahrheit, sie kommentieren nur dein Bauch wird auch immer dicker
Saug an dem Schlauch hier, du Wichser

Nehm' die Last dieser Erde auf
Meine Schultern, lad' nach, raste gefährlich aus
Wenn ich geh, dann nicht ohne dass ich Rapper mit mir runterzieh'
Der Ton in meiner Stimme macht den Unterschied

Ich hab das immer ernst gemeint
Sie hoffen, sie könnten uns abfucken, abfucken
Ich hab das immer ernst gemeint
Wollen echte MCs abschaffen, abschaffen
Ich hab das immer ernst gemeint

Ich will ein' Beat, auf dem man Rapper ficken kann wie früher
Komme durch die Tür und kille jeden ohne große Mühe
Fake Pussyrapper holen sich Hype ab
Ich schwöre, dass ihr scheitert
Wenn ihr Streit macht zum Einsatz hereinplatzt
Packe eure Bilder an die Dartscheibe
Und bearbeite deine Tragweite brutal wie ein Hardliner
Chartrider werden eingesperrt wie in Malaysia
Betrete den Käfig wie ein Profi-MMA-Fighter
Dicker, fahr weiter, der Markt leidet an paar Bitern
Bars meißel ich wie ein maßschneidender Arbeiter
Während ihr den Haarspaltern aus der USA weiter
Nacheifert, drop ich meine Bomben wie ein K Einser
Na, Kleiner? Geh und sag's weiter wenn die Staatsfeinde Parts schreiben
Musst du dir ein' Anzug für dein' Sarg schneidern
Hier kommt der Ritter, der ins Tat schreitet
Ich durchtrenne Drahtseile, an den' euer Leben hängt und erschaff' neue Grabsteine
Zweihundert Kmh Style ist die Fahrweise
Wenn ich Bars reime, hält mich gar keiner
Ihr Fotzen solltet euern Neid unter Kontrolle kriegen
Deutscher Rap ist Pussy geworden durch euer Rollenspiel
Willkommen in Hollywood-Rap, Digga, Director's Cut
Ich hab keine Liebe für Magazine und Manager
Essahdamus, der King of Rap hat's vorausgesagt
Bist du konsequent, wirst du eines Tages ausgezahlt

24 Takte Rapper killen, diese Rapper sind keine Rapper
Sondern nur Rapper, die sagen, dass sie Rapper sind
Wenn dann ein Rapper wie Essah, PA, Banjo, Rapper killen
Sagen diese Rapper jetzt mal besser, dass sie kein Rapper sind
Fakt ist, es gibt nicht viele Rapperkills
Fucker, du kommst mir vor wie in 'nem Splatterfilm wenn du mal ohne Backup bist 
Guck mal Bruder, nimm mal dein' Tesafilm über dein' besten Beat
Im Studio fühlst du dich in Röhrenjeans wie'n Schmetterling
Ich sag, guten Tag, hello, ich punch paar Bars, Bello
Frühstücke Rapper wie'n paar Kellog's (Go tell 'em)
Warum macht eine Gruppe auf Straße so hart Welle?
Ihr kriegt wegen altem Kamellen im Park schellen
Absprachen wie Kartelle, sie reden hinter deinem Rücken
Nein, du hast keinerlei Freunde, Holmes, du bist 'ne Tankstelle
Kids wollen Riesenrad, Zuckerwatte und Scooter fahren
Bei Papa dann Huckepack auf den Schultern dann zum Schufa-Amt
Ich weiß, die Welt will Glutamat
Der kleine Bruder kennt die Best-Of's vom Wu-Tang-Clan und 2Pac noch ausm Supermarkt
Wunderbar, du denkst, du bist Superman mit Umhang an
Houston ist nicht Wuppertal lass die Finger mal vom Hustensaft
Guck mal bitte kurz, wie'n G in die Digicam
Stimmt, Robert de Niro ist auch nur noch Comedian
Lass mal das Scherzen sein, Rap ist im Herzen meins
Ah, ich hab das immer ernst gemeint

Mit fünf war mein Leben noch in Ordnung
Mit sechs entdeckte ich 'ne schwarze Wolke am Himmel, die mich verfolgte
Mit sieben konnt' ich kein türkisch, hab die Sprache vergessen
So als hätt' man mich in Aachen resettet
Mit acht gedacht, ich wär'n Superheld, könnt' Baba retten
Hörte einmal seine Stimme, doch die Worte blieben stecken
Mit neun bekam ich in die Fresse, hab mich nicht gewehrt
Denn mir fehlte der Vater, der mir erklärte seinen Mann zu stehen
'Ne Irre wollte mich mit zehn entführen, zerrte mich in die Tür
Ich riss mich los, rannte, als wär' der Teufel hinter mir her
Mit elf sah ich meinen Vater wieder, doch
Wieder wurd' alles auf den Kopf gestellt und ich wurd' zu 'nem Berliner
Mit zwölf das erste Mal gefickt, war verliebt wie im Wahn
Wurd' mit dreihzehn von ihr das erste und das letzte Mal verarscht
Mit Vierzehn war es mir klar du hast kein' Freund auf der Welt
Drum befreunde dich mit dir selbst, so wurd' ich

Frag', warum ich solche Dinge erzähle
Denn ich such' und brauche endlich bisschen Ruhe für meine Kinderseele
Und wenn ich's nicht ausspreche, bleibt es nochmal dreißig Jahre
Unter meiner Haut stecken und versucht, mich aufzufressen
Hab gelebt, als wär' ich ständig auf der Flucht
Als wäre jeder von euch gegen mich, ständig unter Druck
Hab im Alltag geschwiegen, bin am Mikrofon geplatzt
Ein Junge rächt sich an der Welt, getrieben von dem Hass
Mit 'ner Hand voller Pech, 'nem Kopf voller Zweifel
An sich selbst, in der Stadt, die dich nur feiert, wenn du fällst
Muss mein altes Ich töten, um mein neues zu erleben
Will den Kreislauf beenden, diese Bürde hier nicht weitergeben
Jetzt schließ' die Ohren, um zu hören, was du brauchst, und
Schließ' die Augen, um zu sehen, wo du stehst
Hab mein Herz verborgen, aber schließ' die Kiste wieder auf
Denn mittlerweile geht es nicht mehr nur um

Einsam an der Spitze, unter mir die Restposten

Comme si j'allais m'endormir en classe et j'avais besoin d'un paire de claques pour me ressaisir
Tu vois?
Comme si j'avais besoin de perdre quelque chose pour avoir envie de le reprendre
La monotonie, ça m'insomne
Le quotidien, ça vous colle en bas, ça vous englue
Ça vous cloue au sol
J'ai besoin de vivre la vie comme une montagne russe, tu vois?
Regarde les étoiles c'est fou de briller autant
Mais je pense que quelque part quelqu'un nous regarde briller aussi dans son ciel et aimerait nous ressembler
J'aime ce vertige quand je regarde le ciel
J'ai l'impression que je pourrais me casser la gueule dans cette infinité",Holy Skit
Kool Savas,"Ich fick' die Beats hier trocken bis die Hose platzt
Schick' Rapper geschlossen auf den Walk of Shame wie der hohe Spatz
Komm bringen Move du Hure, hast die Wahl jetzt
Aber was du da machst ist alles für die Katz, wie das Cash von Lucas Cordalis
Der Zufall, er wartet manchmal in Form eines Meteoriten der dich zertrümmert
Meint ihr bringt mich zu Fall, erwartet, dass mich das kümmert
Nie, ich brech' die Fassade ein wie 'n Making-of
Der Mammut-MC, einziger Unterschied ist ich lebe noch
Diverse Emotionen im Part vertreten alles steht hier Kopf
Ficker chill', nicht Bill Cosby aber ich gebe Stoff
Du Esel opferst alles für Anerkennung, nimmst jede Chance
Er wittert Fame und kriegt'n Tunneblick wie wenn ein Mädel shoppt
Taui auf den Tisch und die Ehre hopst aus dem zehnten Stock
Du redest stolz und bläst bei 'nem Lady Boy bis der Penis tropft
Wie 'n Käsecroque der Megatron, S - Stimme wie 'n Nebelhorn
Die die Nacht durchbricht wie jemand der über'n Pegel soff

Lass sie glauben (ich bin fertig)

Schwarz-weißes Camouflage gut getarnt wie'n Erlkönig
Schwebend auf 'nem Hoverboard ehrwürdig wie'n Berglöwe

Was für sie von Bedeutung ist als ob es um Erdöl geht
Film ihren Todeskampf für den nächsten Teil von Sinister
Keine Gimmicks, der Flow echt Killer wie Mac Minister dein
Profilbild Raubkatze, doch chillen mit Kojoten
Fick mit mir du wirst mich nicht mehr los wie Sylvie den Piloten
Deutscher Rap, jede Silbe ist gelogen darum spitt' ich giftig
Wie auf Kohle grillen in der Wohnung wilder als 'n Mogli
Seh' MCs als blinde Antilopen, gefundenes Fressen
S mit dem Willen des Todes nur noch gewinnen für die Quote
Hundert Klicks und du Wichser bist am Springen wie'n Kobold
Guck' Rap ist drunter und drüber, ich entwirre diesen Knoten
Die Ikone, jede Strophe könnt ihr sniffen wie 'ne Droge
Stimme Aphrodisiakum Ollen fingern sich die Dose
Was für Player, du musst dringend wieder hobeln, bei dir kribbelt's in den Hoden
Schimmelt's in der Hose, wimmelt's vor Mikroben
Irres Biotop, sie hören das dämlich grinsend wie Emojis
Gehen nach Hause und verbinden ihrer Ohren 
Dimmen jedes Zimmer in der Wohnung 
Mich ficken? Wie bitte? Bevor ich verlier'
Schneid' ich ihn ab und werf' vor dir meinen Pimmel auf den Boden

Rap aus Paris hat dein Bewusstsein nicht geschwächt, sondern radiert
Mein Hass ist relativ monströs, drei Menschen sterben dran zu viert
Ihr sagt Deutschland sei nur noch nicht ready wenn's nicht läuft
Dabei ist ""bei Scheiße mitzieh'n"" eigentlich doch typisch deutsch
Absolut kein Plan wieso dein Produzent Frequenzen nutzt
Die außer Schmutz wie dir, nur ein Hund hören kann
Hip Hop heißt bei deinen Spasten ""wir haben nichts zu tun""
Und Internet - immer das selbe - Pattern nennt ihr deutschen Trap
Und dass all die Frauen in euren Videos Sturmmasken tragen
Kann ja selbst den dümmsten Menschen doch nur mutmaßen lassen
Dass ihr Trottel euch für sie schämt, oder sie sich für euch
Oder es ist jedes mal die selbe Nicole
Um deine Gang zu beschreiben, braucht es nicht einmal zwei Sätze
Eine Jeansweste kombiniert mit konzentrierter Wackness
Ihr denkt, ich hass' alle, sagen kann ich auch
Ich rapp' nicht aus Liebe, sondern weil mich Essahdamus braucht

Dein Gefronte hilft dir nur die Wahrheit nicht zu peilen
Stepp' ans Mic, ich töte deine Weltsicht mit nur einer Zeile
Leiste mehr für Rap mit nur einem Verse als du mit 16 Alben
Doch komm' nächstes Leben wieder um direkt auf ihn zu scheißen
2016 Deutschland bitet immer noch Ami-Müll aus Angst
Und macht dankbar Hype um jeden der im Grunde gar nichts kann
Du musst tagelang Google nach Erklärungen durchsuchen
Doch verstehst nicht einen Satz, hörst du den Soundtrack meiner Jugend
Ich bin cool und lebe meinen Traum wie Marcus Staiger
Sitz' im Bunker und hör mir den ganzen Tag lang euren Scheiß an
Denn Rap zieht mit sich, dass du irgendwann allein' bist
Und dass jeder Mensch der findet dass du besser rappst, dich bitet
Fans der ersten Stunde hassen uns jetzt, doch kaufen auch Alben von
Also kümmert's uns ein' Dreck, Audio 88, Yassin

Vor der Landung kommt der Sturz, sie sind dafür nicht bereit (oh yeah)
Sag mir, wer macht es so wie Essah (oh yeah)

Beginne meinen Part mit 'nem klaren Statement ich fick diese Rapper
Blick auf sie runter wie Gulliver, diese mickrigen Rapper

Wrack, such dir paar Ärzte raus
Da steht ein Pferd auf dem Flur, wie bei Klaus und Klaus

(Kein) Winterschlussverkauf doch schnappe zu
(Skills) proportional zu meiner Stimmung, ich hab genug
Spit wutentbrannter als ein tasmanischer Teufel
Jeder Track ein Supergau für ihre Welt, dramatische Folgen
Gib mir ein Feuchttuch, ich entfern' dieses Häufchen Elend mit einem Wisch
Man sagt doch, Leute lernen aus ihren Fehlern, du anscheinend nicht
Sie quatschen mich zu mit Gönnung und Turn Up, was für neuer Swag
Seitdem ich denken kann, ist das der größte Scheiß, den ich gehört hab'

Und du wärst jeden Tag am lutschen
Auf Twitter ein Star, aber führst ein Leben glanzlos wie Uniqlo
Wahre die Hoffnung, du wirst mal ein ganz großer Hundesohn
Mit Sicherheit, du hörst Pimmel, jumpst wie 'n Flummi hoch
Keine Skrupel, er würde jeden Schwanz für 'n Hunni blown
Fernfahrerschlampe, mit 'nem Manfred im Brummi wohnen
Nicht in der Spielo, ich häng' auf'm Wannsee im Gummiboot
Raps Unimoog, ich komponiere Banger und zerstör' Esel
Schädel werden kontrolliert gesprengt, wie das World Trade
Ich denke nicht, ich burn jeden, ich burn jeden, mach nicht auf King
Denn neben mir hast du Ficker nur dumm zu grinsen, wie die First Lady
SAV der Sensei, ich spritz ab wie Chemtrails
Du hörst nur, dass ich komm und schreist Mayday, wie Sven Väth
Keiner entgeht dem Endgegner, massig Klicks und Wahnsinnspromo

Deine dagegen stinken sowie Pisse nach Spargelessen
Und sowie die Essensreste in deinem wunderschönen Hipsterbart
Bist du hängen geblieben und hast leider immer noch keine Hits am Start
Ich hoffe du bist parat nach langem vegetieren
Kommt jetzt deine manische Phase, du willst für mich alles mal probieren
Aber jetzt wird’s funktionieren, fusionieren, B-U-C-H-S-tabieren
Nie verlieren, gut frisieren, etablieren
Keine Steine in den Nieren

Find' mich auf Klo scheißen, aber das tu ich nicht im sitzen

Abgeschottet vom Rest der Welt, Westberlin ist wie Winterfell

Blick auf ein Rorschach Bild meiner Zukunft seh' mich als Mann im Mond

Chicks fingern sich zu dieser Scheiße bis der Kitzler glüht
Sechs Gänge mit Blick auf den wilden Kaiser, nenn' es Kidsmenü
Was für hübscher Typ, ich bin ein alter Sack mit 'nem Bauch
Aber jedes Wort hier sagt mehr als 1000 Bilder, à la Micki Krause
Ich schick dich drauf wie Meth  frag deine Freunde wer ist der King
Wenn Rap nichts mehr bringt dreh ich komplett ab und tanz' nackt um 'ne Eule

Ob gestern, morgen oder heute MCs bleiben beute
Ich häute euch nach wie vor mit überschäumender Freude
Wir läuteten kein Zeitalter ein, sondern bedeuten
Die Unterscheidung von etwas und nichts, Weizen und Spreu sind
Begriffe, die erst sehr viel später auftauchen
Die nur Bitches wie du gebrauchen, um den Rauch der eignen Gefühle zu straucheln
Oder eher zu taumeln, nur um dann nach Pi mal Daumen eine Minute von der nächsten Eichel zu baumeln
Euch erreichen die Formeln kaum mehr als Offshore-Wellen
Küstenstreifen in Bordellen, schweifen die Gedanken am schnellsten
Doch du mit deiner vorschnellen Art, machst auf hart wenn ich dich mit dem Part begrab'

Girls machen massenhaft Service mit meinem Ding drin
Obwohl ich nicht inked bin, bin ich nicht unbeschrieben
Ich bin nicht jung geblieben, ich stehe auf um sieben

Für dies' Hip-Hop-Ding und mein Mittelfinger total solide
Also bitte bring mir diese Rapper her, egal, wie viele
In einem Jahr füllt ihr alle wieder das Regal bei Lidl
Deine Frau hat Dschungelfieber, steht auf Schokoladenriegel
Sie glaubt wohl nicht an die wahre Liebe, scheint kein Schlaf zu kriegen
Das kann wie beim Fakir mit Nagelbett am Nageln liegen
Naheliegend, deshalb grinst sie auch den ganzen Tag zufrieden
Ihr solltet unsere Namen und die, dieser Rapper niemals in einem Satz erwähnen
So wie die Worte „Erdogan“ und „Ziege“
Ich mache Butter bei die Fische, scheiß auf Margarine
Wo ist da der Haken wie Karabiner? Es hagelt Hiebe
Ich stehle Rappern das Spotlight, sie steh'n auf Schattenspiele
Träne im Auge, wie Harlekine, wenn ich gerade spitte
Die Nullen wären gern' Einsen, doch sind nur Datendiebe
Steuern aufs Ende zu wie '96 Pac im Beamer
Ihr hängt auf Tour nur mit Affen rum, so wie Justin Bieber
Dreh am Ende auf als hätt' ich 'ne Extrabatterie da
Statt Pokémons zu jagen, analysiert den Part hier lieber
Ende vom Verse, jetzt kennt ihr den Curse Text
Ihr Ficker

Glaubt ihr an die wahre Liebe?
Glaubt ihr wirklich, die Wichser rappen noch wenn sie keine Gage kriegen?
Also glaubt ihr an die wahre Liebe, huh?
Ich tu's erst, wenn sie alle tot in 'nem Graben liegen!

Glaubt ihr an die wahre Liebe?

Ich bin live von den Straßen Berlins
Came from New York City, Home of the crack fiends
Address carefully, choose my response
Alternative für Deutschland, lutsch meinen Schwanz
Like Kool Savas say it, LMS
Frauke Petry is the devil in the flesh
No justice, no peace, fuck swat gun cock
Buck shot, blood clot, bum drop, run cop
Rebelliere gegen das System
I spit on your grave and I piss on ya name
I come through your hood with Jérôme Boateng
I break all your bones and I show no shame
Wenn ich komme, der weiße Ritter
Lecke meinen Arsch, du Mutterficker!
Fight, fight, translate, kämpf, kämpf, kämpf
I ignite fright night fake sense get tense
Not white hype rhyme tight master suspense
Ich bin Meister des Engineerens, Meuterei
Fick die amerikanische Polizei
Die hard bitch yippee ki-yay Schweinebacke
Mach ihn tot, fick die schmutzige Ratte
Stopping the system, stomping the opposition maybe they not gonna listen
I stay be dropping the wisdom, this is an unpopular position
Break laws in Deutsch, alle brechen das Gesetz
Pop in your Maxell or Memorex cassette decks go

Glaubt ihr an die wahre Liebe?
Glaubt ihr wirklich, die Wichser rappen noch wenn sie keine Gage kriegen?

Kool Whip,"Now
All my life I've waited
And I've been afraid and
I wondered If I'd find
Someone to share my life

Every day I prayed and
Every night I searched in
Every stranger's eyes
For some kind of sign

Me and my heart wishin' in the dark
Tryin' to believe in a sky full of stars
I was waiting for you 
A million empty days, too much time and space
Every tear I cried, every lonely night 
I was waiting for you

Now here you are
And my world is, my world is so beautiful
Now here you are
And my life is, and my life is so wonderful
Now

The past seems like a dream
Just vacancy
How did I exist before our first kiss
Oh I feel so lucky because I know you
Love me
And no one ever has, like no one ever has

Me and my heart wishin' in the dark
Tryin' to believe in a sky full of stars

N blocks a coptic smile
She got the understated
She got the car crash hands
She got my size ten meathooks
They hide a gangees tongue
She knows the lawless shan lands
She walks a modal mile
I stay sub-merged for two days
I may go back for three
I'm backing off till morning
To follow bassline leads
I'm standing still on 10th street
I'm not the only one
I want this night to stretch us
There's plenty left to know
I walked a million marchers
And i got million hands
It's all just blistered slipstream
It's all just space to run
I pull the budda hamstring
I'm looking homer tides
I clean the pipe hea scrapings
I'm not the only one
The street breath is upon me
We walk the river miles
The ageless cities waiting
In gospell bus stop eyes
You're asking more than reason
She ransom freestyle flow
She not the only one
I'm not the only one
She wait with dread upon her
She wait butnot for i

It just won't trust me still

I know there's more to tell

And the doers keep on doin it to me

And I just had to tell you
I just had to make sure everyone knows
They're fighting in the streets again
Still trying to save their souls

And were supposed to be human
We're supposed to have figured out the world
And found something we can believe in
At least that's what I have heard

So keep on pilin your money
Pile it up to the sky
Then you can climb it to Jesus
You know he loves a man that tries

So come on darlin take shelter
I see that moon on the rise
Salvation's for sale and hates the currency that buys

And the watchers keep on watchin
And the doers keep on doin it to me

And found something we can believe in
At least that's what I have heard

Well they say it's just the way things go
But I know that love will grow
And sometimes it goes the other way too

And I can see into my brothers heart
I can see beneath his skin so dark
I can see that he's the same as me
I can see that when you cut he bleeds

Can't you see that when you cut we bleed
Can't you see that when you cut we bleed

As you boast about the things that you haven't done.
Oh joy, the thrills, this is fun.
Down the hallways I still remember
The things you said.
And I hang my head low.
And I try not to feel.

Les gars c’est des pervers pour les sluts et la chair fraîche
Donne-moi une scène, un mic pis j’les rock comme les White Stripes
Tu veux faire une scène, mes boys te cognent pis c’est bye bye
J’ai les neurones brûlés par ma connexion Wi-Fi
Next step dans ma carrière c’est faire d’la porn avec Mic Life
Dire qu’on est broke c’est la mode, j’pop des doses de Gravol
White JF Harrison avec des hoes de quatorze
T’es pas capable de saisir un mot que j’te cause sur l’album
Jamais sobre, 24/7 sur la Colt et la Bud

J’ai jamais faussé la note, j’pourrais battle Loes pis Drama
J’vois most qui radote, mais j’suis l’seul à rocker Osheaga
J’t’ais posté là-bas ek du monde qui pensent qu’la coke c’est glamour
Avec ma Goldschläger, gros swagger, polo Lacoste 
Classy comme un Floridien bronzé à Boca Raton
Grosse manœuvre pour aller promote le solo album

Jamais rentré dans un Benz sauf au dealership
Aux danseuses à chaque semaine sur mon Dilla shit
Korey Lemay-Thivierge en chute libre d’un édifice
Degenerate mon bitterness, j’suis rendu sick of it

Vas-y puff des blunts comme un collégien, dis au prof qui connaît rien
Sans la drogue c’est poche de déconner sobre

Fais quelque chose de constructif boy, quit le rap
J’le sais qu’on est la voix des pauvres, pas des aristocrates
Philosophe de fin de semaine avec tes critiques sociales
J’veux cracher en l’air qu’ça vous atterrisse dans face
On veut envoyer chier la terre pis après split le cash
Quand j’frappe les bars appelle-moi Korey Winehouse
Étendu sur le sol mort, sorry I’m out

Les dudes de Limoilou qui boivent leur 12 à tous les jours
Qui ont trouvé l'amour et prennent leur cousine cute pour épouse
Mes boys paresseux qui utilisent encore Fruity Loops
Les transgenres qui voudraient des boobs sous leur blouse
Ceux qui dorment dans le satin blanc comme Moody Blues
Ceux qui dorment dans les parcs s’é bancs et vivent juste pour être saouls
Ceux qui se servent de leur femme pour pratiquer leur jiu-jitsu
Les Texans qui roulent dans des Hummer Jeeps bulletproof
Tous des fous, j’suis le seul à voir que le monde est mad
J’me suis trompé de planète, j’voudrais bouger avec ma blonde sur Mars
Me mettre des souliers de béton pis couler dans le fond d’un lac
Ou aller dépenser mon compte épargne sur des onces de Jack
J’ai l’impression qu’une balle m’apporterait un calme immense
Ça doit être pour ça qu’on dit « appuyer sur la détente »

J'étais à l'écart de tous mes amis d'enfance
Chasing dreams, essayant de toucher mes rêves
Sans même avoir un oreiller où j'pouvais me coucher la tête
J'étais dans une autre vie, dans un autre monde
Dans une autre ville, un autre lit avec une autre blonde
J'étais entassé dans un trou, cassé comme un clou
Avec à peine un billet de 20 qui traîne pour aller prendre un coup
J'étais saoul fini, couché dans les toilettes du bar 
Les pensées black comme ma Guinness parce que je broyais du noir
Avec les jobs qui se font rares et le loyer qui part

T'étais su'l bord de la noyade, le visage dans l'eau

J'étais un enfant de l'asphalte pris dans un appart de banlieue
Toi tu faisais ton babyshower dans un afterhour
J'étais loin des jours de classe et des corridors
Perdant mon âme dans le floss et le money talk
J'étais loin des carrés de sable dans un shot de fort
L'amour est mort, on party hard dans un corbillard
J'ai des mémoires de toi qui cours près des ballons-poires
Maintenant c'est juste le vent qui souffle sur ta balançoire
J'étais quelque part en train de me saouler that night
Pendant que tu cherchais ta vie en dessous des blacklights

J'étais dans un char, sur un vélo
Dans un bus, ou un métro, dans un block, dans un ghetto
Je prenais des puffs sur un mégot, les menottes comme un étau pour une job pis un payroll
Je mélangeais le scotch pis les verres d'eau
Sur la brosse quand j'me levais tôt pour un boss pis un payroll
J'voulais la gloire comme un héros
Aller voir si y'a de l'or quelque part over the rainbow
Notre enfance qui meurt sous les bombes
Dans la peur et les pleurs et la honte
Sur le phone c'est ma sœur qui l'annonce
Pendant que s'arrêtaient les heures sur ta montre

Seul avec moi-même c'est le seul moyen d'me clear le mind
J'pourrais partir en mer, essayer de rider sur un tide
J'pourrais partir en l'air, j'aime mieux garder mes pieds sur terre
Drive slow homie, fais pas du drift l'hiver
Au pire j'vais rapper through the wire dans un fil de fer
Slide sur la black ice, crash d'un camion qui déneige

Si j'suis gone dans mon char avec une pile de 100 dollars
Attends-moi pas ce soir parce que j'risque de rentrer tard
J'drive à 160, un 40 ounce dans l'entrejambe
Sache que j'tais dans l'tort si jamais j'rentrais dans le décor

J'vais peut-être prendre de l'âge avant le soir du grand départ
Ou me faire shot down dans la tempe pendant que j'rob une banque

Shades dans la face quand le soleil se couche

Quitte l'équipe, t'es malhabile, t'as pas le dribble, t'as pas les shots
T'as les bars pis t'as la voix, mais t'as pas le corps, t'as pas la face
T'es tu hard ou t'es tu soft, Montréal-Nord ou St-Eustache?
As-tu blow up, fais-tu du cash, as-tu une job, vis-tu du rap?
As-tu encore le même spot, le même char, le même appart?
T’es-tu fidèle à 100 %, aimes-tu ta femme pis des enfants?
T'es pu pareil, t'es pu le même, pourquoi tu rappes pu comme avant?
T'écris tes textes, tu fais tes beats, mais t'as pas de cred, t'es pas dans l'street
T'as pas la plume de Militari ni les beats de Dead Obies
T'as des amis, c'est qui ta clique, comment t'a vit ta vie d'artiste?
As-tu fini de dire que t'es triste, as-tu guéri tes cicatrices?
T’es-tu à gauche ou ben à drette, es-tu pauvre, as-tu des dettes?
Prends-tu d'la dope ou des meds, as-tu d'la coke dans les veines?
Pis j'veux le savoir, as-tu des secrets dans ton crâne, as-tu des squelettes dans le placard?
Vas-tu partir avec des regrets à ta mort?

Kid yourself until
Something feels different, but even
Down to your last breath
Can the worst bring out your best
Fake it 'till you make 
A name out of yourself again
Step up what is left of your game

À la recherche du Love Suprême, quête d'amour et de gloire
J'ai toujours porté les remords comme un tattoo sur le corps
J'ai fait les affaires comme un God mais fait un pacte avec le diable
Jamais camouflé mes flaws et toujours avoué mes torts
Y'a des amitiés qui cassent, les vieux amis prennent le bord
La minute où t'as le crown, tu vois la jalousie qui sort
Toujours battu pour le love, les shots partent de tous les bords
Mais protéger les proches ce sera à la vie à la mort
J'voulais juste ride avec les buddys, getting high, faire des folies
Living life, getting money, être le maître de cérémonie
Biting into life, j'en ai de la chair sur les canines
Avec les deux yeux sur le prize pour le rêve que j'imagine
What's life after death pour un white rapper queb
Pas de secondaire et pas de cégep, tu laisses la wife avec les dettes
La tête dans le ciel, l'envie de fly avec les jets
J'veux crier « j'vais jamais perdre », pas chanter l'air de la défaite

[Sabrina Halde:]
Write down your last will
Don't keep it all in
So your glory still can live 
Build a monument
Your body can rest as long as
No one forgets

Kid yourself until
Something feels different, but even
Down to your last breath
Can the worst bring out your best
Fake it 'till you make 
A name out of yourself again
Step up what is left of your game

Jamais voulu d'un nine to five, j'étais comme « work c'est pour les losers »
Les yeux fixés sur le rêve même si tout l'monde autour est douteux
Tout pour me sentir alive, j'bois mes coups durs dans mes shooters
Devant la foule getting high ou sous les couvertes juste nous deux
Grain de sable dans le désert ou goutte de pluie dans l'océan
J'veux laisser quelque chose derrière comme un bruit dans le néant
Qu'on se souvienne que j'étais une bête, j'étais un héros, j'étais une légende
Un air qui joue dans ta tête parce que ton cerveau c'est mon playground
Mais c'est pas c'que je voulais être, j'ai vendu mon âme pour une place
En dessous des spotlights, j'ai blanchi mes dents pour les flashs
Pour entrer dans la légende, j'en aurais vendu ma mère
J'voulais déranger les gens, pas entrer dans le ventre de la bête
Mettre une étampe sur le temps, mettre de l'essence sur la braise
J'ai perdu qui je suis vraiment pendant ma descente aux enfers
Criez mon nom pour le monde, répandez mes cendres dans la mer
Parce que ce soir le Roi est mort, enlevez le crown sur ma tête

I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Why did you tease me? Made me feel upset
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly.
Please just go away
I can see inside you fine
This blessing in disguise
Why you treat me this way?
Make the hate stay
A cell locked, I can never see no escape
All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably.
You'd just go on your way
Fagot!

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it
It keeps going on day after day, son
You fake, if you don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday
Who gives a fuck right now I got something to say to all the people
That think

I'm strange and I should be out of here locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty-boy feeling like I'm enslaved to a world that
Never appreciated shit
You can suck my dick and fucking like it!
Hear my gun, but he has a body mighty

Any say, anyway, going to say, anyway, any say,
Going away, going to say, anyway
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world
All my life, who am I?!

trying to find some kind of inner link.

And what did I see?
A fat little red fagget
Hangin' from a tree

He stuffed the stockings
With reefers and beer
And a big fat hairy dick
For the family queer

That's the end of my story
Funny wasn't it, ya see?

She didn't even
She didn't see my thing behind ya
Leave ya for this private eye
I was there to give 'em near to my
Zima zima mommy fah

I'm gonna say this
Hope it don't offend ya
Came to the grizma
Give 'em a taste of me
Give 'em a little excitement to the damn monkey
Your monkey can stay with me
Ahh, ahh, ahh

Chevy took my brain
Same old motherfucker, sucked my dick that day
He will never zima zima
Never, never not that day

I'm really sick of all this excitement
Yeah, but he thinks he's better than me

You can suck my dick all day
One, two, three, four
Santa can suck my dick all day

When they get it in the way, not by my side
So I'll take my face and bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain

This pain is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again

My hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far
All this time I've been waiting
Oh I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and
Oh I cannot give anymore

My mind's done with this
Okay, I've got a question
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine
So I'll take my time
Driving humbly down the line
Each cut, closer to the vein

This pain is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again

I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and

Bring it down !
Gonna bring it down
Gonna break it down

What is it that I've become?
Is there something more to come? (more to come)

Now I see the times they change
Leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find
Where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take
All alone I seem to break

Korn,"Yo pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too
We're about to go down and you know just what to do

Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick mamma
Come on baby tell me what's the word

Word up, everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up, it's the code word
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools

If there's music we can use it be free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me mamma

Go past the school the church the places that
Caused us and we're gone
If we keep going forward maybe forget where weÂ´re from

Yes it's me again
I only ask for everything
Yes it's me again

I smash it to fuel this need

Whatever sickness you feed

Y'all dumb suckers can't take the heat
Your blood rushing from head to feet
This is what I stand for

I'm the living proof that you can
Turn around and say ""it's me again""

Korn,"Put your hand against your skin
Rub it gently to begin
You feel it
Can you feel it?
When does pleasure become pain?
When does sex become insane?
You say it
As you feel it

When you come (be a good girl)
Hold your breath (make it last long)
It's a mess, and it's called, The little death girl.

So please
When you die could you scream?
Mercy, mercy for you and me.
It's true
What they say, fucking for love
Love might be the last legal drug
So please
When you cry let if flow
I might
Make you stay, let you go
It's true
What they say, fuck it boy
Love might be the last legal drug

Push that one more time that's all
And the rain begins to fall
You feel it
Can you feel it?

Telling you that it's a sin
You say yes
As you feel it

2 I love your pain

4 is for the torture and
5 is for the shame
'cause ever time you want it I get off on this game

You wanted to play the coldness follows
This isn't a game your life full swallow
And I can't help to smile at your pain
You wanted to play but I already won

I look at you and start to crack start to crack
I give it to you take it back, take it back
This lullaby is all you have, all you have
Sadistic pleasure I attack, I attack
I attack

It’s almost over

Across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now

I won’t stop fighting
Bring it on, it wont phase me
Any time it makes me stronger

My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance

If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Tell him to just get out,

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

If you've reached the end, 
Don't pretend that is right when it's over

(it's over)
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over

There was a girl wantin' bliss
She was ready to go
Things here simply
Moved too slow - 
Moved too slow

She thought this was a one horse town
She'd save herself from it anyhow
Sittin' there day in day out
Made her wanna scream and shout out loud

She was workin' on a scheme
That would jumpstart her dreams
And then one sunny day
He came and took her breath away
Hey hey

Lean as a tree 
His shadow stretched across the street
He wore a charmer's smile
He always went that extra mile - 
Extra mile

He was an old-fashioned guy
These modern times came as a big surprise
They were gonna tear him down
They were gonna knock him around

They can live a lover's tale
They have no intention of failing",One Sunny Day

Oh no, here we go
Kottonmouth Kings about to blow
All because the way we roll

Now 10 years later

But the love is overwhelming
Let me put it this way

Ima baller punk pimp; I'm a rollin' stone
Bonafide born mack

Got an underground palace with a custom made throne
Got my own fuckin' song on my cellular phone
So just leave a message 'cause I'm never home

(Chorus)
So many years in this game and we still strong
So many haters that we had to prove dead wrong
You talking shit you little bitch you want to bring it, bring it on
You play with BB guns we drop atomic bombs
Save your breath you cowards

Workin' nine to fivers
Hate us 'cause we live this way

(D-LOC)
Sick of all these fools talking shit
Eat a dick, you need to grow up like a man, bitch
You actin like a chick

You got no home

I do, I do what I really want to do
I bust it so much its you all know who
Who gonna want to test the master D
I'm gonna get you all to stop and see

Pants sag, brown hair, no care no sing

In the end it will diminish

Kottonmouth Kings,"My mission: the commission of the dishin' out for facts
'cause when I'm dimin' my rhymin' never slacks, never lacks
So get back to the basics and face it. 
The American dream ain't what it seems
With lies they've laced it. 
Can't you taste it? 
See they baste it in an imitation butter. 
We've ate it and realized its not nature to mother
Generic like no other, man, fuck big brotha! 

The Kottonmouth King klick. Are you blind or somethin'? 
Are you blind to the facts? You think that this system, 
That this society, sees any other color other than green? 
Well it's all slave-driven. The illusion of ownership in America
Property is theft, that's how we livin'

The bong tokin' alcoholics 
Gettin' bent every night is the thing we do
Wakin' up every day in the afternoon. 
I crawl out the bed on the way to the shower
Gotta hurry up I got a date in an hour. 
Call my boy X on the shower phone. 
""What's up, Saint? Man, I'm stoned alone
By the way I got the freaks on point
Call up the krew, hook it up. Lata."" 
I hung up with X and gave my boys a holla. 
D-loc picked up said ""What's up balla?"" 
Just droppin' a dime and time about this party 
There'll be a lotta beer and some naughty hotties
I'll call Bobby let him know the plan, 
And we'll bounce through in the nitrate van. 
We'll take a road trip, 40-sip on the way
Oh yeah X commin' through with some freaks from the Bay

Bong tokin' alcoholics, the Kottonmouth tilt is what we call it, 
The bong tokin' alcoholics, step back I'm bout to crack 
Legalize it!
The bong tokin' alcoholics (repeat)

We drank up a fifth and sparked a bowl
Humble Gods on the radio bumpin' real low. 
I reach into the back and pull out the 64, 
I took it to the head like a motherfuckin' pro
Yo, that drink got me on tilt, 
Ya better sit down 'cause you about to spill
Now we approach up on the corner of the house party 
I'm down, I'm told?
Conversation with the krew, I thought you knew to pass the brew 
Tasted kinda freaked, Saint your ass is through 
Break out the beer bong man, I want to get faded
'cause drinkin' out the bottle is just so overrated, 
We got the 22, we're fillin' up on Mickeys 
Now what's up you drunk bitch? You spillin' on my Dickies 
Well boost up the bass, go easy on the treble 
And let 'em all know that we some psycho rebels 
With our pants saggin', skates in our hand 
With our pants saggin', skates in our hand
With our pants saggin', skates in our hand
Now we're rollin' 3 deep and we don't give a damn

Legalize it!

I got the blunts and I got the beer 
Daddy X hits skins in the rear view mirror
We walked up to the spot, the keg's our destination 
'cause runnin' local parties is a nightly occupation 
I went to get a beer, felt a finger in my back
""Hey I like your shirt"", yeah I see it is quite phat 
But no time to mack 'cause Saint's drunk as hell
He was standin' on the table and he started to yell, 
""All the freaks up in the party, move around and shake your body 
And if you're down with the boys of P-Town 
Lemme see somebody get naughty. 
Is the west coast in the house? 
Then pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!""
Well get naughty they did and these girls start to strip, 
Started freakin' on my shit and her boyfriend tried to trip 
I said ""You talk shit, punk? Let's step outside"" 
He put his fists up, I put em on his eye
He got a left to the cheek, skateboard to the dome,
I busted out the ? and took his girlie home

Kottonmouth Kings,"(Intro):
Creep, creep, I'm on the creep
The creep for the kind bud
O.C. late night, rolling in the v-dub
Sick of scraping resin so I'm looking for a sack
All I learn, I'll head for burn
BSO's got my back
Right on, right on brother, blaze on
You better rip that shit, rip it
It's that 1605 shit, real hunnington beats
Backyard fucking, garage style

(Chorus):
Bump, bump, bump
That's the sound of the fifteens while they're hitting in my trunk
Said bump, bump, bump
We're the Kottonmouth Kings and we don't give a fuck

(Verse) Saint Dog:
Well I'm that kid that the bitches talk about
Saint's what they shout, you got all the clout
A day in the life of a Kottonmouth King, 1605 (fool pass me the thing)
Now the stereo is off, I sway, push play
You hear humble gods from a mile away
All the heads are bobbing because the base is bumping
D-Loc is mumbling, (I got a little something)
Well he passed me a hornet and I took a sip
Sparked up a bowl and I took a rip, trip
Came to halt at an intersection
Turned up the music at my discretion
D-Loc in the back said what do I see
A jeep full of freaks just staring at me
D-Loc was right, they were in a range rover
Looked over my shoulder, I pulled them all over
They got out the car and stepped to my side
I said, hello ladies let's take a ride
I'm Saint Dog, that's D-Loc the man
Daddy X is the one that's driving the van
So climb on in and don't be shy
We're gonna close the doors and let the games be fly
Once again I said it, my name's ST
It's just another day of a P-T-be	
Come on, come on

(Chorus)x2

Saint Dog putting it down for suburban pride

(Verse) Saint Dog:
I was living my life on a nine to five
Up early in the morning trying to survive
Chump change, it's a shame, with no education
No inspiration, no destination,
But now my occupation is to do what I like
Keep the crowd moving and rock the mic
Because if I don't rock it, then another sucker will
And if you don't jock it, then I can't pay the bills
Trick Daddy X threw me out on stage
Said Saint, represent for the underage
Same damn year, my face is up and raised
Got that ring in my nose labeled sixteen gauge

D-Loc:
No Saint dog, I hunt ducks with a twelve gauge
And when I'm on the stage, yes I get get real blazed
Get me on the court my skills will put you in a maze
T-T-T-twicking a twine all day
Come on, come on

(Chorus)x3

D-Loc's on the mic, rip rip shit up

(Verse) D-Loc:
It's the unpolitical, psychoanalytical,
Undefeated Champ that will stick you fool
My style is crazy, not wooka wakka lazy
If you chill with me I'll be sure to (blaze thee)
Plant you in the ground, let you drift like a daisy
That shit's in my system makes my life kind of hazy
My momma, my poppa, I think I should tell them
The J gots my head, and fucked up my cerebellum
It's about time to compute your math
Because my beats keep bumping like a seismograph
See I've tripped before, but never like this
Straight to my mind, put my brain in a bliss
I won't fake the funk, when I'm smoking on a skunk
That forty bowl evil got my peacock drunk
And like Micky Mantle, I can switch my stance
I'm a supercharged baller that's electrically enhanced
My flows are silky soft, like I'm writing them in lotion
And I'm a lyricist, that's poetry in motion
To each town, to each house, I cause mass commmotion
?????? take it all for my potion
Farewell to all and to all goodnight
I'm leaving these ??? out all night
Wait wait wait you said ??? that shit will suck you up
Get off the ??? and rock the bump
Come on

(Chorus)x1

Kottonmouth Kings,"I said my momma don't understand me, Daddy never really cared
Fuck the rest, I've failed their test
I guess life just ain't fair
A preacher man done told me, said your ways you better change
But forgive me man, I got a mic in my hand
And it's my time to rock the stage, misunderstood

One in a million, a million in one
A stoner reeking havoc, but I don't carry a gun
Only a microphones so I can rock the stage
Don't got a beeper But I got some pages of some dope ass lyrics
From my imagination
Smoked out the officer on my probation
Bustin caps in the balls of this generation
I flip this phat verse with no hesitation
My bro Mad Dog, the south bay psycho, got the bong and bud
(?) everlasting cycle, the dates (?) don't get no sweeter
My boy be	-Dub ain't a mother fucka tweaka
He's a ganja man, that's the way it goes
2 turntables always rockin' shows
Hey Bobby be	, how does your bud grow?
Shhh....That's on the down low

I said my momma don't understand me, Daddy never really cared
Fuck the rest, I've failed their test

But forgive me man, I got a mic in my hand
And it's my time to rock the stage, misunderstood

Kottonmouth komittee made of horny devils, psycho rebels
Bitch turn up the treble
We want to be heard 'cause we speak the truth
Yo we miss Rob Harris in the DJ booth
And that's the truth, 'cause that's the roots
We miss Rob Harris in the DJ booth
Yo all I'm sayin' kid is the freedom of speech
A freedom to blaze, a freedom to reach
New plateaus are a high away
2 joints in the morning then I'm A-OK
I smoke two joints in the morning
Get the vodka then I mix the OJ, okay

I said my momma don't understand me, Daddy never really cared
Fuck the rest, I've failed their test

A preacher man done told me, said your ways you better change

And it's my time to rock the stage, misunderstood

I'm D-Loc I puff all the smoke
Never have herbs 'cause I'm always broke
Never had a job, probably never will
That's right Saint Dog, we kings of the hill
I'm Saint Dog never find me trippin'
Never gun grippin', always 40 sippin'
Anarchy is the life of me, give me booze, blunts, broads
And I'll tap all three
I got a German glow with an irie flow
You're red in the face 'cause I bucked your hoe
So what now bro? You know we told ya so
We got more game that L.A.'s got blow
Yo my boy D-Loc got ears like a monkey
My boy Saint Dog is a hip-hop drunkie
DJ Bobby be	 gots the tracks that are funky
If you really must know I grow my green bud skunky

I said my momma don't understand me, Daddy never really cared

Kottonmouth Kings,"Kottonmouth Kings don't stand for a gang
Kottonmouth Kings just let the nuts hang
Everyday thing how we hang, how we hang
Kottonmouth Kings just do their own thing

This the type of thing that we be doin' everyday
Didi dodi didi dodi didi dodi day
Make some room so these players can play
So we can play on, play on

Now I woke up this morning and I thought about Hoss
Smoked a cigarette and I chucked my dirty drawers
Threw on some Dickies and I grabbed my back chain
Slapped it down my waist and I let my pants hang
Beanie on my head just to cover up my lump
The night before got in a fight just cause I was drunk
Grabbed my sack of weed and I loaded up the bong
Took a rip held it in then I coughed up a lung
Burn some incense so I can cover up the smell
An everyday thing that I live to tell
Pulled out my Black Flys, covered up my red eyes
If that copper pulls me over well its lies, lies, lies
Dirty copper, dirty copper, dirty copper

Now the stereo is on and the CD was bumpin'
Insane Clown Posse talkin' bout chicken huntin'
Walked up to the fridge, opened it up and grabbed my brew
Picked up the phone dialed my pimp and called the crew
Party later on, over by river jetties
56th Street so you know there'll be some betties
Pacific Coast Highway takes me to my destination
Party time baby, its a nightly occupation
Stepped out the pad, walked in the player's den
On the way mail a letter to my brother in the pen
There's a smile on your face from my smooth dub style
See you later alligator, after a while crocodile

Now a new day dawned, lets get things started
Hit the bong, wrote a song, took a piss and farted
Dip my blue jeans in some bleach and starches
Mobbin' OC we need the golden arches
D-Loc where you at?
Saint's hung over and he started to yack
Kicked out of Mickey D's 'cause we don't know how to act
Lets call up Kevin Zinger hook a forty sack
Now tonight's the night like DJ Quik
At least 3 parties that we gotta hit
And if the cops show up were gonna start some shit
Riot time baby-Kottonmouth Klick
Punk rock music homegrown in OC
Adolescents, Doggy Style, DI and Social D
No Doubt, Agent Orange now the PTB
The last generation of the dynasty
Now the skates in the sack lets hit the ditch
Broke up with my girlie cause the ho was a bitch
Still that boy that be puttin' it down
Representin' OC, P-Town

This the type of thing that we be doin' everyday
Didi dodi didi dodi didi dodi day
Make some room so these players can play
So we can play on play on

Brought the 77 slant nose V-dub Bug
Leaks oil but the roads (?)called it crazy (mug?)
Its a little noisy but inside its all good
Got two 15's underneath the hood
Well I was rollin' down Yorba Linda Blvd.
Got the neighborhoods bumpin', tainted hard
Dodgin' and weavin' down suburban streets
Till this one house wife started bitchin' at me
So I pulled the bug over and I revved it up
First gear lit em up, then I backed it up
Over the curb, told her to kiss my ass
Gave her the bird, boned out on that ass
Back on the mission to score a sack
77 boned out passed the Cadillac
Heard a horn honk it was full of freaks
Ladies on my tip cause I'm so unique
Turn the bass high and I tilted my lid
I'm used to gettin' jocked, I'm that P-Town kid
And you know I'm doin' shit that you wish you did
Dip right goin' 30 around the corner I slid
Stopped at the school jumped on my skate
4 freaks showed up, one I use to date
They broke out the blunt and they got me stoned
Another day gone, so long, so long

This the type of thing that we be doin' everyday
Didi dodi didi dodi day
Make some room so these players can play
So we can play on, play on

(We don't let them know?) that we smoke out everyday
Didi dodi didi dodi day
Bring a fat sack so the homies can blaze
So we can blaze on, blaze on

Didi dodi didi dodi day

Attention young ladies, attention young ladies
Man homeboy's over here in the garage with 4 1000's
Powder nutrients growing in the dirt
Takin' 4 and a half months not even getting a full peak
Ya know, ya know, ya know.
In a room the size of a telephone booth
Using liquid nutrients, (buds swell rock, wool?)
One 1000 watt high pressure sodium
(kevorki?) buds the size of a fuckin' Volkswagen,
Ya know what I'm talkin' about, you do the math motherfucker.
What's up smokers?
Another suburban noize joint for you to pull on
Stoners Reeking Havoc

I'ma get you so high, I'ma make that ass fly.
Hit the bong, stand by
I'ma get you so high

Back up off me, I need room to puff
Fuck Babylon, man I can't get enough
I smoke, so I like it going down
We're all getting lifted 'cause I just stole a pound
Two hits and pass, that's what Saint's yellin
Fuck that shit, I'm hittin till my mind's jelly
And when I'm done, I'll head to Flannagan's
To play some pool and that's with a couple friends

Grab a sack, it's off to a local park
Break out the bong, pack it tight and let it spark
Windows up so the bug's gettin fishbowled
And if you're in you can't escape the indo
Oh shit, it's gettin deep into my mind
I took 7 hits off that bud called kind
Close my eyes, my mind starts joggin
Here I go again, man, my mind's boggling

I'ma get you so high, mind boggling
I'ma make that ass fly, mind boggling
Hit the bong stand by, mind boggling
I'ma get you so high

Here I go reminiscing about the weekend
Takin time to remember where my shit has been
Dinner to dancing, fly girl romancing
Ballin with the homies, smoking buds and relaxin
(?) that shit is how I was smoking
Fuck this schwag weed, indo is what I'm tokin
Splif to my lips as I tilt my head back
Lookin like a mack 'cause I'm down to blaze a sack
I said inhale, exhale, kottonmouth hits so I said 'that's swell'
Pass a tweak to the left, party busters set in
I need some fresh air 'cause I'm high off that in
Walked towards the door but man I didn't get far
High kicked in, I took a seat at the bar
As I look into the sky and the air starts fogging
Here I go again, yo my mind's boggling

I'ma get you so high, mind boggling
I'ma make that ass fly, mind boggling
Hit the bong stand by, mind boggling
I'ma get you so high

Here I go getting deeper into my mind again
Thinking bout good times, smoking kind again
By myself so you say, am I a stoner or a loner
Man I can't cope with this lil hell that I'm livin in
I got family members fiending from the cocaine
And loved ones locked up in prison
That's why I'm bailin' ya'll, man fuck the system!
all the pressures of this life get me frustrated
So I reach for the bong so I can get faded
I blaze a bowl and it take me to another level
To escape the pain and all my life's trouble
Close my eyes, pray take the pain away
Ask the lord should I live to see another day
Rob Harris died, I guess this is one of life's little tests
...take a bullet to the chest

died at 23, now she's waitin for me up above

I was there for myself and Big Hoss in the pen 
In this life of sin it takes me gin to get by, no lie
I steady blaze and forever stay high 
Don't try to understand it, this life you can't plan it 
Just don't take it for granted 
Life, to live while you live 

Death, to give what you get 
Pain, the reality of change 
I wonder whether, things will ever get better 
Everyday, there's more pain that comes my way 
And so I pray, the lord to take me away 
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep 
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me 

I picture life as a dream here today gone tomorrow 
Love equals hollow, hate equals sorrow 
Now follow the real as I take you 
To a field in my mind where I journey 
Sucker bitches can't burn me, bring an attorney 
'Cause since child birth 
I've been raised to do dirt on this earth, yes it hurts 
To find out that i can't get away from all the pressures and pain 
And misfortunes that I've gained straight 

Sometimes a fire grows inside, hatred starts to rise
Still i can't despise all the lies I've been told
The secrets they hold 
The government control, man fuck five-O 
So I say, keep your faith in the J
Saint Dog and great smokes a pack a day 
Keep your faith in the J, every day I pray 
Keep your faith in the J, man pass it this way

Everyday, there's more pain that comes my way 
And so I pray, the lord to take me away 
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep 
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me",Everday
Kottonmouth Kings,"These fly rhymes and high times are brought to you by Suburban Noize
D-Loc, Saint Vicious, DJ Bobby be, Pakelika
The bakers man, bake me a cake as fast as you can
Polish up the krown then watch it shine
The Kottonmouth Kings are on the frontline

Fly rhymes, high times
Suburban Noize gotta be on the frontline
Zigzags, chronic sack
Nasty girls been ridin' with some big macks
Kickin verbs, smokin herbs
Just an everyday thing in the the suburbs
Bass high, treble low
Nothin' but some big west-coast juggalos

Now I take ten steps, turn and break out the hoop
Grip the zag tightly 'cause I'm about to shoot
Wind in my ear, the advisory I can see
Voices whisper clear, smoke another ST
So I do, I fire it up, round one round two, now I'm lifted up
Three, four can I stand and handle one more?
I'm in the sky, am I knockin' on heavens door?
Now I loaded up the clip and I pulled it through
And seen the little black hole that said I missed you
I can feel the expansion in my chest
I let go I'm stress free, there's no worries left
On this summer my mind travels as my eyes gloss
I reminisce about the days I hung with Big Hoss
And even though he's locked down man he still knows
That Saint Dog's got a love for his big bro
I gotta go

Goin', goin', gone that's it just blazed my last sack
Case to the head so I can see black
So yo that's that pack me another rip
So I can lay back and let my mind start to trip
By me D-Loc, call me stoner of the crew
If your fuckin' with my stash then I'm fuckin' with you
Saint Dog's got my back, man I thought you knew
Fly rhymes, high times, Suburban Noize comin' through

Fly rhymes, high times
Suburban Noize gotta be on the frontline
Bass high, treble low

Mary Jane, she's my girl
Nowadays seems like the bitch rules my world
And every time our lips meet
She got's me loungin' like a leaf on a bud tree

Now I like to stay high, I got the old-school ride
77' bug and it's white on the outside
But on the inside its full of bitches
An ounce of herb, and seventeen switches

Who's that drunk that slurs and spits? (Saint)
Who gets trashed and likes to talk some shit? (Saint)
Get me on a skate and I bust a heel flip
Man I speak with dirt slang and I just can't quit it

Well I'm D Loc-er, the late night toker
Royal flush, got you bluffin' like a game of poker
Sick sick, stylee, face is always smiley
I like to get high and live the life O' Riley

The sick fly still high dope style flow
When my clock strikes 12 ask me where I'm gonna go

Well I'm D-Loc steady blazin' grass
Smokin' funky green buds outta transparent glass
If I hand you a 20 then my sack you pass
If it comes up short I'm gonna bust that ass

Saint Dog, I'm the hog I'm the leader of the krew
Stunt man hittin' hard on the avenue
Or is it all because I drank too many brews?
Porn star lifestyle, so I said FUCK YOU!

I got 2 skateboards, I eat hash and spam
My uncle, my pops, they got it easy man
I got a girl that's down, I call her tikki doll
I like to get high and play dunk ball
I like to get high, ain't a punk y'all
Kottonmouth's in the house, so pack ya bowls
We ain't nothin' but some big west coast juggalos!

Broke out the herb and we rolled a couple joints,

Here I go my mind starts jogging
And I know I shouldn't have been hogging, that indo,
I know everything's fogging
Its just another case of a man mind boggling

Back up off me, I need rooms to puff
Its saint dog, and I cant get enough
Rough, I smoke, so I like it going down
Were all getting lifted cause I just stole a pound
Two hits and pass, that's what saints yelling
But fuck that shit, I'm hitting till my minds jelling
And when I'm done, Ill head to flannagans
To play some pool and max with a couple friends
Grabbed a sack, its off to a local park
Break out the bong, pack it tight and let it spark
Windows up so the bugs getting fish bowled
And if you're in you cant escape the indo
Oh shit, its getting deep into my mind
I took seven hits off that bud called kind
Close my eyes, my mind starts jogging
Here I go again, man, I'm mind boggling

[Chorus]
I'ma get you so high,
I'ma make that ass fly,
Pack up the bong stand by,
I'ma get you so high

[Bridge]
Here I go my mind starts jogging
And I know I shouldn't have been hogging, that indo,
I know everything's fogging
Its just another case of a man mind boggling

Here I go reminiscing about the weekend
Taking time to remember where my shit has been
Dinner to dancing, fly girl romancing
Balling with the homies, smoking buds and relaxing
High fashion, is how I was smoking
Fuck the schwag weed, indo is what I'm toking
Spliff to my lips as I tilt my head back
Looking like a mack cause I'm down to blaze a sack
I said (inhale, exhale),
Kottonmouth hit so I said, ""that's swell""
Pass a tweak to the left, party buzz's set in
I need some fresh air because I'm high off that in
Walked towards the door but I didn't get far
High kicked in, I took a seat at the bar
As I look into the sky and the air starts smogging
Here I go again kid, Im mind boggling

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Smoke sliffs, and live the life of Riley,
Stay high and be so damn smiley,
For then I wont worry about tomorrow,
Because tomorrow only brings pain and sorrow.

Here I go getting deep into my mind again
Thinking bout good times, smoking kind again
By myself so you say (man your hooked on chronic!)
Am I a stoner or a loner man I cant call,
In this cell-lock realm that I'm living in (dog chains?)
I got family members fiending from the cocaine
And loved ones locked up in prison
That's why I'm bailing, yelling, ""man fuck the system!""
All the pressures of this life get me frustrated
So I reach for the bong so I can get faded
I blaze a bowl hope it takes me to another level
To escape the pain and all my life's trouble
Close my eyes, and pray take the pain away
Ask the lord should I live to see another day

Rob Harris died, I guess that's one of life's little tests
Jason Thirsk took a bullet straight to the fucking chest
Monique Delgado my first real true love
Died at 23, now shes waiting for me up above
I grabbed a pipe, pack it tight, start hogging
Here I go again motherfucker my minds boggling!

[Chorus]

Smoke sliffs, and live the life of Riley,
Stay high and be so damn smiley,
For then I wont worry about tomorrow,
Because tomorrow only brings pain and sorrow.

You know it's time to leave my house, so I slid out the door,
Had this hole in my pocket so my sack hit the floor,
Now this ain't nothing new I've had these jeans for years,
Hopped into my bus and started banging the gears,
Took it on the redline then I slapped into,
Reached in-between my seats and I pulled out another brew,
But now I'm 5-0-2 it ain't the route for me,
So I grab some chicken littles from KFC,

I'ma go to Mickey D's get a burger with some cheese,
Discuss these plans how I'm flippin' these keys,
Capisce, a 'cause a 'cause you don't' know him,

Listen to the tones as they crush your speakers with the little thump,

Well yup I'm still drunk with the humps in the trunk,
You hear the Kottonmouth Kings yellin' out BUMP! BUMP!
I flew through a yellow then I ran a red,
Grabbed a bev saw a cop then hit the clutch and breath,
Knew I had to slow down so I smoked a bowl,
Picked up D-Loc and told him start to roll,

Kottonmouth Kings,"Good evening, This is Los Angelos 

A lonely teenage daydream 
Of things I just might be 
A surreal kind of thinking 
Keeps on drifting in on me 
My twisted body is lifeless 
Not so their twisted minds 
Peace through power their motto 
Power through peace their crime 

Product of our environment (x8) 

Maybe one day they will legalize weed 
In the year TWO ""G"" the planet could be deceased 
We plead to the fleece while we're beggin' on our knees 
In our hometown Cali with bears and green trees 
Birds and the bees, hot sand on the beach 
Shells in the sea and I'm living in peace 
Like a dog on a leash locked up with no key 
I gotta smoke under cover, Motherfuck the police 

Yeah, see the matching hand and they're robbing from the hat 
The laws an illusion to symbolize that 
Putting us in jail for the with us living tax tax 
I can see the wires in the levitating act 
I can hear the lies and they're calling them facts 
I can see the bars and they're lookin all cracked 
I read between the lines but the lines are all crap 
I can feel the knife turning in my back 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

You are a sacred being of light 
Projected into reality for a purpose 
Demand the right to your moment 
In this holographic gift with no rules, no borders 
Except for those who you choose to accept and live by 

Abolish government is nothing to me 
Forget about god, he's not here to see 
We live by a system, a perfect mold 
People perfect people who are poor and old 
Lies were spent on a sad defense 
They said we're lookin for a method in this world ??? 
Presidents are named 
Presidents are labeled highest man on the government table 

America, land of the free 
Free to the power of the people in uniform (x2) 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell 

Society, fuck it! 
I've had enough! 
The system's full of crooks, straight up corrupt 
You look like a decoy bobbing like a duck 
And your money keeps em smokin on a BC Bluff 
You're caught up in the headlights of my V-Dub bus 
TSOL and the Kings about to even things up 
Your birds will take all the air out the sky 
Bring em down to our level 
You can work, can't hide 

Product of our environment (x8) 

A lonely teenage daydream 
Of things I just might be 
A surreal kind of thinking 
Keeps on drifting in on me 
My twisted body is lifeless 
Not so their twisted minds 
Peace through power their motto 
Power through peace their crime 

The government keeps our control over the population 
While the schools teach the kids restricted education 
Murder, Rape, Sex, and Underage prostitution 
They got the war on pot, they got the wrong solution 

I wake and I bake, nowhere to escape 
Livin' life in a tank they invade my space 
Betrayed full of hate while they're shootin all blanks 
Society's lost in a paranoid state 

It's the illusion of ownership, It's take what you can get 
The banks are the loan sharks and everyone's in debt 
And if you get ahead how quickly you forget 
You're hanging from a burning rope without a safety net 
They tax you when you sell 
They tax you when you buy 
They take half when you live 
Then they take half when you die 
These are the lies that they are stating as facts 
I can see the wires of the levitating act 

How would life be if the world smoked weed? 
Guaranteed there'd be peace not greed 
See, it's hell 
Living in a cell 
Legalize the plant only time will tell

I'm glad that I can read 
I'm glad that I can write 
I read their fuckin bullshit 
Every single night 
When off in my head went a little fuckin light 
It told me what was wrong it told me what was right

Issuing the money and they're dollin' out the roles 
Charging what they want to with the money, the control

Kottonmouth Kings,"Wasted away, trapped in their maze
Gotta get out

My punk rock?s dirty, my hip hop?s clean
One side has rust the other triple beam
One side is crazy, phat the other?s pissed
And mean half of me?s got problems
The other lives a dream

Well, I'm bi-polar, I'm confused
Split personality, I don't know which to chose
One side is filthy rich, the other is dirt poor
Count me out a thousand times, I still come back for more

We barely just began but already you're done
Get your ass up off the couch and roll another for fun
'Cause I ain't even begun barely dented my stash
Open your eyes and grab a pipe or else it?s time for you to dash

Where you gonna go when it?s time to dash
Grab your sack, don't forget your cash
Life moves fast gotta chose your path
Live while you live 'cause it might be your last

Watch your back it might be over
Sometimes I feel bi-polar
I get confused I don't know where to go
So I stop, slow the tempo

I ain't got hours in my day to smoke with people like you
Wastin' my minutes like a cell phone that you merely abuse
With crooked views at first, I questioned and these unpaid dues
Confuse me not, no second guessin' session veterans never lose

Grab your pipe 'cause you look confused
Rockin' the mic with your unpaid dues
Life?s a bitch we win or lose
How many people don't got a clue
Don't got a clue gotta figure it out

Kottonmouth Kings will put it in your mouth
Eeh haw, don't feed the donkeys me and my honkeys
Smoke that sonkey
Yer done, go to bed, pipe it, bye

Got nothin'
Got nothing to say

The system is full of sharks, the water?s not that deep
A bunch of dirty sharks are snapping at my sleeve
Their poisoning my weed, I think I'm gonna bleed
And now I'm gonna jump

Well, I'm bi-polar, I'm confused
Split personality, I don't know which to chose
One side is filthy rich, the other is dirt poor
Count me out a thousand times, I still come back for more

Suburbs surprise open your eyes and get a grip on your scene
Realize your life?s alive and not a fairytale dream
Most comfortable with slow flow shows, how I like my things
And never pass a packed bowl, unless you know there's some green

Like whoa, burning to the floor
I'm feelin' faded give me some more
Drank a beer and rolled a splif
I do what I do you suck my dick

If you don't like it I don't give a fuck
I just took a shit and I just threw up
Blow it out your butt and out my throat
I choke and slow the tempo

Going, going, gone just put it out of the park
Another win for home team just put the bite with our bark
Just brought some light to the dark another dot hit the mark
You'll never get your bowl burnin' if you don't got the spark

Pick it back up 'cause you might get piped
Slow your roll, put your shoes on tight
Too much smokin' you might get done
I'm done, nothin' no one

One side throw up
The other side full of love
How many live today, got nothing but a big phat blunt
You're done
Got nothin', got nothing to say
Got nothin'
You're done

Everyday, I do it my way
Live my life my way, but don't care what they say

Dying daze, dying daze
Dying daze, dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze

I'm sick of watchin' birds spill, I'm sick of chasin' dollar bills
I'm sick of systems tryin' to seal my fate
I'd rather taste the sunshine with some endo in my ride
I wanna climb waterfalls all day

I wanna break the open sky with my psychedelic eye
I wanna ride around the world today
And if I never make it home, I know my soul is gonna roam
I'm gonna ride until my dying day

Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze

I've been all around the world from the east to the west
Japan to L.A., I said, ""Damn, take a breath""
Livin' life fast put the rest in the past
Till my dying daze I'll go ridin' to the last

And until my dying days, I'm living life to the fullest
Staring at the ripcord wondering when I should pull it
Thinkin' I wanna stop but no I gotta go faster
Gonna go till I'm broke then throw me out to pasture

Alright Johnny Ric' need to stick to the picture
Knowin' damn well how we flip these scriptures
The beats gonna hit ya, ya feel that vibe
It's a dance hall funk with the punk rock rhyme

So get down to pit 'cause it's gonna explode
Circle gonna blow from the first distant go
Whether hittin' 5th wide or chargin' 12 step
Gaps, that's it when you commit 'cause there's no turning back
That's it when you commit 'cause there's no turning back
That's it when you commit 'cause there's no turning back

I'm sick of systems tryin' to seal my fate

And if I never make it home, I know my soul is gonna roam
I'm gonna ride until my dying day

Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze
Ridin' till my dying daze

Last chance gotta chose a path
Either hit the brakes or give a fist full of gas
Give a last push on hope your pegs on tight
'Cause loose screws won't do in the middle of flight

Naw, get it right doc you know Loc, Loc rocked it
Every time I spit you know it sits in the pocket
We the hot topic like dub for sale
D-Loc and Johnny Richter got it wrapped in the mail

We were sent first class signed sealed and inked
Overnight express with all the free drinks
What'd you really think didn't know bout the team
You know, you wish you would've known we rolled 15 deep

Johnny Ric', Daddy X, Big Pak, and Loc
Dog Boy, Bobby be and Lou Dog's fro
On the road doin' shows with Munchey's clothes
And everybody knows that I spit these flows
Everybody knows that I spit these flows

Kottonmouth Kings,"Hey hit this motherfucker
Hit that shit, hit that bitch
It's 4:20.. 
We got love.. 
Is this motherfucker on?

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Chronic sticks in the door
Visions of bongs being burned
D-loc just call me a stoner

A paranoid smoker with my finger on my poker
People puffin stress ain't living right
But I ain't going out without my pipe
See every time I pull a load, I start sweatin, smoke starts coming out my nose

There's somebody slaggin some sacks 
But I don't know who it is so I'm watching my back
It's a cop and he's deep undercover
When I toke I won't see the motherfuckers

[Unknown] Caddy like our own 
A sack of fruit and a bong like my own
Some might say, take a chill D
But fuck that shit there's a pig trying to diss me

I popped in the rip of my indo
Every 20 seconds I be smoking another bowl
Investigating joints for traps
Checkin my herb for a branch

I'm staring at my girl on the corner
It's fucked up when my mind's playing tricks on her 

I got a big afro
I drive old cars
Ain't nobody roll like me
It's like I'm a movie star

But late at night something ain't right
Somebody's coming in and they taking all my grow lights
Is it that dude tryin' to steal all my crops
Or could it be the one that sold the hydroponic rocks

Or is it that one claimin' he had the power
Tryin' to grow herb but it was hemp pure and flower
Reach under my seat grabbed
[Unknown] ain't no use to me [Unknown]

They were ? than a motherfucker
Transplant complete and I told them all 65 days and that shit will be done with
Ounce nugs just like I figured
Cannabis cup, kings blend is the winner

And what I saw make your head start wrigglin
Three rip cripplin stoney senior citizens
I live by the bud
I take my clones everywhere I go because I'm paranoid

I keep looking over my shoulder, peeping around corners
My mind's playing tricks on me

Day by day its more impossible to cope
Daddy X smokin off pounds of dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Slanging buds, got a door to door service

Knee deep in the motherfuckin business
Cold hearted with no room for forgiveness
I got ? about 3 in each ? prop 215 fuckin me down in O.C.
The punk claimed that he knew Johnny Richter

Something about his x girl that he dicked her
I got phat sounds in my ride
Way too many friends that have died
I got a baby girl to look after
I play the role like a motherfuckin actor

Big daddy plant seeds in my wife
Plan on being down for life
Got the baddest bitch in the whole city
With 2 fat big brown big ass titties

And they the types I be suckin on
D-loc come and pack up my zong
My motherfucking sacks' getting lonely
My minds playing tricks on me

I'm feeling high my sacks getting lonely
Goddamn homie, my minds playing tricks on me

This year 420 fell on a weekend
Kottonmouth Kings is trick or treating
Robbin' little kids for sacks
[Unknown] got behind our ass

Broke the fuck out and said late
Skate to my house sucker sittin down by my gate
We were in for a session no doubt
Reached in my pocket you know what I pulled out
The G13 then the zong was delivered

But this battle just called for something bigger
A bong about six or seven feet
A specialty piece I envisioned in my sleep
Pulled out the triple beam on em

Dropping them motherfuckin Gs on em
The more I smoke the more high I grew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like fiend

The shit was brown, man it wasn't even green
I was high as fuck in the street
And to top it all off I broke my zong on the concrete

Check out this kottonmouth king
Too rude for that shit
Dog boy, come inside

In the aftermay of the bed to won
We celebrate, with the rising sun
The summers dry, God got me on the run
And we won't stop, until the war is won

because we strong, like a green breate
Special forces for peace and unity

because we strong, like a green breate
Special forces for peace and unity

Day to day, song by the song the battle rages on
????soul mighty power up my zong
When I think bout home
when I'm wonderin' why
How'd I end upon this road
It's the effect of my life, why

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runin' like were runnin the gun
You know we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won
I work and done
You know I'd rather be with you

On the road doin' shows
My lifes been crazy 
For the past five years it's been me and my lady
Only good things come to those who truly believe
All the time I spent alone, 
never thought I would leave
Now the life I live and learn 
I ain't takin' nothin' back
With the things that has happened
That be makin' me sad
Another day goes by
Gotta show respect
With the love that I get and I don't regret

Another town pound another show we must erect
Another day closer to being home again
With the tears, blood and sweat
The sacrafices made, there were fans in PA
That we wanted to play
But before gettin' paid
Way back when we were dreamin'
When we worked the nine to five
Cover up the triple beamer
When I never thought I'd leavin'
Have you always by myside
How'd I end upon this road
It's the effect of my life, why

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runnin' like were runnin' the gun
You know we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won
I work and done
You know I'd rather be with you

Can't stop our ?bowls? penetratin our zone
The freedom fight song
multiplyin' like clones
Everydays a new day
Gettin high feelin' lovely
Light the ?fire? so it rise above me

Treated us right
The mood is wrong
It's the people who fight
Sing this song
So everybody unite
Freedom fighters keep pushin' on

In the aftermay of the bed to won
We celebrate, with the risin' sun
The summers dry, God got me on the run
And we won't stop, until the war is won

Because run for miles, miles never tire
With love of the people you know were inspired, inspired

We sing this song
So the people unite
Freedom fighters fight on

Like a fugitve were on the run
Runnin' like were runnin' the gun
You know we do it all for you
But on the run to war is won
I work and done

Now why you gotta cramp my style
You kep fuckin' with my high now I'm bout to get wild
Now why you gotta harass the pot dealer
Harass the people at expired parking meters
Why you gotta pull me over
As if I was the dude in the stolen Nova
Now why you gotta badge on your chest
Sting gun on your hip 
and a bulletproof vest
Now why you gotta act like you save the people
You front and you kid just so we can feel equal
Now why you gotta read me my rights
Would you read 'em to your wife
Fuck no Jesus Christ
Now why you gotta hang cuff me tight
In the middle of the night 
Treat me like a murder type
Now why you gotta, gotta, gotta nuttin
Gotta get out my face

That are catchin or feelin'
Know what I'm dealin what is delt with
Felt up in the melt
The laws ???????? flowin liquidfying lava
We could be makin it harder
Listen up and try to follow
Now, Why you gotta pull me over in my van
Give a ticket for gram it cost bout a grand
And why you gotta slow the fuck out your roll
I know I'm not speedin I'm in cruise control
So now you gotta find another reason why
You can stop flashin your lights 
don't have to viloate my rights ah
No you don't have let me say your alone
Pigs bust in your home guns drawn to your dome
Why you gotta have a chip on your shoulder
passed the ?????? test I said I was sobber
I thought I told ya don't try to pull this on me
I know between procedure and police brutality
So tell me why, you insult me and gain stupidity
Why you think your smarter cause you GED
I get high and fly I don't drink and drive
And you fuckin with my flight so I gotta ask why

Tell me why

So tell me why its always you against me

Now everytime I turn the corner
Cops all up in my business
Always tryin plan shit, Let me get a witness
Its gettin serious and funny to me
Another day another ticket takin money from me
Now they'd try to pull us over 
cause were bangin the bus
The Fish, Johnny Richter, myself and The Judge
Who can you trust when the worlds crupt
Its got the crokked ass cops that put my ass in cuffs

Whys the police always stressin other people
They say protect and serve yet the never treat us equal
All across the nation people strivin to be equal
Another uprisin they don't want to see the sequal
Why you think you don't need no invitation
They rushed up in my house it was a fucked up situation
Tearin' up my pad searchin for the cultivation
Justified these actions through your racist legislation

The thinker can't remember ever slippin in some shit
Windin up behind some bars with purple rings around my wrists
Havin' to wait 10 hours just to take a fuckin piss
When your name is just a number as a person you don't exist
When you realize that no one really gives a fuck
When you finally realize when you start to get back up
To many people I know for bullshit got locked up
To many times I asked why so now I gotta say wha

Tell me why
You want to fuck with me
(why you gotta)
Is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King

So tell me why its always you against me

But a college drop out that don't
Mean shit because this not turning back
I got my bong my buds and my baseball bat ready for what ever at

Any time would ever
You gotta have that mental or this shit will get you no where
Got be cleaver and put it all together
Remember that saying I float like a feather come on dog how could
You think that you got it
Twisted do the math

[Chorus]

Back now daze tensions high seems everyone's on edge walking
Over pits of fire on a skinny ledge
Now daze you loose control it's take what you can get where
Anarchy reigns supreme you ain't seen
Nothing yet now turning back now we going out full throttle",Full Throttle

Favorite song on the radio playin'
And you're family's all around you, if you know what I'm sayin'
The feelin's tight with lots of smoke in the air
You're just bein' yourself, cause good times is true wealth
Now I've been through it all from the thick to the thin
I Fought in many battles, some I did not win
You take the good with the bad, you gotta play what you're delt
And mary's love helps to ease all the pain I felt
So this I dedicate to her, May she one day be free
Free to grow upon this earth, and free to reproduce seeds
Free so all my fellow brethren can breath easily
And free so we can live in peace with unity

We need some positive vibes for these rainy days
Let the sun come out keep pushin' these clouds away
We need some positive vibes life's for fun so go and play
Let the sunlight in, brighten up your day

Let the vibes blow like the ocean breeze
Mamma always told me there'd be days like these
Keep your head right, just do as you please
Never interfere with an evil man's schemes
Keep your heart pure, conceive your own dreams
Respect your fellow man, the earth with the trees
The air that we breathe and the highest mountain peak
Bring truth from your soul to your mouth when you speak

No need to get loud .. messin with others, stressin' your brother, it's time to uncover
Time to choose another path you see
Cause the road most traveled's negativity
Put your fist down (fist down), throw your hands in the air
Respect yourself, be somebody who cares
Don't let life get you down, don't feel abused
Keep a positive view unto yourself be true

[Chorus]

Everyday's a new adventure You got to keep what you got
Livin' life in a studio bustin' rhymes in my socks
I got to keep my head up and always do what I feel
Avoidin all the evil and just keeping it real
(I need some positive vibes)
All these situations I keep hearin' about
People dyin' in planes and buildings crumbling down
This world goes round for no apparent reason
People robbin and theavin' just to feel good for the evening
(I need some positive vibes)
What happen' to everybody's peace and love
Throw your drinks the sky, raise your hands up above
Get yo hand out of the gutter and be respectful
We need some positive vibes for these rainy days so let it go
Don't never get it twisted when I'm on this track
D-Loc the kind kid that be kickin' it back
Of the class everyday I was high
Goin to school in 95 easy that how we ride

[chorus]

It's time to leave this rat race track down Babylon
Keep my head straight, keep my family movin' on
Find my own pace, create my own space
Detach my whole scene from this wicked rat race
These two-faced friends, the snakes in the grass
Daddy always told me there'd be men like that
So watch your own back keep your eye on your stash
Don't ever write a check that that ass can't cash

[Chorus]

We need some positive vibes
(Keep on reaching for it)
For these rainy days
(Keep on hoping for it)
Let the sun come out keep pushin' these clouds away

We need some positive vibes

Life's for fun so go out and play

Not hurtin' nobody, not polluting the youth

Designed to enlighten your mind - legalize the word freedom till the plants not

By the way I got the freaks on wait
Call up the krew, hook it up. Late.""
I hung up with X and gave my boys a holla
D-loc picked up said, ""What's up balla?""
Just drop in a dime and tell him about this party
There'll be a lotta beer and some naughty hotties

I took it to the head like a mothafuckin' pro
Yo, that drink got me on tilt
Ya better sit down 'cause you about to spill
Now we approach up on the corner of the house party
I'm down a tall one, i get buzzed, a nightly duty
Conversation with the krew, I thought you knew to pass the brew
Taste that kind of breeze, Saint your ass is through
Break out the beer bong man I want to get faded
'cause drinkin' out the bottle is just so overrated
Well well well, grab the 22 and fill it up with Mickeys
Now what's up you drunk bitch? You spillin' on my Dickies
Well boost up the bass, and go easy on the treble
And let 'em all know that we some psycho rebels

'cause runnin' local parties is a nightly occupation
I feel too ripped, I felt a finger in my back
""Hey I like your shirt"", yeah I see it is quite phat
But no time to mack 'cause Saint's drunk as hell
He was standin' on the table and he started to yell
""All the freaks up in the party
Move around and shake your body
And if you're down with the boys of P-Town
Lemme see somebody get naughty
Is the west coast in the house?
Well pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!""
Well get naughty they did and these girls start to strip
Started freakin' on my shit and her boyfriend tried to trip
I said ""You talk shit, punk? Let's step outside""

He got a left to the cheek, skateboard to the dome

Trying to run up in my life, and tell me what to do
You need to arrest your son, because he's selling pounds of weed
He's getting over on you, and you're stupid enough not to see

You ask, how much money have I spent buying weed?
Not at much as I spend on important legal fees
You wouldn't believe how much it costs to be free
A couple of G's every time they find a roach on me
Shit, I never learn, the lesson they teach
Do the robot (??) When they pull the gun and say ""freeze""
Get off these, you're the one being thieves
Take away my rights and detach my salaries

Yo, I'mma keep baling, fuck the police
Alcohol is legal need to legalize weed
I know they know, so what's the problem?
You got the gun, I got the plant that's how we solve em

You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
Take's me to plant my seeds all across the land, across the land
Mr. Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Freedom of the plant, as we came to take a stand, take a stand

why'know I never understand them nigga stands on the plant
While it grows on a branch, holding a gun in yo' hand?
Cause more people on the earth, but illegal it's absurd
What's more evil a weapon or some herb?

Yo, relax and kick back, worry about real crimes
Smoking a plant? You're out your fuckin' mind
Gimme a break, yo ass fake as fake
Faker then the people putting food on your plate

Stop that, drop that, give me that mic
Rough me, cuff me, read me my rights
No work higher, born and bred, black boots, billy clubs on my head
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck that shit
Legalize freedom celebrate gods gift

You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, rahhhhh!
Mr. Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Protect and serve, slap my face that must be illegal sir
Fingers in my cavity? It struck a nerve
Now I'm on Apollo (?) street now I'm saved
(No Idea what he says here, just random yelling me thinks)
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, rahhhh!
Swear to god, smoke on one with the law but it was mad
Never thought that he had it, but he used mace (?)
Hit me with his billy club it's just a plant
(No idea again)
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, who's the criminal?
You got the gun, I got a plant, you got the gun, rahhhhh!
Mr. Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey)
Officer man, police officer man, with the gun in your hand (hey hey hey hey hey)

Let the sun shine
All I wanna do is live this beautiful life,
Feel free wit my girl,
My friends and family,
Spread my peace and love and truth and unity,
Tryin to stop all the violence and the wars over sea's,
People come people go,
I know this lifes a trip
But I cant be depressed over someone elses nonsense
The bong tokin' alcoholics theres no reason or time for me to be mad or sad,
So do you even really know?

Some like sunshine some like rain,
Some like pleasure and some like pain,
Some like peace and some like war,
And some don't even know what there fightin' for

And I hope all the soldiers come back safe real soon,
We got peoples being fought on the streets everyday,
Wile the rich fill there pockets and the po(poor) just pay,
Uhh,im fightin for love and fightin for life,
Against those doing wrong and for those doing right,
Yea, for my family and my future to come,
Cause if I don't fight now there just might not be one.

Oh oh

You see I can see light in the strangest ways,
On the darkest nights and the coldest days,
And im amazed that some how that I can keep smilin,
I can hear music in the depths of silence,
I can find peace in the middle of violence
And I can be calm when I should be wild
And I can find hope when there is despair
And I don't feel alone when there's no one there.

Some like sunshine some like rain,
Some like pleasure and some like pain,
Some like peace and some like war,
And some don't even know what there fightin' for
What your fightin' for?
What your fightin' for?
Do you even really know what your fighting for?

Now I finally understand how crime pays
Its the plan that's designed through corruption
Total domination, mass destruction
Or mass distraction you do the math
When 1+1 don't equal 3 no
It's like a sickness that they don't want the cure for
Apocalyptic and only been sured for
It's like we're doomed and were headed for our last days

Think about the good things in life
Because negativity only brings fatality, fatalities bring broken hearts,

I see my friends going down the wrong path so I realize
Keep on striven stay true to myself and try to find my peace of mind

I mean goddamn you gotta have big time revolution era
The revolution will not be televised
I repeat, the revolution will not be televised

I say you're wrong
You destroy lives, you build up bombs
Spin all your lies, I say we're spun

You call it war, it's just begun

We fight with thoughts, you fight with guns
You make the laws, fill all the jails

Fill us with fear, that's where you failed

Corrupting, controlling us all with their
Lies, the bombs keep exploding
The earth is eroding

They keep on reloading, and firing lies
Stand at salute and then cheer
When they shoot down my lady [unverified]
So what will it take for this whole thing to break

For People to awake and realize, it's all lies
They got us believing, but always deceiving
And what we're receiving, is nothing but lies
We need to increase peace, we need to stop all the wars

Innocent people are dying for no reason, what for?
Lies, the shit we keep making
The bombs we keep dropping
We're killing each other

We're the people who could stop them
Who're they trying to fool?
We the leaders of the new school
We fight for our rights

Realize the governments full of lies
Don't ask us why, you can see it in our eyes
Who is he? Who is she?
You got me screaming to myself

Lies, smile in your face while they're laughing inside
Tell you what you wanna hear but its all a bunch of lies, lies
Tax type, no hope for senior citizens, social security
And health benefits being questioned

Its all bullshit, it's just a big scam
Uncle Sam got us fighting family wars on foreign land
Mass destruction, where they at?
How many soldiers gotta die before we bring America's kids back?

This is a freedom song, songs of freedom
Stand up for your rights, right means not wrong
One life, one chance, one earth, one people
You decide

Right, you say you're right
I say you're wrong
You destroy lives, you build up bombs
Spin all your lies, I say we're spun

You call it war, it's just begun
Now we'll take it back

Sick of the game you like to play

In this life, depend on no other
That's the way that it's supposed to be
Me for you and only you for me

You help me see so many beautiful things
Open my eyes, made me constant on my surroundings
Help me think before I speak, you put my mind at ease
When I had you by my side, I was truly a king
Unstoppable together, we're like Bonnie and Clyde
Damn I miss my aunt, I wish she was still alive
Nothin to do with the song, but her name was Bonnie
I still miss her to this day, but this simply is beyond me
Can't change the past, that's a lesson I learned
Cause when you're down and out, your family is the only place to turn
Believe me, cause I know, been down that road and crashed
It feels so good to know I have someone to make me laugh
Complete I'm feelin, you're the reason I do
No one, there's no way I could ever repay you
Priceless in my eyes, you're my diamond in the rough
I promise to be here forever, I ain't never givin up

Look at you now, wow it's mind blowin
You went from a seed to be fully grown
Expanding perfectly right before my eyes
I love to see your face everyday when I rise
You're like a pool of water, rainbows and blue skies
You're my beautiful daughter, help me realize
My true potential, to love with real life
I could be high forever with you by my side
I know its not easy goin through rough waters
But I try to love your mom like a real man oughtta
Teach you respect and how you should be treated
Sacrifice today like the miles between us
It might sound corny puttin this in a song
But its my gift to you to carry all life long
And one day, we'll look back and laugh

I been wantin' to write you a letter
But I think it would sound better
If I put it in song form, okay
First of all, I just wanna thank you for being you
You know, the way you look, the way you feel, your touch
It's so real, we gettin' stronger as the days pass by
I can still remember when you cried for the first time in my arms (yeah)
I was right there to make you strong

Kottonmouth Kings,"[Chorus]
It don't matter where you've been
Just focus on where you're going
Most people you think are friends
Ain't there when the tough gets going
Remember to keep your friends
Be wise with those you've chosen
Cause only your closest friends
Are there when the going gets tough

When I think about it the definition change
Back in the old days it wasn't quite the same
Or maybe it was but on another level
Still pushing dirt with a different type of shovel
Loyalty, trust, unconditional foundation
Builds everlasting bonds and relations
I've got friends I haven't seen in years
I'd die for tonight forget and have a couple beers
On the other hand you never know where you stand
With certain types of friends they'll sell you out for some ends
Or some pussy or some weed or a business transaction
Some use words but I prefer action
I'm a break you off like an old school player
My x-ray vision helps me see through the layers
Of you fakes, phonies, lies and deception
Ask Matt Hall if you need a life lesson

[Chorus]

I've been all around the world and I met a lot of people
These fakes and phonies yo these cats I see through
Dickheads and homies some others glad to meet you
You better give respect to the ones that believed you
And were there by your side when the going got tough
And had your back when you got to fuck someone up
And lent you a buck when you was broke and hungry
And gave you a place to sleep living in their luxury
Big Up to Chucky that's my dog for real though
What up to Judge D since back in junior high school
Johnny Rich? that's my man Mr. Brando
My partner in crime with the gangsta flow
Daddy X, Big Pak, be, Lou, Munch, Kev, Flo
Cause if ya don't know now you know
Fuck the rest
What's up though
P.S. to my shoulder blade Alison Marie
What up baby
Fuck what yall think

[Chorus]

To make it in this life you got to know who your friends
Your boys, your dogs, the ones with you til the end
The ones that never crack it, they never even bend
I mean like when your ass is broke they got the money to lend
The type that when you need a ride they give you the car
You don't worry about them running cause they'll always stand hard
Late night, can't drive, man you never too far
Barbecue by the pool chilling in the back yard
Stepping out on a Friday never leave you behind
The first to call you up when they're hitting the kind
None the less don't stress cause it'll always be fine
Like everything I got is yours and what you got is mine
Walk in the front door like they own the crib
But hey, what's theirs is yours and what's yours is theirs
I can't explain it no better that's just how it goes
Real friends can't be bought it's got to come from the soul so

Just running your mouth because you can talk some shit
Ain't got nothing to show for busting cool ass raps
But that's cool with me dog where your money at
I'm talking about the hustle even if your fresh see you're wack
I get paid homey rubber band man stacks

Give me a five and I'll make it a twenty
Give me a fifty and I'll turn into a couple a hunnies
Give me ten G's and I'll show you what I can do
Johnny Richter's on the hustle and we grabbing loot
I used to slang and serve sacks on a day to day basis
Now I serve and slang raps fill my beats with bass
It's a game it's a hustle we all paper chasing
On the road for two months coming home with bacon

[Chorus]
You can't stop our hustle
You can't stop this
You can't stop our hustle
Don't even try kid
You can't stop our hustle
We world wide now
You can't stop our hustle
Koast II Koast blaow
You can't stop our hustle
The game's all the same
You can't stop our hustle
Just trying to make some change
You can't stop our hustle
It's time to build the stacks
You can't stop our hustle
So where the hustlers at

Everybody knows I got cops on the payroll
So just lay low until I say so
When that whistle blow we'll all be splitting dough
Nobody act dumb until the orders come
There will be enough cheese to spread for everyone
Making legal money and the feds hate it
Real underdogs most underrated
We got the underground locked branded and spaded

Watch me get my boogie on and flex this muscle
Ten years later D-Loc still on the hustle
I'm a get my grind on dig them out with a shovel
Keep stacking my chips then watch my ends bubble
Let the double double stack them up to the ceiling
When this shit's all done with I'll be worth a million
Watch me shine just let me smoke this bud
Let me drink this cocktail I feel like getting' fucked up

[Chorus]

I'm gonna hustle until the wheels fall off
Keep on going out for mine never punching a clock
Ã???Cause the hustle don't stop the game waits for nobody
Just trying to make some cash like my last name was Gotti
Stay on the grind like Independent trucks
Fifty fifty five-o let me know what's up
And you can still catch me on the streets of P-Town
I can still add sacks all the way to a pound

Don't matter none what you say or what you do
Throw salt in the game but it's coming right back at you
Snitches and bitches dirty rats and double crossers
Fuck off we the underground bosses
Fuck off like Shaggy 2 Dope said
These are family ties we all breaking bread
Legendary
You eat crumbs from the table
Wipe your mouth you're dropped from the label

'Cause that's when the party's gonna begin
That's when I'm showing up yo so that's when the party begins
'Cause when I walk in the door the whole place goes bananas
I got party planners from California to Atlanta
Always got a moving camera for those girls gone bad
A couple Alabama slammers now they're calling me dad
Now this nights a definite success
'Cause there's a bunch of girls with some big old breasts
Which means a long line of people willing to pay
At twenty bucks a head for me a nice payday
And it don't stop until I pass out
Sorry if I don't know ya homie but you're assed out
This after party's at my house right now it's maxed out
You smell what I'm sizzlin' you know what I'm talking about
Where's the party!!!

[Chorus:]

Bounce
Boogie down skate high
Come dipping through the party around 12 'o'clock
Pants sagged hat cocked got some weed in my pocket
Walk up in the spot shit pop like rockets
Head straight to the bar so I get my drink on
Pound that shit quick and order another one
People taking pictures of D-Loc the dog
Bitches taking off their tops DJ playing my songs
Got my girl in my arms and we getting towed back
Kiss me on the neck rubbing on my nut sack
Got the back thong on 'cause she know I like that
Got my hand down her pants feeling down her ass crack
It's time to smoke a blunt 'cause we getting fucked up
Walking through the dance floor throwing shit up
All the homies is drunk and the records still spinning
When the DJ is done I'm a go home and fuck

[Chorus:]

Hey ladies you looking kind of sexy
I be smoking up that chronic not the mexi
You know that 'cause I'm King Daddy X see
Put you on the payroll and the party's never ending
It's like throwing gasoline on a fire
I own the club you don't need a fucking flyer
I thought you knew I had friends in high places
We should get together and exchange some fuck faces
Now that's exactly how I hooked up with my wifey
Now she's the only one left to entice me
Late night we got the party favors
Open up the stash box we got the thirty one flavors
Turn the music up forget about the neighbors
We getting fresh like a pack of Life Savers
Ever sat legs wide on a kings throne
It's over there girl make yourself right at home

I'm just doin my time
(it ain't easy)it ain't easy when your facin incarceration for a victimless crime(it ain't easy) 

Johnny Richter:

Now I've seen a lot of people who got it worse than me
Strugglin to survive, fightin just to feel free 
Incarcerated over dealin with a plant
Or standing up for themselves for dealin with the man
Its hard to think in a world of today
That people get locked away for a victimless crime
Doin serious time we must be out of our minds
We need to stand up and get the laws refined
Its up to us to stop writtin the tracks
Start demanding the facts make the right decision
A country run by the people was americas vision
A democratic society where we're in a position
That's why we have the right to vote
But look what happened
We legalize weed and the governments laughin
Bush is still in office so we still in iraq
We need to open up our eyes and take the power back

Daddy X:

I served my time like a man
Get up and take a stand
My life is in your hands
And that ain't right

in this world its all contained
From time to time we all make mistakes
Sometimes in life you can't catch a break
Living hand to mouth going day to day
And your personal lives start to get you down
And there's not enough goodness to spread around
All the views of the world start sleepin in
And the sides of the walls start creepin in
Now your thinkin crazy thoughts of desperation
And your faced what you don't want to be facin
Situations, sticky situations
Freedom dead now incareration

(chorus)

D-Loc:

how come the government can send us to fight
But I can't do the things that I want like smoke a pipe
Its punishment, crazy and people lose their rights
Over something so simple that grows from the sky
Keep askin my self the same old questions
No answers just a bunch of complications
Its confusin but oh well
This lifes a trip with so many stories to tell

Bye.

One day I'll be floating in the sky flying like a bird looking down at you. Wonder why I'm up
Here
And I am not down there and all the people that I miss and the family the ones who really care.
Living through my music; living through my voice being loved every time someone grooves it.
One day is going to be the last time I hear my voice on the track.
Now one day not a worry in the world no stress no nothing just miss my girl
Now you tell me why we got to die if god creates us then he kills us at the same time.
Why do I ask myself why one day I'll be dead and gone and miss all the things that I love and
Adore?
I know I hurt when I see you there.

One day, one day, people will be walking on water.
One day, one day, the human race will never die.
One day, one day, we will fly around in flying saucers.
One day, one day, freedom will be legalized.
One day:one day:one day:

One day I am going to invent a new drug disconnect from the system just unplug.
Buy a pop gun; shoot a peace love drop a love bomb and give the world a hug.
One day I won't have to fear a cop, or a security guard what a dope beat drop.
One day I want to body surf a rainbow, swim through a room of clouds blow an end-o.
I want to elevate and unify mankind. Everybody is just walking in the sunshine.
One day there'll be a block party for the world and I'll never have to be away from my girl.
One day I plan a cherry orgasm infiltrate the atmosphere so everybody has one.
Come together, a global climax, just imagine a universal sun splash.

One day, one day, people will be walking on water.
One day, one day, the human race will never die.
One day, one day, we will fly around in flying saucers.
One day, one day, freedom will be legalized.
One day:one day:one day:

I hope one day people will say I was a good guy and every time they were around me I made them
Smile.
But in the close future I hope to raise my family in a society full of suburban noise families.
And So I hope one day soon we will make a change and when I'm dead I hope my life I didn't
Live in vain.
I know in my heart that I tried to live right and I will fight to the death until freedom is
Legalized.
Then I know one day my kids will have a chance to raise children of their own and own their
Own lands.
And when this day comes I hope I am still alive to see the dream we envision finally realized.
Yes one day I think we'll all recognize the government's a big pain infiltrated with lies.
And on this day we need to make a decision: we going to follow the blind or the people with
Vision?

We're the Kings of the Chronic and this is how we do

When I bounce out, I got a pocket full of weed
Pants always sagged, Double Dash burnin' trees
??? Can't understand the next line ???
Stop at the liquor store to get a little somethin'
Pick a 12 pack up, a couple of blunts
Go back to the crib, now it's time to get drunk
Call my girl up, 'cause I need a lil' love
Roll another blunt, let the smoke float above

J Rich:
On a Sunday afternoon, just washin' my car
Gettin' it ready for the night and the boulevard
Polishin' all the chrome and shinin' up the tires
Smokin' joint after joint, I couldn't get no higher
Keep a mini-bong chillin' in my cup holder
Plus a bag in my lap full of nothin' but the dosha
Cruisin' out the neighborhood on a slow stoncreek (??)
I'm just out ridin' high, simply doin' my thing

(CHORUS)

be Real:
Hittin' the weed and become just like me
Kush smokin' rebel full of THC (??)
One hit, two hit, three hit, four
Then five more hits from my eight foot Roor
Then roll that shit up and hit it, pass it around
Don't hog it up or we take it away and put you down
You wanna medicate, meditate
Been known for hittin' the bong, blunts, and the vaporate
We ridin' high with an endless supply
Because we ?? and put the red in your eyes
We sack it up in three months, packin' the free lunch
After the 420, we stackin' the damn money
And so it goes if you're holidn' the dro
Break it out, blaze it up, then you hittin' & hold (??)
With the KMK or the Cypress blend
You better twist those ends and go tell your friends

Kicking it with bass getting crazy straight ryling

Looking out for ya and watching ya back 
I'll be your gardian angel on your side and that's a fact

A sad story but it needs to be told
I'ts been a bless yes so much fun
I can't believe its here, never thought it would come
I've always been afraid to know I'm gunna die
To face the facts in this thing called life
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao free my soul
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao until we meet again
For my family and freinds, I can't thank you enough
For all the memories, I know it's gunna be tough

It's funny thing too sometimes
On the road of life it's full of surprises
Twist and turns we look toward the sky for some guidance
The sun goes down and it rises
Withstood the sands of time
And we'll find new horizons

Sometimes I lay awake at night and try to figure it out
Is my life going north is it heading south
I'm walking on a fence between wrong and right
Trying to keep a level head try to keep my goals in sight
It's hard as hell in this world today friends
I've known for many years started acting strange
Things I cared about before seemed to just fade away
Now I'm left with these questions of today

""When is the train ganna get back on track
When am I even ganna care bout that
Why do I always get dealt the bad cards
Took the easy the road so long and now my life's hard""

If I knew when I started where this all would end
I'd prolly do it all over again

I've looked in people's eyes and told some lies (yeah)

The beautiful hills mountains and streams

Stay on my path follow my road
Do all the right things to achieve my goals
Perusing my dream in life I lead
Become who I want when I want anytime I please
I no where I'm going
If I keep it on track
Just stay on my line only time will tell
I pray to the one over looking my trail

For speaking my mind
Been baptized in lies
Given bad advice

Never compromise
Watch your back
As you watch your ends multiply
Look a man in his eyes
And never ever say die
Keep your eye on the prize
And you'll stay on the rise
I'm a king world wide
And I'm going to stay on the ground
I've been behind the glass but I always rebound

Simply reality of life
Now death to the motherfucker that causes strife

R.I.P. Uncle Roy God bless your wife
R.I.P. Uncle Mark God bless your wife
I guess we can't call em in this life of the strife
Now my pops was there when Uncle Roy got buried

So my pops was there when Sheila got married

I was there for myself and Big Hoss in the pen

Just don't take it for granted

Life, to live while you live
Death, to give what you get
Pain, the reality of change
I wonder whether, things will ever get better

Everday, there's more pain that comes my way
And so I pray, the Lord to take me away
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me

I picture life as a dream here today gone tomorrow
Love equals hollow, hate equals sorrow
Now follow the real as I take you to a field in my mind where I journey
Sucker bitches can't burn me, bring an attorney

'Cause since child birth I've been raised to do dirt on this earth
Yes it hurts
To find out that I can't get away from all the pressures and pain
And misfortunes that I've gained straight

Sometimes a fire grows inside, hatred starts to rise
Still I can't despise all the lies I've been told, the secrets they hold
The government control, man fuck five-O
So I say, keep your faith in the J, Saint Dog and great smokes a pack a day

Keep your faith in the J, every day I pray
Keep your faith in the J, man pass it this way

All that I have is gone
Packed my bags and just disappeared
And I search for the street
Where we used to meet
To find you again my dear

There's somebody
Who'll be there as I break
Be the blood in my veins as I sing
When I hear the sound
Of the underground
It will bring you back to me

All that I had is here
I would sing and there you would be
In the heat of the night,
There you left my side
Now london has started to freeze

All that I want is here
I will drink and there you will be
There's a space in a bar
And a brand new star
If I can standon my own two feet

There's somebody
Who'll be there as I break
Be the blood in my veins as I sing
When I hear the sound
Of the underground
It will bring you back to me

I'll smoke a cigarette
And toast the dead
All I can see is your fuckery
Exactly like you said

Who'll be there as I break

It's his love that makes me strong

Being happy loving whom I please
And each time we make romance,
I'll be thankful for a second chance

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Krafty Kuts,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Keeping us from being together
How long has it been since I've seen your smile
In this tunnel called the night
I can finally see a light
I've got a burning deep inside
I thought you might understand
I'm drivin' as fast as I can
And you said you'd wait for me

Going back to the place where my heart belongs
Goin' home
Going back where I left my family
Goin' home
And I hope that they're still waitin' there for me

In the eyes of the legal tender
You're the one who must surrender
I think they call it responsibility
I'm a man in emotion
With only one compulsion
I've got to follow these dreams inside my heart
I'm not looking for a fight
No one's wrong and no one's right
Maybe we all need time apart

An den besten Freund verloren und mit Ihr die Plagen

Wie das Salz in der Wunde, die niemals verheilt
Warum hab ich dir nie selber mal die Wahrheit gesagt
Zu viel falscher Stolz war alles was ich dir gab
Dass die Schuld auch bei mir lag ist mir schon klar

Und dass jeder andere zwischen dir und mir nur stört

Zu spät für uns zwei, für mich ist's Zeit zu gehen
Zu spät die Zeit ist überlebt, unsere Grenzen wollte ich nie sehen

Zu spät für mich wars allerhöchste Zeit

Prost, mein Bruder, auf Dein Wohl! 
Für alle Zeiten unseren Weg gemeinsam gehen! 

Stets im Gedächtnis dieser Tag als es zu Ende ging
Die Jungs getrennt bis auf ein paar
Die heut und hier zusammen sind
Und wieder heben wir das Glas
Uns hat Vernunft niemals besiegt
Und auf wenn alle Stricke reißen 
Jemand an Deiner Seite steht! 
Ein Wehrmutstropfen nie verrinnt
Entrissene Freundschaft derer die viel zu früh gegangen sind!
Und trotzdem denk' ich gern zurück, an unbeschwerte Tage 
Wir waren jung, völlig verrückt!

Ich hab' gedacht das alles fällt mir nicht so schwer. 
Die Zeiten ändern sich, doch ich komm' nicht mehr hinterher. 
Die Brücken abgebrannt zu Allem was mal war 
ich halte dennoch daran fest was lieb'
 und teuer war und ist!

Auf das was war - auf was noch kommt
Auf die Jungs die an meiner Seite stehen 
Wir werden nie ein Ende sehen! 
Und wir werden weiter trinken 
Prost, mein Bruder, auf Dein Wohl! 
Für alle Zeiten unseren Weg gemeinsam gehen!

Ich hab' gedacht, ich hab' gehofft, 
Ich hab' geglaubt das alles fällt mir nicht so schwer
Die Zeit verändert mich doch ich bin und bleibe trotzdem hier! 
Ich hab's gewusst, vorhergesehen
Es kann nicht jeder bis zum Ende mit Uns gehen
Ein letzter Gruß an die vor Jahren mal unsere Weggefährten waren!

Auf das was war auf was noch kommt
Auf die Jungs die an meiner Seite stehen 
Wir werden nie ein Ende sehen! 
Und wir werden weiter trinken 
Prost, mein Bruder, auf Dein Wohl!

Krayzie Bone,"The drama just goes on and on
Drama be just part of my life
It's been like that since I was born
Yes I can run but I can't hide
Gonna be like that until I'm gone
Drama always seems to find me, find me, find me

Roll down my family tree with me
Give it up page to page
We never no stuggles
I never knew no hustlers like my
Daddy and Mamma so I
Gotta drop my P's
But I think way back in the day now
When moms and pops had my back
They stayed down
And gave us a place to lay down
But then
Then when the wind blew in
(?) the crackpot
But lately it's keeping my people up off the hinges
Can I get a witness baby
And I'm off the dope
Cause I'm gonna make me some money my own
Somebody tell me now where we went wrong
I'll bring my family back because they long gone
Now pops don't even come around
But I know pops got problems
that's why your little niggas still down
With cha
But it hurts to see a family taking a beating
My sisters keep saying they hungry [hungry]
Got to come up on some way to feed em
Big (?) take a ride slide down 71 callin welfare
When the cheque come mom she hound everyone
So bang bang
Gotta get down for my thang
Swang with a my thugsters
Pump, we never did love ya
St. Claire struggler
Here your hustla baby

Chorus 2 times

I can't get away from all these dramas surrounding me
Hounding me
Heavily coming down on me
Drama be pounding my brain
Calling my name
These demons they seem to be following me
Come in all shapes and sizes
Enemies my friends it don't surprise me
I try to help niggas make better
But they ain't appreciate
niggas they rather stay back in the ghetto
Well oh well
If that's how you want it nigga
Then go ahead
But don't fuck with me
I'm up in this bitch like Micahel Jackson
I wish they'de leave me alone
Before I show the other side of me
Bang bang bang bang bang
that's how it be
Nigga gonna get violent
But if my so-called ex friends want to try me
Bloody riot 
that's how we like it
You all invited
Get so heated you feel the temperature rising
So heated we spit black flames
4-page article
On the police
Couldn't find that them bitches was particles
For fucking with me
And I'm down to stand on the frontline and get wild
One of the first to get up and get down
Niggas ain't knowin' the anger inside me
And then when I finally snap nigga out
Fuck up your sister your daddy your momma your brother
If you he some drama
c'mon  c'mon  c'mon.

Chorus 2 times",Drama
Krayzie Bone,"Chorus:

They call me the ""Dummy Man"" (man, man, man)
And I'm up early tryina slang my dope 
(I'm the nigga with the biggest rocks)
The fiends...they get awfully mad....(mad, mad, mad)
When they go broke on dope and it's really soap 
(My nigga you ain't never lied)

Verse 1:

Up in the morning....and I feel like I don't want to be livin'
Better off dead without no bread....have you ever felt that feeling?
Unsatisfied, feelin' like you want to die
When you reach into your pocket and can't even find
Not even enough to go purchase a dime (sack of weed)
But FUCK THAT!  I got ""come up"" in my blood
Cause it's the ""1st of the Month"" (nigga what!)
The perfect time to come up
The only problem is: I'm broke and ain't got no dope
But as I was standin' in my bathroom mirror....I looked at the soap
Shit...soap look a little like dope (you scandalous nigga!)
Then, I chopped-chopped up me some counterfeit amphetamines
But wait a minute.....
Wait a minute now...what if they want to taste it?
Think quickly for cash: nigga dash to the kitchen, get the bread bag
Wrap that bread around some soap
Now I got the breadcrumb-dumb-dumb dope
It might sound funny, but it ain't no joke...
cause doin this shit could get a nigga smoked, mayn
But FUCK IT! Young nigga gotta get them duckets
Hit the medicine cabinet for the final touches...
Orajel for the numbness
Then I hit the corner with a handful of breadcrumbs...
nigga got the dumb-dumb for ya
And the pump on approach if you say it ain't dope, 
only dealin cause I hate to be sober
Peep, ""creep on ah come up"", I wait for a fiend to roll up
And walk to the car with my hand on my pistol, 
he showed me the green, said 
""Hold  up...gotta get my stash""
Nigga need a 20...but I got that faded
Lovin these yum-yums, glad I made it; 
I just hope this nigga don't try to taste it!
I dropped him the dummy, he said it was lovely
But as he pulled off, I pinned that he put the rock up in his mouth
(So he gon' come back for his money!)
I pinned that he braked...he skid...
Put it in reverse and he came back quick...
Fiend jumped out and he talkin' all big...
This is what happened to this bit....
We beat him and finished him off, and he never came 'round here no more
Cause a nigga ran into yours truly: poor, and a nigga scored
Lord forgive me but i can't remember (the last time I ate)
Now I gots to go get me a plate, or a bit, now I'm proper
Only spent three dollars and forty-four cents, 
nigga full, now I gotta get bent
Nigga still got sixteen dollars and fifty-six cents...HELL YEAH!
These dumb-dums got a nigga off the hook..they got booked, took, shook
Look: got dope but it ain't dope, so I guess you can call me a ""crooked crook""
Hey...do you know somebody like me?
I don't think so, cause ain't nobody I see
Down for the crime like I'm down for mine, 
and if I gotta, nigga I cheat 
(cheat)

Chorus (x2)

So fuck with me, I got the chops mayn (chops mayn)

Krayzie Bone,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind","Pimpz, Thugz, Hustlaz & Gangstaz [Featuring Eightball/MJG/Layzie Bone]"

Krayzie Bone,"Shit
I've been a thug my whole motherfucking life
Struggling, doing what the fuck I've got to do to survive
Bottom line, thugline

You see me on TV but you don't really know me
Don't know the story of the warrior and how I survived in this game
Nigga never had shit
Had to work to get it or I had to steal it

Most of the time I was hungry, that's why I did it
I ain't bullshittin', seventeen
I'm leavin' the house, I need my own
Nigga done tried to be grown and fucked around

Now I'm homeless on the streets
With my niggas I learned about every drug
The heroine, the weed, the speed, the crack, the sherm
But we was broke and we couldn't afford it

But niggas was schemin' and plottin' on shit
Oh yes, you know this, I come from a long line of thugs
Us strugglers hustle what we can rustle up
It might not have been too much

But we always got just enough, our hard times
Kept niggas together through all the windy weather
And nigga whenever you need somebody to roll
I'm goin' to be there, you know me

A nigga stayed thug devoted in the streets
When I didn't have a place to sleep or shit to eat
My family goin through some pains
They struggle but they make out

My people off their hinges and it was against our religion as a witness
So you know I really can't comprehend it
My mother and father told me
""Don't mess with drugs and why you smokin'?""

I was right or wrong? Can't understand it
If the purpose was to have a nigga struggle
I don't think they should have had me, had me
Think they never should of had me
As I drop to my knees, can't you see I ain't happy?

I hope it won't be long, I hope it won't be long
Before I end this song, I wanna end this song
I hope it won't be long, it won't be long
I need to end this song, this sad song

I hope it won't be long, I hope it won't be long
Before I end this song, I need to end this song
I hope it won't be long, it won't be long

Fuck everybody.
We come here to party,
But I know somebody gon' try me,
And get my temperature uprisin'.
Anyway, nigga, we straight to the V.I.P.
Excuse me, we need some Hennessey.
While my niggas is rollin' the sticky,
Pa-pa-pass it, pass it back quickly.
That's when I heard the record skip (They fired)
Security sprayed they mase.
Through all the commotion,
Some nigga jumped right out the car, right up in my face.
Before I could even do somethin', my nigga done rushed him,
Took his ass to the floor.
Now here comes some more.
Now we got a war goin' on,
Tryin' to get back out the door,
And we got our backs against the wall.
Naw, we don't plan to fall, y'all,
'cause we did not get searched
We all got pistols in our drawers.

Bass from the DJ went blank.
Everybody runnin' tryin' to get the fuck up out this place.
I pulled out my gun.
Like 007, rolled under the table.
Unload, reload.
Every muthafucka in the club folded up on the floor.
Niggas was rootin'-tootin'-shootin'.
Security been ran up out the club [Hoes!],
And there ain't nobody left but thugs.
We drunk as fuck,
Fin to shoot this muthafucka up.
Niggas was runnin' up on us 
Like they been waitin' for this shit to happen

For me to get caught in a club riot,
But my thugs tight.
And I can't believe this shit
Nigga caught up in the middle of a war zone (the war zone)
But nigga, if you know a Bone,
Then you know that we get down with the dirty with the chrome
Never leave it home.
Put it to your dome,
And I let it go.
Can't let these niggas run up on me
They bitches.
I put another clip in,
Unload some more,
Keep spittin'.
I never can understand:
If security's got the door,
Then why so many niggas in here got guns?
And I can testify that 'cause I just shot one.
Good thing nigga packed that vest and my weapon,
'cause I'd sure take a strippin',
If a nigga caught me slippin'
Without no protection.

Silence is necessary, don't tell them who you are

(Verse 1-Sin of Graveyard Shift)
Formulate a different tactic, let's sing anthems
No sterotypical categorizing, rising above all make shift realities
Fantasies misconstrued the thoughts of wicked men
They cough as lungs inhale, exhale poisonous gases
Oh well, I guess I'll just protect myself in good help
Done played out the wickedest hand man has ever dealt
I felt like dying just the other day 'cause Satan was trying
Walking too close by my side
Stay still, please don't move your soul you could lose
No crying, where's my blood?
You'll find out soon enough
Alright I'll ride, in due time we'll get our chance to die
Hold on to my mind
No use for guns or drugs, need mo' love
But yet and still, slugs get fired off constantly
Immorally, destroying my holy oracle
But I just ignore it though
Keep a steady pace just movin slow...slow, just movin slow

Silence...silence...silence...silence

(Verse 2-Krayzie Bone)
As I sit in my livin room, chillin in my thug mood
I begin to hear noises comin from the other room
So I pause my Nintendo, then I walk over to the window
Is it paranoia from the indo?
Then goes a thought, then another thought
Run and get the pump, 'who goes there?
What the fuck you want?'
'cause I'm gone off that blunt and I will buck a motha fucka down
You on my grounds
Hope they got enough of the rounds
All of a sudden I heard a crash
My first instinct was to blast, but the Mauseburg didn't last
So I had to dash, ran upstairs I was franic in panic
But I managed to make it to the top, to my artillery shop
I was runnin, but I could hear the souljah's comin
I don't they must think I have some money
AK-47 and a Mack-11
Jettin to the bedroom locked myself in, the clip is in
Teach 'em a lesson it ain't healthy to rob
They fit to slip on the job, soon as they twist on the knob
Just like I figured when they twisted it, the AK-47 was hot
I had to drop it but I emptied it
The Mack-11 would hit, hit the niggaz up from head to toe
Had to escape and I was out the window
Here I do, I hit the ground, uhh
Then I looked around, shook the fall
Hopped in the Benz and hauled
Callin my niggaz let's get ready for war
I think I killed 'em all but I know that they'll be sendin some more
So when they come back around, I say we show 'em rappin don't mean a thang
And this is a gun, and this is a grave
Rest in peace you're not feelin me
Truly Mr. Leatherface, I dedicate thiiis.....

Fight, movin in the night
Daylight, takin slow paces might outrun the race
Never want to rely on murda, enter my life
But life's so strange and hectic all backwards and shelled
The killin factor in jail
The streets is hell, you can tell by the smell
Off with his head oh well
You know they don't give a damn if that make the weak mind feel the same
It's a shame how they watch you, stalk you
Pinnin every step I make, Knowin every breath I take
Makin it easy for the next man to get his hands on a .38
They be buckin on niggaz in these last days
But thanks for the fun
Can't stay focused, causin ruckus
The devil done play with the Earth like a puppet
Now we all in fucked shit

Back in the day we still was thuggin
Nothin changed
Always into somethin
Whatever you name
A young thug with my niggas it's one love
Little bad ass niggas sneaky
A calm collected slickster
I might not have been on the scene
But you could believe I was in the picture
In the mixture selling llello
Scrapping, car jackin, gun packin
I'm lacking everything you can't imagine so I'm praying
Rapping can get me up out this jam
Damn, just gimme a chance
I'll keep 'em dancin, dancin, all night, all night
But times got harder and harder
My dreams got further and further away
And nigga I chased them but couldn't catch them to save my life
So now I'm thugging on this corner
I gotta increase my financial status
I chance it fucking with these rollers when they roll up
Yeah don't want to be locked in no cell
But I also can't take strippin's and be broke with no mail

And they say that gets easier
But to me it only got deeper and deeper

Incarcerated, caught with a twelve gauge
Trying to come up with some money and made a stupid-ass mistake
Could have been my niggas fate
Fucking with shotguns
We out to rob some niggas I'm drunk, I'm pumped
I made a mistake and popped him, now he bleeding
I see blood, damn, get to the doctor, Nigga don't rest in peace
Doctor's took him to emergency
Copper's came and arrested me
Not knowing if my nigga had made it alive and was well
I tossed and turned in my cell knowing he's sweatin like hell
Praise to the Lord and I hope you hear me
And I hope you feel me
I ain't mean to, really, really, I ain't mean it
I know you seen it
I finally spoke to my nigga
He lifted up and recovered
And pressed no charges
Wait the state done picked it up and I gotta trial in a month
Fuck!
And the judge ain't trying to give me no love
Cause it was my first offence
But he just thinkin he lockin up a thug
So now I'm cuffed up on the bus
And ridin' down 71, ain't no fun 

Chorus

Now I'm locked inside this prison system
Biddin and count days left before my sentence
Now I can say that I've been here
But I sure ain't gonna come back here
Uh-uh!
The day they release me I'm going home
I can cope but I can't adjust
These fucking steel doors drivin me nuts
My last month and I'm ready to move out
I'm sure, stay on the low
I listen to thug stories 
And be trippin on niggas love stories
I'm finna get out of this motherfucker
Heard them call out my name
Two fifty two two fifty
Pack up your shit it's your day
Jumped out my bunk, gave all my shit to my niggas
In fact I left everything that I had back in jail but my raps
I'm on the streets now
Scene unchanged
Niggas still the same
I ain't fuckin with you bustas cause I'm tryin to make a change
I got with the real dogs and we was schemin on the mill' ya'll
So we had to chill on ya'll
Get out of Cleveland if we plan to achieve it
So we plannin it with Eazy on Greyhound and now we're leavin

Chorus",That's the Way
Krayzie Bone,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

And we don't wanna hurt nobody, -body

Fuckin' with us is like fuckin' with no condom

Nigga, I ain't the one
Ain't a thang changed, niggas still the same, made a little change

Now they human spaghetti
Steady smooth and very eager to bury enemies
If it be necessary, then nigga wet 'em (go)
And I better go get 'em
We pickin' 'em off with the heater 9-millimeter
Shit to sweep the streets make niggas retreat
That's heat
Now, I repeat if you want some nigga come and get it
Cause we still five live and vicious
Don't get it twisted motherfucker
Run up on us whenever ya wanna get down and dirty
Still stand in the Land with the slugs and my gun in my hand

If you real throw it up but if it's fake
Kill 'em and put 'em in with the rest of them phonies

Zipped up, slip up that body tag
So if you spot him, blast
Better him than you, huh?

Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time

B-B-B-Baby
Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself",When I Die [Featuring Fat Joe/Big Punisher/Cuban Link]
Krayzie Bone,"(chorus)
Buck buck fuck where my thugs at, where the fuck my thugs at
Are you ready for war, got to be ready for war

(verse 1)
Forward march, pull out your weapon aim directly for the heart
Buck the brain and make sure everything stop and listen to the shells drop
As we steady poppin round after round off trumpets fade around us
Bailin through the motherfuckin mud and rain niggas on a mission
Shirt full of bloodstains but I'm still livin
Cause I got the will and the skills
To make it out the killin field alive and killin still
This the type of shit I make you want got our suits on 
Knowin and willin to die with our boots on 
Dressed in fatigues this is real we ain't no actors
We don't wear this shit for no fashion 
You'll see how real it is when we start blasting
Fake niggas always shoot real blanks 
We in the steel tanks
If this was real they'd probably crumble 
How you come to rumble 
When you scared of what's in the jungle, nigga 
Why you tell them people you was killas
I put this on my dead thugs 
When they jump we gon tear it up 
Torpedo one bomb torpedo two to see the destruction 
Military minded so will win 
Strategize, that's all I'm fuckin bout is strategies 
It's all about reality and nigga that's me

(chorus)

Before we fight, I use my mind to pin the situation 
Makin sure the enemies weak before we invade 'em then we break 'em
Organization is a factor 
Comin from the warrior slash the mad rapper
Makin pushes jump out the bushes troopers attack
And the heads of the adversaries bring 'em back to me
If you scared you the first nigga dead 
and the field is gettin deeper 
Drama getting thicker so I pull my pistol quicker
Kill 'em all if they ain't on your team
But watch out for the spies trying to infiltrate the scene know what I mean
We headed for the justice center 
Free all the convicts and let the killas ride with us
Yeah, let's fuck some shit up and get rid of- 
The Law of course voluntarily or by force
This shit just goes on and on
It don't stop until the body rott and they casket drop
In the W-A-are we are the mighty, the mighty, the mighty mighty warriors ready
If they spittin we gone send them bitches slugs 
back it's like that buck buck buck 

(chorus)

Thugs, everywhere you see them niggas want to be 'em
Meet the real thuggish ruggish niggas out of cleveland
The wasteland warriors wild execution style find your body smelling foul
I stay thugged out and enhance my thug mentality
Gotta keep my mental sharper than a pencil
Got bullets in the clip though and you in danger 
If you anger me nigga you'll me the one that's in the chamber  
Paranoia, don't get too close I'll blow your fuckin head right off your shoulders
Cause everything to me is war I'm livin in horror
I'll die before captured (fuck that) 
fuckin with these niggas down to the last clip
Remember the casualties dearly departed 
Keep poppin at these coppers and we'll drop 'em in your honor
You can rest in peace your killas deceased
Where my thugs at buck buck get 'em up so I can see 'em

(chorus)",Where My Thugz At

Scandalous,scandalous,scandalous
Scandalous niggas won't ease up tonight
Niggas on the street don't sleep until we eat it

verse 1:
Oh,we don't have no money
We gotta get money for food on the table
For feedin the youngins
We steadily strugglin thuggin
Broke and we sellin more dope
Both the dummies and dumb-dums
Come on back
Purchase some more
Now whether we mobbin or stick up a store
Fin to get us some dough
My niggas desperate
We ain't ate shit since yesterday
but we got a gauge and plenty of shells
I'm smellin money--cash money
(money,money,money)
First baller we see
We run and buck him
Don't give him a chance to reach
all up under his seat
Now,what if he pull out some heat?
Shit,then we really got to kill him
ain't even worth it my nigga
Give up the dough
don't flex!
My nigga don't try to be no hero
and be glad we only shot you in your legs
Could have been your head
Now what if that there victim was me?
Gettin robbed by these niggas that we
used to be
Id be muthafuckin dead!

Chorus

Verse 2:
You know what we doin up on them police?
We never did love them
Muthafucka we buck 'em
We lucky they die
pullin that heat and beat 'em
Get your pump and we kill 'em all until we rise
If you're feelin me
Pick up your shit,nigga
Cause it's realer than realer,
than realer,than realer,than realer than 
most of them niggas
you're rollin with them niggas,hoes
And I'm knowin this
Pump up the revolution
Nigga,we go when you come
Join us in a battle and victory
Go down in history
This ain't no mystery
Fuck 'em
Let the law end
Cause we simply get the raw end
Coffins open
Dump 'em all in
We can get down on them po-po
When we finished 
They ain't trippin no more
Get ready 
Leave one of us (?)
So my troopers got something to hope for
When we rumble,crash,collide
Now we lockin up the enemy
What that guy did to me was crude and rude
And don't give a fuck about rules
We done been screwed
Been runnin the streets to long
We know every corner,cut,and alley
So when you're patrollin 
don't pull over the wrong Caddy
Never knowin what's on our minds
Were steadily bustin at these po-po
For the hard times

Chorus

Money,money,money
Shit don't be funny when you ain't got no 
money (money,money)
Bein rich is the shit cause you live so
lovely (lovely,lovely)
Never have to worry 
About where you gon sleep or be hungry 
(hungry,hungry)
But that's only if you got money 
(money,money)
Ooh,ooh,ooh
If murda makes me richer
Then ill be a killa

Chorus",Won't Ez up Tonight

[Krayzie]
This is combat - I don't think these niggaz really know
This shit is for real, this is not a game
So all my real motherfuckin thugs get the fuck up
And put ya guns in the motherfuckin air
And bust the motherfuckers like ya just don't care
And fuck the motherfuckin police
And kill all the motherfuckin enemies!

[Krayzie]
Nigga come a little closer, let me show you a ho
What's up, bitch we can roll
Anybody want to fuck with me, cause I'm down to fuck back with you
What you want to do, huh, huh?
You say you want to fight us, come fight us
We do it 'cause it's real fuck a title
It's all about survival, dedicated to my rivals
And you could die ho
What they talkin bout, Bone Thugs ran
Nigga we never ever run from no man
And fear none
If you see a clique of niggaz get the big gun
Pop one, spend a hun', bet the bitch run
He said he came to get some, nigga, he ain't really want none
Don't let them suckas fool ya (Nigga he ain't really want none)
Bustas won't do too much
I'll knock you out
That dumb shit comin out ya mouth'll get ya nothin but a rematch
Why these niggaz gotta lie?
They can't stand up and face the facts
Nigga your head got cracked
We heard what they said
Said that my niggaz fled
But y'all niggaz know what's up
What? y'all want to shed more blood?
Shit, then come on

(Chorus)
World War
World War
World War
World War (Now you know, now you know)

[Krayzie]
Nigga, bet our niggaz comin to bring the pain
Better bring ya hard hat
Nigga protect ya brain, get a gun and bang bang
Tell me when ya really want to battle
My nigga, 'cause we can handle that
Any way you want to handle static
Nigga, thugstyle, buckwild
Some tear-up-the-club shit, whatever drop down
When the bullets get to jumpin around
The playa haters on the ground, bleedin
The 9-millimeter
Hit him and he drop like, uh!
Could it be ya life has been took?
No, not by the bullet
But the nigga with the heater
I'm trigger happy, I'll be in demand
I'm in command
So let's move, now you know what the enemy look like
The clones that look and sound like Bone
Give a motherfucka more than Speedknots
And when he run up to get punked, give a nigga lumps
y'all niggaz ain't mobsters
Cause if this was the mob, somebody would've been shot ya
But we can get the hole out ya
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh Bone
Too strong for niggaz to hold on, to keep up
But I see ya still want to be us
No matter who was claimin it first
It's who's the realest (realest)
Do not enlist if you not ready for war

I'm representing motherf***ing Thugline n**** (1999)
Motherf***ers want to find the real thugs and hustlers, n**** (f***ing b****es)
Come to the motherf***ing ghetto where we from n****
Now where the real thugs?

(And that one's for my thugster, thugster, thugster)

[Krayzie Bone]
N**** these days we killing much quicker to get us some paper, ya feeling me?
These days you got to be packing a gun everybody your enemy
These days it's every n**** for they self
Cause it ain't no such thing as friends
And well, so nice n****z get left
And that's cause these days you got to be raw out here on the streets
Tell 'em these days you can't be f***ing with n****z that's weak
And these days no telling when you'll meet your coffin
I seen it too often that's why f*** flossing; I take caution
Don't trip, s*** if your rich your rich
Cause if you slip somebody waiting to get
At you grab ya cash and split ya s***
These days stay in the low low and away from po-po
Unless you ready to pull your fo' fo' and blow (OH!)
How come these days n****z want to be the don of the mob?
They claim it but they never qualify for the job
These days we busting at motherf***ers quicker
Simply 'cause its 1999 n**** (n**** n**** n****)

Ay yo I'm straight out of the bricks and y'all ain't worthy to serve me
I'm the type that jump out your bushes and bust you with a 30, 30
You want beef? I pack pistol packing utilities
I'm the type of n**** that'll send letter bombs to all my enemies
I can't even walk the airport for being who I was
Police all on my dick because they recognize a thug
N**** we trying to get money, we don't respect the police
Until us thugs unite it ain't gon' never be no peace
N****z be going to school with nothing but murder on they minds
Giving a f*** about teachers busting shot guns and nines
Picture the scenes and screams and everybody running
Get on your knees and pray n**** cause the son of the lord is coming

[Asu]
You know what came in time that's my frame of mind
Now I'm able to separate the deaf from the weak, dumb and the blind
N****z can't get none of mine, not even some of mine
Just cause you got on a watch n**** don't mean you know the time
You stagnating, you fags hating my motion
From ocean to ocean my magic potion is devotion
The nerve to hate what I deserve to do wasn't a curse it was a signal
That's why that a** crashed for got to put on your blinker
R-W-I: rolling while infatuated
I graduated, now I want my master
Y'all done agitated disaster
And at every ends I start I slip in the art with my heart and soul
And start to roll but dumb to come
Don't become the one I fold like the lawn chair
You shouldn't have gone there
What's the deal with the long stares?
What's the purpose? Jokers on earth surface to surface
And any problem is handled the same day as service (what what what what)

We run the blocks stop the clocks turning rocks and dice
Set trip it's our spot gave y'all shots and let the drama pop
Don't escalate the 4-5-9 just try me dead or alive
Point of survival let's get points with real n****z lives
But you only see raw meat on streets; these n****z love their heat
Nowadays all busters want to thug like me you see it be
Wasn't way so simple execution style pull the gristle
From the chair heard 'em whistle for my n**** mental
It's money, murder, riding dumping heads back to all of y'all
Since every n****'s all hard and proving they got the bigger balls
Scared of the laws told what he saw and what it looked like
Broke him off in the midnight I spared his life I said this s*** is tight

Screaming bloody murda mo all day
The buckshots spray daily all day

Boy, I gots to stack my plate
Bad news travels fast

Real mashers always mask
Give a dog a bone send him on he bound
To come home with some cash

I'm tired of hustlin

This shit ain't easy, this is all I know
What am I supposed to do now? huh?

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

It was you and me against the world
We switched the game up
Hustlin' forever together before we came up
It changed our paths we went our separate ways
No more ridin' on them niggaz for me, how I miss those days
Swore up and down you was a super thug, so it's told
But had compassion for your foes wit'cha heart of gold
While I was rappin' and singing you started slangin' and bangin'
But with money comes greed saw your heart it was changin'
Niggaz out on the street, your peeps gettin covered in sheets
You relied on heat to keep you from suffering defeat
And now you're different like these savages, you're soul golfed out
I know you're hurtin' everytime I see your soul from you
You at your crossroads, whatcho gonna do?
Where you going, boo?
Street is watchin' just to take your soul from you
Who will feed your seed if you're locked down, or better yet dead?
Did you live your life to the fullest when you take your last breath?
Do you know?

Do you know where you're goin' to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin' you?

Come follow me into my life, my life, my life
I'm a young hustla
This is to get paid as I stay clean away from bustas
Strugglin' is in my blood
Mentality thug, reality I'm fucked up
I gotta go get it my goddamn self, cause ain't nobody about to give me shit
Gotta go out and get the rent pay
So I'ma be out here on this block with these rocks and this glock
Until I profit could you stop it?
Mama used to say ""but until I see it better, it got to be this way""
And it don't look like I be going nowhere, nowhere
Looks like I'm stuck in this here ghetto
Even though I done got this dream of being famous
This is really short, and if I don't make it by the end of the year
Shit's feelin' to be changin' I'ma be dangerous, bangin' nigga's brain
Nigga, I'ma start sharin' my pain and bang
Hey, this shit we do for the dollar, dollar bill y'all
So, before I get killed y'all
I gotta make better ain't tryin hustle forever, ever

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things the streets it's showin you?
Do you know, you Can't Hustle Forever?

God, please I know you see me livin' better that this
But, truthfully it's hard for Dre to comprehend cause it's cheddar to get
If I don't hustle I can't eat
So in these streets it's you and me
Takin' these fair penitentiary chances
Plus some real finances that'll (?) me and my fam to better circumstances
Rider quote ""man even though I know I know how this game go""
Got the green light for cash and I can't let time pass
Gotta grabs mines reality's a mutha
Tryin' to hold on to all my survivin' thugs brothas
See, this life'll make you sharp and hard two clenched fists for the struggle
Ride for my thug nation that love to hustle hard
With slugs from berettas, doing dirty business
Some niggaz still can't get together collecting figgas
Make it impossible to hustle forever
But life's a struggle we gonna survive until something come along better

[Chorus: repeat 2x]
Everybody want to be thugs
They really don't cause if they lived my life they'd understand
Niggaz for they self, no love
And it ain't nothin better than a gun in hand

[Verse 1: Krayzie]
I'm lookin at all my niggaz on the corner still trying to come up on something
Like some paper, cash money
Two-double-o-zero, niggaz is desperate to make it
Battlin Satan, but the plate that he made us looks so tasty
Temptation over took my devils persuasion
Makin me chase the paper while trying to break 'em, I blaze 'em
Then I raise up, nigga that's the way thugs do it
See it don't say nothin just to find out we kinda stupid
In the streets we play for keeps
Niggaz ain't comin back for revenge or whatever, loc
We havin none of that, so scandalous
You better keep your protection
Cause the grass and the blunts ain't the only thing we wet up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
See, I've been runnin from the po-po ever since I was 11
Nigga bellin, ain't tryin to get kept and slept in the cell, man
A lot like my daddy, but then again I'm like myself
Keep my nose in my business and worry about nobody else
Got a mind of my own aside from Bone
So nigga don't think that you can run up and test me when I'm alone
Cause I got the chrome
Talk mo' shit I'm still a street thug, but I make mo' hits (mo' hits)
Platinum packin magnum never leave the house without it
And if he bout it don't sing about it nigga bring up out that shit
Thugline, frontline
Nigga it ain't scared, we done time
Leatherface is on the rampage, murder mangler, strangler
What you came with it just ain't enough
To tame the thug, we aim to drain the blood from your skull
Rappin but we dangerous, dangerous

[Chorus: repeat 2x]

[Verse 3: Krayzie]
Now to my youngsters with they guns
Out on the corner perfomin tryna to be soldiers
Just remember that I told ya, slow down, down, down
I know you want to be a thug, and do what we done
But if it ain't inside your blood then this ain't the game that you tryin to
play
Just like one of my niggaz tried to hang, and he died in a day
Awww, shame, shame, shame
Bullet hit him in the brain
And he was a thug nigga, you get the picture?
Picture niggaz in a single file line
All crying, upset because their niggaz died, nobody know why
It's so many dying cause too many trying to shine
We all trying to swang on the same godamned vine
It's about that time for the thugs to unite
And let this motherfucka burn tonight (tonight, night)
If you a thug get up and join this thug nation (thug nation)
We got guns waitin (guns waitin)
Soon as the enemy run up, blaze 'em (blaze 'em)

That's my life

[Krayzie Bone]
Man since I been off in this music business shit has gotten crazy 
I gotta be dealing wit devils bitches and bustas daily
All ah dem was screamin to take me on that long ride
Journey or mission, whatever you want to call it
they tryin to get me Listen,
I'm hearing voices sayin Kill dem muthaphukkaz dead
Other voices saying be humble man and understand
I try to be level headed but it seems the devils winnin
try to do the right thing but I always end up sinnin
Pin Me
God won't forgive you when you pray and do the same shit
So I repent, and you can't even pay yo rent
If it ain't no dollars ain't no sense right now
But as I stop and think, a nigga got kids right now
And mine got ta eat
But they can't eat if daddy's dead or in jail
So, what would you do choose heaven or hell
If it's hell, you'd probly come up fast, and die
That's why {and i} I wonder why heaven 
ain't the chance on my mind

Made me some profits, so nigga tonight my people gonna be eatin on lobster
Hate to say it, but I think these streets done really created a monster
Cause now that I see how quick I can come about breakin the law

Got me a cold ass broad, and that's something I never had
But I'm never mad cause I done snagged one bad one with my young ass
Once I turned 18 it was on
But my brother started writing home, tellin me to leave this shit alone
I say, what? nigga, he don't know that I'm too deep in this
I'm livin and breathin the street shit
And if I don't play the crook, you ain't gonna have shit on your books
Look, gimme a minute, I'll chill in a minute I promise I will
As soon as I finished this last load
I'ma drop the dice after this last roll
Little did he know, I got no intentions on leavin this shit here
I'm feelin to get rich here
When you get out, you'll have some shit here if you still care
Made enough money to move my moms and pops to a new pad
They was suspicious, but they ain't trippin
cause this more shit than we ever had
But shit went bad six in the morning crashing through my door was the Feds
And they want that bread we want you, and I'm like ooh! (shit)
Shoulda listened to my brother, huh?
But I'm like fuck it now

Water, don't need none let it burn
Let it be known that it's my turn, let 'em turn
Be concerned with these words I got
Whatever they sayin about the Line, we better kill 'em
'Cause I got up and I got mine don't mean I'm trippin
Really left niggaz behind to handle business

Thug out with a crowd full of criminals and killers
So pump your fists if ya feel it, hear me
We in it to keep it the realest
With my remige, Thugline team, coming to kill something
Close to 30 million sold and still thuggin, still strugglin

We came up from poor, and I'm not going back to poor, no!

For The Love Of $, I keep it funky
Just thuggin back down in the ghetto
Sleep in the PJ's they let me so I love 'em back
By keepin it real, givin 'em shit that they can feel, like hustlin need more than a mil
Like how to make it on these streets and not be killed â??fore you get grown
Let a nigga go on 'cause he chose to live his life wrong
All I know is life is already short
And you can bring your non-exsistance closer if you want
Trust me, you don't nigga, live on, get'cha thug on (thug on)
Make you some cheese, get some weed and go get your buzz on
But must of all you gotta stay sucka-free, them bustas out ya mix
That go for anything you do and they go all to jail, I don't trip
I share a hater to the side, devil ass nigga
Always fuckin up my vibe, that's right now, nigga

And I don't think you want to though, no!

Chickenhead bitch from Miami said we was runnin when the war popped
Hoe stop, you don't know none nigga rollin with me

Speak louder than a whisper, oh and we gonna get'cha

Together we ride by night, unidentified, unseen, unknown
Yes we are the pirates
Our missin is to destroy enemies by any means necessary
And those who interfere with prosecution for execusion
Shall indeed be terminated any race be gone
For we are the Kneight Riduz
Killers of the night and first of our kind

[Chorus - 2x]
Can't you feels the temperature droppin gettin cold?
Below zero murda mo go slow flow under your door
Is it magic? not it's murda they don't know that we're pirates
By night we get violent like fighters fightin

[Verse - 1]
You're takin chances runnin around upon me
I got somethin waitin in a cage for you
Wipe that smile off your face when you see us ridin through
Killin 'em all (till everyone fall)
You get out of my way or you're subject to get killed without the clues
I thought people should continues bouncin
A war right now is not what you're really wantin
Pirates got the world on lockdown, we rule from the darkness
We come from beneath the ground, so who wants to party?
We got runnin up with slugs for everybody
Renovate the town in blood with a slaughter
What's the matter? you're not soundin so tough
Am I callin your bluff?
When them high tides come crashin ashes to ashes and dust to dust
We are the pirates, the pirates
Yes we are the pirates, pirates

[Chorus - 2x]

[Verse - 2]
want to come fuck with me?
Me bloody matey got me back so check your tick-tock
How many minutes ya got before you drop? been shot
The smell of gun powder fills the air
(????) there you beg for mercy we don't care
Bloody bodies stacked up in a pile and set the fire
It's the pirates behind all this violence it's not the devil
It's rebellin with my shovel, with my victims lifeless
Tossed over my shoulder as I showed him to his hell-hole
Dead foes to the bottom
Us pirates be heartless my conscious was fuckin with me I shot him
And got 'em all believe me
We gonna (??) crazy and i'm silent until my other mode
We front the underland understand, understand?
We live to die so we fear no man not at all
Everytime we call stay outta the way and outta the dark
And just hope to god, that he'll just come and kill us all
We all gonna dies, it's the ways of life wildest new generation pirates
Us new generation pirates, pirates, us new generation pirates, pirates

[Chorus - 2x]

Up in my temple proceddin i'm waitin to taste your blood run throught my veins
And see you gasping out my name

And whenever it is, I think I see

Will I ever make it through the day?

It's so hard to believe that I'm still living, I'm alive
My clock is still ticking, guessing that God is still with me (with me)
'Cause I could have been gone so many times before
Murda Mo is chasing me I'm barely escaping it
My instincts is tellin' me that I might not live long in my life (my life)
My life is a jungle I really don't love it it's really to crumble
I fight with these devils on daily basis
And I try to stay humble
Try not to fall, but what if I slip, trip?
Try to stay calm, but what if I flip?
Kill 'em all
Last night I had a long talk with myself (myself)
Drama had a nigga wondering, wondering how close am I to hell
Then I had to pray can't let them brake me, awww nah, awww nah
But it's everyday they try to make me soft
But so fried, so high is my mistake
Don't worry when I'm in the clouds
Well that's how I stay (stay)

'Cause I know I've popped shots that don't stop
They don't stop
Soon as I lose it they know I get stupid
Ain't nowhere to you, to you
Stop, stop, look, look, listen
Where heard them
I'm hearin' they put to get me (get me)
Can't let 'em get me
I won't stop dumpin' until my clique is empty (empty)

Squattin and schemin plottin on demon
And It's a whole lot of semen in this dick
Packin bisquit, once the bisquits is baked
It boils down to the risk us niggaz take
Try Asu and leave ya loable to get floored
And if you ain't fully insured you ain't just asleep, nigga snore

Freeze everything, nigga don't move
You can choose to be a fool and try to get away
But never make it out the room when the pump go BOOM!
Fuckin 'em up, scream ""fuck the world"" while I cuff my nuts
Real niggaz don't lie, hit 'em in the mind, everytime goddamn we live
Send 'em to the graveyard, who gonna save y'all?
Matter of fact motherfucka who paid y'all
You runnnin up on them niggaz you know gonna bust back?
Take no more shorts fuck that (fuck that)
Pistol control, we roll streets of the all know
If they run up I'll pop get your hand out my pocket
For the glock, glock shot 'em all on the floor
You dealin with some motherfuckin real niggaz
Thrill niggaz, we'll kill niggaz if they want to kill me
Still runnin with the AK-47 ain't shit changed
Still got the same artilary
Bust at them bastards (bastard)
Me and Boss steady breakin it off in they asses (in they ass)
want to see me get glasses (glass)
Cause I be all in your face but you walk right past me (past me)
But that let a niggaz know they don't really want to swang them thangs
Fuckin wit them thugs, the thugs... nigga the thugs, what?

[Chorus: x2]

Bare witness to Mrs. Gangsta
We're gun-toaters, blunt smokers, big bank folders, and high rollers
Quick to burn off into toaster for fun, this bitch
Judges want to post as gorilla
Pimps, killers, and soldiers roll
You don't slip and we thought that we told ya
Know what Thug Luv nigga to bone ya
They can run your shit and bend a corner, scatter and spread
Like mustard jam them buzzards up and leave 'em smothered
Quick friends gats find ya like bookie and they down with me like fo' flat
y'all niggaz got nuts, our niggaz got nuts

So we can go nut for nut see who first to crack and split
Like ya down like wipers
'Fore the motherfuckin piper pay the bitch

You motherfuckas feelin to feel it
Thugline put it down keepin it the real it
And I ain't really trippin of these niggaz
They say they gonna get me yet they miss me
(What?) Cause I've been here niggaz thuggin
Waitin for you motherfuckas to come bring it to me
Fuck waitin I'ma mingle with it
The nine millimeter and plenty more haters
If any more niggaz roll up put the cut I'm fuckin 'em up
When I hit 'em with the pump don't duck you gonna die
Fuck you, die, buck you, die
Reload, unload one more time
Hit him with the pump make sure he dead

Ask me if a nigga prepared for war hell yeah

But check it out (thugs!) i'm through with trippin
That's why I got on my mission and did this
Handled my business, witness your nigga come up on these millions
Really I been in the cut now for quite a while
When I come out, niggaz gonna recognize the tighter style

[Chorus]
Time after time, find I question my life
How I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise?  Will I fall?  Stand tall
Continue asking, but I'm knowing only God know

Time after time, find I question my life
Where I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise?  Will I fall?  Stand tall
Continue asking, but I'm knowing only God know

[Verse One]
Growing up in the hood as a hard knock
I never knew nothing too much about young
My only concern was making my money and running these streets as a thug
Instead of the birds and bees, I always talk to murderers and the G's
That coldness inside me, but I ain't trying to hurt nobody
Temptation is keeping me steadily going under
And I wonder, if I could make it through the thunder
Cause I done caused so much hurt and pain to some that ain't deserve a thang
If I could change that, it would all be rearranged
But what's done is done and I paid the price
and now I'm like, Help me Lord, to better my life, my life
Just give me the chance to prove the world that I can be the man that I am
And I plan, on keeping it realer, really slow and steady

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
So now I'm headed to the chapel and I'm fin' to try marriage
It's goin' down yeah, yeah, yeah, but what do ya know?
Who woulda knew that would make situations worse
And my curse, nothing I've tried seems to work
And I drop to my knees and I pray, yes I pray
And I wonder if I'll ever see a better day  (I need a better day)
I've seen much in my time and I think it was too much for my eyes
The wickedness pulling me closer to failure everytime I think I'm rising, yeah
But you live and you learn and try to make better, gotta get control
Then follow the Lord and who knows where you'll go, for sho'
I can see how I've been sinnin
I'm asking the Lord for a little bit of forgiving, 'giving

Especially in this game

[Verse 1: Krayzie]
Excuse me, but do you know me?
You've seen me on TV and in the video
Got caught up in Crossroads forgot that we was criminals
That's right, we them same niggas to come up from nothing
To what up with them figures?
Nigga, my album got better things
And people changed when I got in the game
Niggas call me I don't even know how you know my name?
How the fuck you get my number?
What the fuck is going on?
Then I got these haters leaving threats on my phone
They messages be records that they made just for me
I'm not on that don't give a fuck if you rap faster than me
But when it come to being the realest niggas that ever did it
You know Bone Thugs gonna be contending for that position
Listen, if why y'all niggas want to trip with us, 
Bomb ya fall with you dick in the dust
Get up, what up? Thought ya had me figured out you didn't
Remember next time, that last time that nigga wasn't bullshitting

Homie, why y'all don't know me
Why y'all might of heard my name once or twice
Don't start none (drama), won't be none (drama)
Cause however they want it, they can come get it believe I got it
Can't be faded keep thinking Krayzie ain't really crazy
Haters, that pressing me to make me show this lately
Afraid that they mistaken that they thinking Kray ain't hip, hip, hip
To those who pose as friends
But are phony before they can infiltrate but can't imitate us for long
They better not come talking no shit cause I'm serving 'em some
And fuck what you heard, believe what you see please
Dap is cheap, dramatical action speaks
Did you hear it, hear it?
I know ya feel it, feel it the twelve gauge eruption

We got a game full of clones that can't hold they own
So they be fast to bite
Nigga don't like Bone, then why the fuck you rapping like me bastard
You know you like it, niggas funny
Be bobbin they head to my music, but when they see me they mean mugging
Keep looking ugly, niggas but jut don't jump
Cause I'm a nervous nigga, and I'll buck, buck, buck
Thug haters they get me violent
Cops make me riot
You bitches make me sick and tired, sin keeps me wide up
And I needs to be high, just for fucking with why y'all
And I dedicate this one to all them busters I knew would fall
Had to get rid of the dead weight that was holding me down (holding me down)
The Thugline officials and it's going down (down)
So wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dog
No need, don't even try to fade us, why y'all
Who the nigga in the halls, big balls?

Woke up this morning in a cemetery kinda weary
Looked over my shoulder and I seen somebody just been freshly buried
Was kinda scary 'cause my shirt was soaked in blood man
Shovel in my hand so I had to be the one that dug that
But I had no knowledge
I don't remember even leavin' the house man
Can't explain how I got here
It's like I was walkin' but I was unconscious
But I had to be wallin'
'Cause I seen the bloody machete ah
It was used on the victim to shred him up
Oh my god don't tell me I
Oh shit
Something's going wrong I don't know what's going on
All I know was I was home then I woke up here alone
Wondering who was in that hole I ain't stickin' around to know
My mind is blank and I'm so cold and I don't know which way to go
Runnin' in the rain
I'm barely breathin' more like wheezin'
Runnin' in the rain
How could this be what I was heavin'
I made it to my house I closed the blinds and shut the door
Somebody please tell me what's going on 'cause I don't fuckin know

I want to hurt you I don't know why
I want to hurt you I don't know why
I want to hurt you I don't know why
I want to hurt you I don't know why

Jumped in the shower washed the blood from off my body
Rolled up a blunt I'm feeling psychotic mixed me up some ginentonic
But I'm nauseous feeling woozy like I'm in the twilight zone the movie
How did I do it how did I get through it
And I wondered if anyone knew what I was doing
Sat down and clicked on the tube
Flipped to the news I'm trying to find answers
Who's body is on my hands and how did the situation get so drastic
Its madness
And I just can't take no more I passed out
Couldn't help but crash out from last night I'm dashed out
Slept for a minute but I didn't sleep to long before
I was awakin' by some heavy bangin' on my door
It was the popo 'cause inside they shined their flashlights
Gotta funny feeling this has something to do with last night
They tried to tell me that I'm wanted for kidnap and murder
Tellin' me they got proof that I murdered my ex-employer
Don't think my lawyer can help me with this one
I grabbed my pistol put the clip in
And I'm out the back window
I'm gone.",Don't Know Why

Spitting verses that come thirsty for more, so I split

Now look who's back on the scene, the lyrical genius Krayzie

drowning a bottle of Gin, I got to
So a speech is slurring, and I see a blurry vision

Where the gangstas at? Where the ballers at? Where the
brawlers at? Where my dogs is at?
where them niggaz that don't give a fuck about

Never run and I stand with a gun in my hand
If you want it, come get it, we got it, this beef
inside, we ready, come bring it, come on

y'all better get outta my way, it's Kray, Leatherface
in the place, finna blow up just like a grenade
Give me pay nigga, don't try to play with my paper
this year cause I swear I'm gonna act like my name
Got a gauge and K that'll blaze in the same
Ya don't really want to play with me man
But I'ma be ready on any day, y'all just be ready for plenty pay
I bet 'cha I fade any sucka as soon as it pop
Making 'em drop, shaking the spot
One simple shot and they feel the shit done with, plus
I got something for them niggaz that come with
Run quick when my gun spit, and I bust this out in
public, on some thug shit, who the thug bitch? That'll
be T-H-you-G-L-I-N-E and yes, we be

I look at my life and I realize I don't want to let go
No, I'm tryin' to survive I don't want to die I'm searchin' the best road
Never playin' myself, I'm playin' with death
Nigga y'all better wake up to livin' and appreciate the life ya givin'
Oh no I don't, want to go, not now man
There's too many things a nigga got planned so much to understand
Still so many goals for me to achieve in, please believe in
It's rough but still that ain't a reason, to stop ya breathin'
They ask if a nigga was scared to pass away
And I'm tellin' 'em, ""Hell yeah, I can't hug my babies if I drift and slept in Hades""
It's crazy how niggaz be killin' be sayin' they ready to die
You ready to die? I'm ready to live nigga, grow up wit my kids nigga
Ain't takin' no chances on no after life
Because there's only death after life
So I be spending my time, tryin' to stay alive
If I gotta live and let die

Now that we livin' in a world full of war and murder
But money makes the world go round and round
Everybody killin' everybody what's that sound?
How many make the heat that buck come buck 'em on down
May we all rest in peace
Looks like we gon' all rest in peace
The world R.I.P

[Verse 3]
Now everybody want to go to heaven, but nobody want to die
And that don't make sense
But let me tell ya that I know of a place where, we can go and just chill (for real)
No more crime, no more strain
No more die, no more pain
No more wasting our lives away
Got to pray, got to pray, got to pray, got to pray
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
And if ya fall, be sure to ride and everything's gonna be alright
Just keep ya eyes on ya prize
And maybe you'll make it up out of this life
We all die so young, victims of the gun
A poverty to harmony and then it marks us
My nigga you ready to end it, potnah speak for yourself
I'm down with life, and everything else to hell with death

Hey young thug, it seems you got yourself

Now your drifting away and blowing all of your ambitions away
don't throw it all away
Your not a name, your just a number
feeling like don't nobody love ya
want to hug ya to stop ya from going under, uh-uh
I know sometimes that we may praise this life
but I'm here to tell ya that we all paod the price, so move on
And don't believe everything you be hearing on them
songs, cause sometimes the Devil can get in there and steer ya wrong

Now this one's for my ghetto queens in the slammer
convicted now as criminals, caged up like animals
These real women stuck in this wicked prison system
look how ya living, you should be home raising your children
But your messing with that sucka that got you hooked
on wine, booked doing crime and he shook, blew your mind
Now daylight come but you can't go home
and all over the world it's the same old song
same song, same song

{Hook 4x}

Now this one's for my partners doing they time in the pen
doing 5 or to 10, tell, or 25 with an L
Never coming home no more, end up your life

Finna guess you paid the price, can't hug ya wife
You can't even kiss ya kids and tell 'em you love 'em
won't be there to cover 'em
And nothing is worst than being away from your loved ones

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Low screams of the survivors the innocent have paid

After the attack deformed mutants psychical confusion
After the attack nuclear winter in the land

Fear is controlling all actions kill to survive
The scarlet sky is the witness of all as the mutants arrive
Between ruins rotting corpses lie the smell of burning bones
All hope is in vain as death is creeping through the stones

The only way out without pain is quick suicide
All live in hell and fear

[I gave this song a new title since it is the first version of ""Winter Martyium"", only available on the ""Renewal"" demo. Listening to the song today I wonder why it did not make it onto the album. Especially the lyrics are cool since they deal with the typical autumn/winter depression I have to go through every year of my life. The drumming is amaz-ing, respect to Ventor at this point.]

Passing of perception unforseen reaction
Staring out the window into the ice cold air
Memories of summer causing my depression
Through concentrated death and rainfall of despair
Visionary eden turns to hell

Winter martyrium
Freezing me from inside
Pastlife delirium
As my tears turn to ice

Snow the white empress, frost the ice cold forest
At mountains of dead bodies I drank the sweetest wine
Spring awaits lust for the autumn dominatress
Life remains a dream within a dream visionary symbols

Summer's gotta come bringing back the sun
Zero to none, winter awaits us all
Mystic awareness

With God conversing wide awake in your sleep
Shining discovery mankind martyrium
Planets of terror, hatred and deceit
To live it means to suffer to die to live forever
I'm left here with the others we could not die together
And as I saw them dying I knew it had begun
Emotional massacre

When death takes it's dominion

Everything dies",When Death Takes It's Dominion
Kreator,"Let there be darkness
Let there be blood tonight
Let there be riots
Come start the fires tonight

Can't you see, our people have got no choice
But to fight them back
Can't you see, the change of consciousness
Demands a total attack
Total attack
Total... attack!

Finally they're swarming in a long forgotten youth
The cause of inequality, a paradise for few
Superior, inferior, a vast insanity
When justice is tyranny
Anarchy is breaking out, destruction marks it's way
Burning temples turning into dark crypts of decay
The mighty are the fallen now, the weak are on the hunt
Battle on many fronts

There will be darkness
There will be blood tonight
Now let the riots begin
Convulsed by protest
And civilization collapse

Monumental terror spreading like a pestilence
From suburbs to the center of colossal arrogance
Cascade of aggression merely harvest seeds of hate
Storming the barricades
Cities of inception burn into the ashes in one night
Imperators crying at this grand historic sight
Entering a death spiral, tonight they see their fate
Doomed to reincarnate

There will be darkness
There will be blood tonight
So let the riots begin
A social unrest
And civilization collapse",Civilization Collapse
