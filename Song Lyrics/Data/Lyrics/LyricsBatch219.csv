Joy Division,"Two ways to choose,
On a razor's edge,
Remain behind,
Go straight ahead

Room full of people, room for just one,
If I can't break out now, the time just won't come

Two ways to choose,
Which way to go,
Decide for me,
Please let me know

Looked in the mirror, saw I was wrong,
If I could get back to where I belong, where I belong

Two ways to choose,
Which way to go,
Had thoughts for one
Designs for both

But we were immortal, we were not there,
Washed up on the beaches, struggling for air

I see your face still in my window,
Torments yet calms, won't set me free,
Something must break now,
This life isn't mine,
Something must break now,
Wait for the time,
Something must break",Something Must Break
Joy Division,"See my true reflection,
Cut off my own connections,
I can see life getting harder,
So sad is this sensation,
Reverse the situation,
I can't see it getting better.

I'll walk you through the heartbreak,
Show you all the out takes,
I can't see it getting higher,
Systematically degraded,
Emotionally a scapegoat,
I can't see it getting better.

Perverse and unrealistic,
Try to make it all sick,
I can't see it getting better,
Hollow now, I'm burned out,
All I need to break out,
I can't see life getting higher,
Love, life, makes you feel higher,
Love, of life, makes you feel higher,
Higher, higher, higher, higher,
Higher, higher, higher, higher,
Love of life, makes you feel higher.",Sound of Music

Listen to the silence, let it ring on
Eyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sun
We would have a fine time living in the night
Left to blind destruction
Waiting for our sight

And we would go on as though nothing was wrong
And hide from these days we remained all alone
Staying in the same place, just staying out the time
Touching from a distance
Further all the time

Joy Division,"This is a crisis I knew had to come
Destroying the balance I'd kept
Doubting, unsettling and turning around
Wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live?
I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard
It all falls apart at first touch

Watching the reel as it comes to a close
Brutally taking it's time
People who change for no reason at all
It's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events?
Disturbing and purging my mind
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done
I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God given ways
Safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
Left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give?
Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more
And watch as they drop by the beach

This is the crisis I knew had to come
Destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives
Wondering what will come next

Joy Division,"This is the room, the start of it all,
No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall,
I've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain,
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained.

Where will it end?  Where will it end?
Where will it end?  Where will it end?

These are your friends from childhood, through youth,
Who goaded you on, demanded more proof,
Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in,
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin.

Where will it end?  Where will it end?
Where will it end?  Where will it end?

This is the car at the edge of the road,
There's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closed,
I guess you were right, when we talked in the heat,
There's no room for the weak, no room for the weak,

Where will it end?  Where will it end?
Where will it end?  Where will it end?

This is the room, the start of it all,
Through childhood, thorugh youth, I remember it all,

Joy Division,"Morning seems strange, almost out of place.
Searched hard for you and your special ways.
These days, these days.

Spent all my time, learnt a killer's art.
Took threats and abuse 'till I'd learned the part.
Can you stay for these days?

These days, these days.

Used outward deception to get away,
Broken heart romance to make it pay.

These days, these days.

We'll drift through it all, it's the modern age.
Take care of it all now these debts are paid.
Can you stay for these days?",As You Said

Joy Division,"Don't speak of safe messiahs
Failure of the modern man
To the center of all life's desires
As a whole not an also ran
Love in a hollow field
Break the image of your father's son
Drawn to an inner feel
He was thought of as the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the modern man
He no longer picks sides
Sees the failures of the modern man
Wise words and sympathy
Tell the story of our history
New strength gives a real touch
Sense and reason make it all too much
With a strange fatality
Break the spirits of a lesser man
Some other race can see
In his way he was the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the modern man
No, no he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the modern man
Now that it's time to decide
In his time he was a total man
Taken from Caesar's side
Kept in silence just to prove who's wrong
No, no he can't despise
All the failures of the modern man
No, no longer denies
All the failures of the modern man",Failures
Joy Division,"No, I don't know just why
No, I don't know just why
Which way to turn
I got this ticket to use
Through childlike ways rebellion and crime
To reach this point and retreat back again
The broken hearts, all the wheels that have turned
The memory's scarred and the vision is blurred

No, I don't know which way
Don't know which way to turn
The best possible use
Just passing through, 'till we reach the next stage
But just to where, well it's all been arranged

Just passing through but the break must be made
Should we move on or stay safely away?

Joy Division,"This is the hour when the mysteries emerge
A strangeness so hard to reflect
A moment so moving, goes straight to your heart
Condition has never been met
The attraction is held like a weight deep inside
Something I'll never forget

The pattern is set, her reaction will start
Complete but rejected too soon
Looking ahead in the grip of each fear
Recalls the life that we knew
The shadow that stood by the side of the road
Always reminds me of you

How can I find the right way to control?
All the conflicts inside, all the problems beside
As the questions arise, and the answers don't fit
Into my way of things, into my way of things",Komakino
Joy Division,"Born from some mother's womb
Just like any other room
Made a promise for a new life
Made a victim out of your life

When your time's on the door
And it drips to the floor
And you feel you can touch
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown
Are no longer your own

Just a minor operation
To force a final ultimatum
Thousand words are spoken loud
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd

When you walk down the street
And the sound's not so sweet
And you wish you could hide
Maybe go for a ride
To some peep-show arcade
Where the future's not made

A nightmare situation
Infiltrate imagination
Smacks of past Holy wars
By the wall with broken laws

The leaders of men
Born out of your frustration
The leaders of men
Just a strange infatuation
The leaders of men
Made a promise for a new life
No savior for our sakes
To twist the internees of hate
Self-induced manipulation
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation",Leaders of Men
Joy Division,"So long sitting here, didn't hear the warning
Waiting for the tape to run
We've been moving around in different situations
Knowing that the time would come
Just to see you torn apart
Witness to your empty heart
I need it
I need it
I need it

Through the wire screen
The eyes of those standing outside looked in at her
As into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo
In the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument
Which they had that morning inserted deep into her body
She shuddered instinctively
No life at all in the house of dolls
No love lost
No love lost

You've been seeing things in darkness, not in learning
Hoping that the truth will pass
No life underground, wasting never changing
Wishing that this day won't last
To never see you show your age
To watch until the beauty fades
I need it
I need it
I need it",No Love Lost
Joy Division,"Confusion in her eyes that says it all
She's lost control
And she's clinging to the nearest passer-by
She's lost control

And she gave away the secrets of her past and said
I've lost control again
And a voice that told her when and where to act, she said
I've lost control again

And she turned around and took me by the hand and said
I've lost control again
And how I'll never know just why or understand, she said
I've lost control again

And she screamed out kicking on her side and said
I've lost control again
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd died, she said
I've lost control again

She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control

Well I had to 'phone her friend to state my case and say
She's lost control again
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes and said
And said I've lost control again

But she expressed herself in many different ways, until
She lost control again
And walked upon the edge of no escape, ang laughed
I've lost control again

She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control

I can live a little better with a message of lies
When the darkness broke in, I said I broke down and cried
I can live a little, say the wanted line
When the day is dull, when the day has come
To lose control",She's Lost Control
Joy Division,"Three, five, zero, one, two, five go!

I was there in the back stage
When the light came around
I grew up like a changeling
To win the first time around
I can see all the weakness
I can pick all the faults
Well, I concede all the faith tests
Just to stick in your throats

Three-one-G
Three-one-G
Three-one-G

Hung around in your soundtrack
To mirror all that you've done
To find the right side of reason

I can see through your eyes
All this talk made no contact
No matter how hard we tried

Three-one-G
Three-one-G

I can still hear the footsteps
I can see only walls
I slid into your man-traps

To make believe you were right

Joy Division,"A cry for help, a hint of anesthesia,
The sound from broken homes,
We used to always meet here.
As he lays asleep, she takes him in her arms,
Some things I have to do, but I don't mean you harm.

A worried parent's glance, a kiss, a last goodbye,
Hands him the bag she packed, the tears she tries to hide,
A cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy
And leaves him standing cold here in this colony.

I can't see why all these confrontations,
I can't see why all these dislocations,
No family life, this makes me feel uneasy,
Stood alone here in this colony.

Joy Division,"I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand,
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
These sensations barely interest me for another day,
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away.

It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand,
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs,  it's a no man's land,
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow.

What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again,
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from you friends,
Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a damn right now,

Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,

Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone.
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables,
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain.

Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden,
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky,
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment,
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside.

Cry like a child, though these years make me older,
With children my time is so wastefully spent,
A burden to keep, though their inner communion,
Accept like a curse an unlucky deal.

My view stretches out from the fence to the wall,
No words could explain, no actions determine,
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall.",The Eternal

Joy Division,"I walked through the city limits,
Someone talked me in to do it,
Attracted by some force within it,
Had to close my eyes to get close to it,
Around a corner where a prophet lay,
Saw the place where she'd had a room to stay,
A wire fence where the children played
Saw the bed where the body lay,
And I was looking for some friends of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

The cars screeched hear the sound on dust,
Heard a noise just a car outside,
Metallic blue turned red with rust,
Pulled in close by the building's side,
In a group all forgotten youth,
Had to think, collect my senses now,
Are turned on to a knife edged view
Find some places where my friends don't know,
And I was looking for a friend of mine,
And had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same,
Getting darker now, faces look the same,

Joy Division,"To the center of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you,
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for you,
I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you,
In a room with a window in the corner I found truth.

In the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no more,
As the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor,
And with cold steel, odor on their bodies mad a move to connect,
But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left.

I let them use you for their own ends,

Joy Division,"So this is permanent, love's shattered pride.
What once was innocence, turned on its side.
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move,
Deep in the memory, of what once was love.

Oh how I realized how I wanted time,
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find,
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way.
Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away.

Excessive flash points, beyond all reach,
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep.
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find,
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires.

I never realized the lengths I'd have to go,
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know.
Just for one moment, I heard somebody call,
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all.

Now that I've realized how it's all gone wrong,
Gottas find some therapy, this treatment takes too long.
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway,
Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late.",Twenty Four Hours

I traveled far and wide through prisons of the cross,
What did you see there?
The power and glory of sin,
What did you see there?
The blood of Christ on their skins,
I traveled far and wide through many different times.

I traveled far and wide and unknown martyrs died,
What did you see there?

Someone talked me in to do it,
Attracted by some force within it,
Had to close my eyes to get close to it,
Around a corner where a prophet lay,
Saw the place where she'd had a room to stay,
A wire fence where the children played
Saw the bed where the body lay,
And I was looking for some friends of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

The cars screeched hear the sound on dust,
Heard a noise just a car outside,
Metallic blue turned red with rust,
Pulled in close by the building's side,
In a group all forgotten youth,
Had to think, collect my senses now,
Are turned on to a knife edged view
Find some places where my friends don't know,
And I was looking for a friend of mine,
And had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.

Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same,
Getting darker now, faces look the same,
And I walked round and round.
No stomach, torn apart,
Nail me to a train.

Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out.

All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know

Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all

Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Got to find my destiny before it gets too late

And I was so lost inside of me
But somehow you'd be right next to me

I had my dreams and you lived them too

Joy Enriquez,"There are days when I regret it
The things I said to you
I put my trust in no one
It broke my heart and I blamed it on you
You were kind and oh so gentle
But I refused to see
That someone like you existed
I was somewhere in denial
While you were loving me

[Chorus]
I cried myself to sleep last night
When I woke up
There were tear stains on my pillow
It hurts so much to sacrifice what I gave up
Without you in my life
I will always feel lonely
Losing the love
From someone like you

Not a day goes by without something
Reminding me of you
The truth is that I miss you
It gets so hard not being with you
There are times when I go crazy
In the twilight of the night
How I long to be your woman again
There's pain that I hold
That will not let me go

I don't wanna make this too hard
But I just wanna be where you are
In your life, by your side, forever

He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what heartache's all about
And what I'm going through

But tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine, 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me

But tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine, 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me

Yes tonight, the heartache's on me",Tonight the Heartache's on Me
Joy Lynn White,"You look so out of place in this little country bar
Don't know the circumstances, but here you are
Go on and run, but you won't get too far
'Cause you can't escape my wild love

I work six nights a week waitin' tables here
Always dreamin' someone like you would appear
Now that I've found you, let me make it clear
That you can't escape my wild love

Somehow you ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
Now that I've got you here, girl, there ain't no turnin' back

We're gonna party till the sun comes up
I'll ride you in my hot pink pick-up truck
If you've got other plans, then you're just out of luck
'Cause you can't escape my wild love

Once your big brown eyes adjust to this soft blue neon light
You'll clearly see the one who's gonna rock your world tonight

We're gonna party till the sun comes up
I'll ride you in my hot pink pick-up truck
If you've got other plans, then you're flat out of luck

No, honey, you can't escape my wild love

You're a leaf that's turning too
We go in opposite directions 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
For the lack of true affection

I'd like to let you go
But my heart can't say goodbye
Sometimes I just don't know
Why we keep this love alive
Why do we keep this love alive
When we barely even try
Give me one good reason why

To keep this love

Oh we use to be together
Now we're just so far apart
Was it all just a dream
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Joy Villa,"This song is for the girl
Who's got no home
She ran away young
'Cause she didn't know how
She didn't wanna get hurt anymore
She cut herself when dad got drunk

Her mama didn't love her
And her daddy didn't want her
And nobody wanted listen to her

This song is for the boy
Who couldn't man up
He got beat up
'Cause he wasn't tough enough

He wanted to impress the girls
So he drew a bunch of tattoos on

And he joined a gang
Started stealing stuff
Head all messed up
But he didn't feel tough

No he didn't feel tough

Tell yourself you're beautiful
You're beautiful
Tell yourself you're beautiful
You're beautiful
Tell yourself you're beautiful, you're beautiful

This for the mama
Gave away her baby
Daddy in jail
Credit cards calling

Burned her friends
And lost her job
And fell into a funk

Her daddy didn't want her
And her mommy didn't love her
And nobody wanted to listen to her

This is for the man
Who's trying to stay a man
In a world of lies
Pushed to the outside
Made a choice
Pressured to hide
They tell his he's despised

Tell yourself you're beautiful
You're beautiful
Tell yourself you're beautiful
You're beautiful
Tell yourself you're beautiful, you're beautiful",Beautiful

I wanna step into the light

And this fire is burning still

I think I could find the will
To stand for every dream
And forsake this solid ground
And give up this fear within
Of what would happen if they ever knew
I'm in love with you

To feel the chance to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too

Another night away from you
You're the reason I go on
And now I need to live the truth
Right now, there's no better time

And I'll live again with love

Joy Whitlock,"Real life, a bright eyed
Wild ride for everyone
Sometimes it flies
Then dives and comes undone

But I have faith
My heart is safe

I'm lifted up, I'm tumbling down
I touch the sky, I hit the ground
But every time I've found
You're holding on to me

Life pushes out it pulls me in
The ride is wilder than the wind
Why would I worry when
You're holding on to me

We spin, reeling
Feeling insecure
But your plan, your hand
Will stand unmoved and sure

So I won't fear
You've made it clear

So I'll take all
The rise and fall
I'm in your grip, I'll never slip
'Cause love won't let me go

",Holding on to Me
Joy Williams,"Is the face that I see in the mirror
The one I want others to see
Do I show in the way that I walk in my life
The love that You've shown me
My heart's desire is to be like You
In all that I do, all I am

[Chorus]
Do they see Jesus in me
Do they recognize Your face
Do I communicate Your love and Your grace
Do I reflect who You are
In the way I choose to be
Do they see Jesus in me

It's amazing that You'd ever use me
But use me the way You will
Help me to hold out a heart of compassionate grace
A heart that You're spirit fills
May I show forgiveness and mercy
The same way you've shown it to me

Now I want to show all the world who You are
The reason I live and breathe
So You'll be the One that they see
When they see me

I remember what You said 
You said You'd never leave me 
But I let go of your hand 
Build my castles in the sand 
But now I'm reaching out again 
And I'm not letting go 'till you... 

Hold me, Mold me 
Sometimes I feel so all alone 
See, I gotta find my way Back Home 
So why don't You Shape me, Make me 
Wash me whiter than the snow 
I gotta find my way...Back Home 

Master upon my knees I pray 
I just want to be the clay 
Put your arms around me 
Place my life in Your hands 
Lord I know I'm just human 
But you understand 
This time I'm not letting go 'till You... 

Hold me, Mold me 
Sometimes I feel so all alone 
See, I gotta find my way Back Home 
So why don't You Shape me, Make me 
Wash me whiter than the snow 
I gotta find my way...Back Home 

'Cause I'm lost and alone 
I've been wandering long enough to know 
Humbly I search for You 
And I'm not gonna rest 'till You... 

Choose me, Use me 
Sometimes I feel so all alone 

I am on my way Back Home 
So why don't You Direct me, Bless me 
Wash me whiter than the snow 
I am on my way...

Ask me to explain it 
And I could (and I could)

And I should (and I should)

Cause even when it seems that it's all bad 
It's All Good 

I wouldn't try to fool you 
I'll be open with this heart of mine 
I wouldn't try to trick you 
Cause I know you'd see right 
Through me every time 
I'm not invincible no, but my faith is real 
I'm hoping I'll convince you when I say

When it comes to me who do I really trust

I want to live my life with no regrets

Not just wishing that I had
Pushin' on and never givin' up
Any less is never gonna be enough
I want to give my all and no less

I want to live my life with no regrets
I'll listen to the call
'Cause You gave it all
So when You put me to the test

I'm gonna give You no less
You felt so much pain
It's hard to believe
You gave so much away

You came to me with nothing to gain
You offered your best

want to show You just what I mean
Doesn't matter what they say

Joy Williams,"It's so typical
I'm always amazed
When it some to You
It feels so natural
To be blown away
When I stop and think of
How Your love was etched upon my heart
And how no matter
If I laugh, If I hope
If I dream, You're a part of me

[Chorus]
Wanting You, needing You
Loving You comes to me
It comes like second nature like
Breathing in, breathing out
Something I don't think about
It comes like second nature
Second nature

Like an instinct 
That I can't control
I always turn to You
It's a spiritual thing
A thirst in my soul
That makes me run
Into your arms and to the place
Our hearts collide where everything comes clear
And I see, from the start
This is how love was meant to be

[Chorus]

It's so obvious
I was born for this
Born for a love like this
And I know for sure
I've been captured
There is no escaping this

Wanting You, needing You, loving You

[Chorus]",Second Nature
Joy Williams,"Do you ever get the feeling
People think you're crazy
Cause you trust what they can't see.
Do you ever get the feeling
People think you're shallow
And you will change what you believe.
But I'm not here to argue
About what others think and feel.
Cause I'm not ashamed to tell anyone
What I know to be real.

[Chorus]
I'm serious about the stand I'm taking
Serious about the choice I'm making
Serious about the things that I believe.
I'm serious about the talk I'm talking.
The evidence is in the walk I'm walking.
Serious about love and purity.
I'm serious as I can be.

I'm not the first to meet with laughter
And resistance from a disbelieving crowd.
But I got to meet it head on.
I'm just gonna keep on
Won't let it get me down.
I'm not here to give up
Jesus didn't give up on me.
Even when the going gets rough
I've promised God that I'll be

[Chorus]

Won't change my mind
Got to close the door.
No time for goin' back
To what I had before.
I'm so tired of playin' all these games.
Cause the more I see what you mean to me
The more I want to say

[Chorus]",Serious
Joy Williams,"Most live a lifetime and never see 
The soul of tomorrow in someone's eyes 
Some give up on all of their dreams 
One second before they materialize 
But love broke through walls of stone 
It was You, it was You alone 

Chorus: 
You crack the sky like broken glass 
You rescued me when my chance had passed 
Sometimes things aren't as hard as you may think 
Because all you need is just a touch of faith 

Some never ever turn a key 
To the door of their heart's desires 
Too afraid to fall somewhere in between 
Tomorrow's fears and the pressure's fire 
Your love broke through walls of stone 
It was You, it was You alone 

Chorus

Your touch pushed back the clouds just like the sun 
Your hand pulled me out of the hardest time 
That I've ever known, that I ever knew 
Oh Lord, that was all because I met You 
Your love broke through walls of stone 
It was You, it was You alone

Go chase it 
If you got a fear, 
Then face it

Don't waste it

While the sky is falling 

Every single day 
That's dawning 
Is another perfect morning 
Got a lot to do, stop yawning 
Listen up, the world is calling 
You know you want to make a difference 
Break the silence On your feet 

People get up 
If you want to be lifted up 
If you want to be looking up 
Do you want to be ready 
To take a stand, put your hand up 
If you want to be waken up 
Do you want to be shaken up 
If you want to be right on the money 
Everybody get up 

Every little thing you're doing 
Every little plan you're brewing 
Everything you're going through 
Gonna make you stronger 
Just remember 
If you ever trip and stumble 
If you ever roll and tumble 
If you ever fall and fumble 
Dust it off, and get back into the moment 
And make a difference 
Break the silence 
On your feet 

When you're feeling down 
Take a look around 
Put your hands up, Put your hands up 
When you're feeling low 
All you need to know 
Put your hands up, 
Put your hands up 
So if you've got the faith 
Let me hear you say

Joy Williams,"Well, I have never been a fashion queen
I wear dresses, I wear jeans
I've even been known to wear my heart on my sleeve
I'm just your average kid next door

A plain, simple mystery
I'm a self proclaimed Daddy?s girl
With my share of idiosyncrasies
But You love me for me

And I'm just fine, I see a smile from Heaven
My Father is proud and I know that I am simply
Fearfully and wonderfully made in You
You make it beautiful somehow

I've got old fashioned sensibilities
I believe chivalry still exists
And I can be a princess
Even when there ain't no prince

So, what if I'm right brained
I've got half a mind to disagree
I would rather write the book
Than go and read the movie

So even when I may not rhyme
You always give me reason

I'm just fine, I see a smile from Heaven
My Father is proud and I know that I am simply
Fearfully and wonderfully made in You
You make it beautiful somehow

Got my elbows on the table
My mind up in the clouds
I know I'm getting better
I can almost hear You laugh out loud

The more I trust in You
The more I find
What You create is no mistake
It?s purpose by design

So, I'm just fine, I see a smile from Heaven
My Father is proud and I know that I am simply
Fearfully and wonderfully made in You
You make it beautiful somehow

Beautiful somehow
That is what you do
Beautiful somehow
Beautiful, beautiful You

I get caught up simply, just surviving from day to day
But in the midst of all the lists to do
I need some help to change my point of view

Every day I'm giving you everything

It ain't no matter what life may bring, I lay it down

'Cause every day you make sense of me
In the midst of my insanity
Give me hope, give me love, give me strength
Make me free, every day of my life

If I love you with my heart, my soul, my mind
Then my life has found a new direction, it was never mine
'Cause when my heart is truly fixed on you
I find meaning in the things I do

Every day I'm giving you everything
Every thought, every word, every song I sing
It ain't no matter what life may bring, I lay it down

'Cause every day you make sense of me
In the midst of my insanity
Give me hope, give me love, give me strength
Make me free, every day of my life

Not simply just surviving
There's so much more I'm finding
Than living life so blinded and confused

'Cause where I find my freedom
Is serving at God's feet and I'm listening, searching
Just waiting, working, every, every day

Every day I'm giving you everything
Every thought, every word that I sing
It ain't no matter what life may bring, I lay it down

Every day I make sense of me
In the midst of my insanity
Give me hope, give me love, give me strength
Make me free, every day of my life

Joy Williams,"We laughed out loud til we cried 
And the tears were sweet 
Midnight melted to morning

So, don't let go 
Hold onto every moment 
Always know 
Hold on to every moment that You can

We move on with no regrets to our destiny 
Held by the hands of the Father 
We share His love and He leads us through 
All these days 
Cause they slip away through our fingers 
So

So don't let go 
Hold onto every moment 
Always know 
Hold on to every moment that You can

Running through yesterday into tomorrow 
Don't let it just drift away 
Forget about tying the hands of time 
Give every minute to the One who's given today
 
So don't let go 
Hold onto every moment

Hold on to every moment that You can",Every Moment
Joy Williams,"Pondering mysteries with a girlfriend over tazoberry tea
And an open Bible, yeah, there we were
Asking all deep questions about life, and love, and God
And how it all came to be

And why this, and why that, and why me
And why not, and why, why do I think this way?
I wonder why?

I wonder, wonder, wonder why?
I wonder, wonder why?
All of these questions echo in my mind
I wonder, wonder why?

Throughout the rest of our conversation
I kept coming back to one thing, I don't understand
Why would God leave all of heavens glory
Just to come and live and die as a man?
And why grace, and why mercy, why'd give it all for me
And why, and why does he love this way?
I wonder why?

I wonder, wonder, wonder why?
I wonder, wonder why?
All of these questions echo in my mind
I wonder, wonder why?

Why does he love me like he loves me?
All of these questions echo in my mind
I wonder, wonder why?

Every little thing that my mind can question
Just leads me back to one thing, Gods love for me
Every little thing that my mind can question
Just leads me back to one thing, Gods love for me

I wonder, wonder, wonder why?
I wonder, wonder why?
So many questions

Yeah, I wonder why your love is so amazing
I just can't believe it, ooo
It's so rich and wide, I wonder why?

Every little thing that my mind can question
Just leads me back to one thing, Gods love for me
Every little thing that my mind can question
Just leads me back to one thing, Gods love for me

Learning the ways of a carpenter's son 
Just a little boy gazing at the stars

Or would I have known

To walk along beside you never look away 
Just your whisper and the wind and sea obey 
To see you feed the people 
To feel the healing in your touch 
I wish I could have been there

To hear you pray in the garden alone 
Laying you will with each tear
To see you walk that lonely road 
Willing to die for me 

And in that 
Moment I know I should have been there
You took my cross and gave your life

Joyce Breach,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap
Joyce Breach,"Zing, Zing, Zing a little Zong with me
I know we're not beside the Zuider Zee
But when you're zittin' by the zide of me,
I want to zing a little zong.

Zing zome zentimental melody
About a chapel or an apple tree
About a couple living happily
And I'll be glad to zing along

This ain't the zeason for getting' kinda zilly
You really are a dolly, a dolly and a dilly
You got a reason to cuddle kinda close to me
And we can do a very clever piece of close harmony

We've got a most important date to zet
I'm sure that we will make a great duet
And we can zing a little love zong all night long.",Zing a Little Zong
Joyce Breach,"Oh, give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me
Just a little something, meaning love cannot die
No matter where you chance to be

So I'll pray for you, night and day for you
It will see me through like a charm 'til you return
So give me something I can remember you by
When you are far away from me

So I'll pray for you, every single day for you
It will see me through like a charm until you return

Joyce Carr,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Joyce Carr,"There goes the girl I dreamed all through school about, 
There goes the girl I'll now be a fool about 
Ring down the curtain, I'm certain at present

Don't even know if she has been spoken for. 
If she is tied, the ties must be broken, for 
Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me

Stars in the blue, tho' you're at a distance 
You can at least do this,

Joyce Carr,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Joyce Carr,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Joyce Collins,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Joyce Lyons,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round About Midnight
Joyce Lyons,"Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love
Get out of town
Be good to me, please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear
I care for you much too much
And when you're near, close to me, dear
We touch too much

The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That, darling, it's getting me down
So, on your mark, get set
Get out of town",Get out of Town (Porter)

Diamond clips and emerald rings

Joyce Lyons,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Joyce Manor,"I heard you on the wireless back in ‘52
Lying awake intent on tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through

They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machines and new technology
and now I understand the problems you can see

I met your children
What did you tell them?

Video killed the radio star

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
Do you remember the jingles used to go

You were the first one
You were the last one

In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far
Pictures came and broke your heart, put the blame on VCR",Video Killed the Radio Star
Joyce Moreno,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Joyce Moreno,"Quem quiser morar em mim
Tem que morar no que o meu samba diz
Tem que nada ter de seu
Mas tem que ser o rei do seu país
Tem que ser uma vidinha folgada
Mas senhor do seu nariz
Tem que ser um ""não faz nada""
Mas saber fazer alguém feliz

Tem que viver devagarinho
Pra poder ver a vida passar
Tem que ter um pouco de carinho para dar
Precisa, enfim
Saber gastar e ao receber uma esmolinha
Dar de troco o céu e o mar
Tem que ser um louco
Mas um louco para amar

Vai ter que ter tudo isso
Tudo isso pra contar

Vai ter que ter tudo isso
Tudo isso pra contar

Tem que bater muita calçada
Só cantando o que o povo pedir
E só vendo a moçada praticando pra faquir
Precisa, enfim, filosofar
Que ser alguém é não ser nada
E não ser nada é ser alguém
Tem que bater samba
E bater samba muito bem

Vai ter que ter tudo isso
Tudo isso e o céu também

Verde mar, espelho do céu
Minha vida é uma ilha bem distante
Flutuando no oceano da ventura de viver

Céu e mar, estrelas na areia

Meus desejos são estrelas pequeninas
Vão brilhando de alegria por alguém

É preciso só esperar pra acontecer
Felizmente a gente encontra alegria
No carinho e devoção

Joyce Moreno,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ô Bahia, iaiá
Bahia que não me sai do pensamento
Faço o meu lamento, oi
Na desesperança, oi
De encontrar nesse mundo
O amor que eu perdi na Bahia
Vou contar
Na Baixa do Sapateiro
Eu encontrei um dia
A morena mais frajola da Bahia
Pedi um beijo, não deu
Um abraço, sorriu
Pedi a mão, não quis dar
Fugiu

E a vontade que não tenha fim, este sol
É viver, ver chegar ao fim,

E olhar pra esse olhar perdido
Nesse mar azul
Uma onda nasceu, calma desceu sorrindo,

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol

E o barquinho ao coração deslizando na canção

I hear their mouths making foreign sounds
Sometimes I think they're all just speaking tongues

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you

Deeper than the deep blue see is

Used to wait up for you til like five in the morning

Finding numbers in the glove of the range
But I didn't complain 
I loved you the same
But I got a surprise for you today

To the finer thangs
The passion that we shared was 
Straight off the chain

Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.

JT Hodges,"I came up river on the gravel barge from new Orleans
She was standing on the cobblestones
In a pair of cut off jeans
I asked what she was doing
She said ""sugar I'm killin' time""
Then I handed her my wallet and said ""baby so am I""

She said ""you might need these""
And then handed me her shades.
Took me to a ballroom darker than the ace of spades
I asked ""what's this we're drinking?""
She said ""call it smokey blues""
Couldn't tell you what it tasted like but I know I had a few.

And we danced
And we laughed
Never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now.
With her hands in my hair
Like a million magic fingers
She said ""look me up when you get back to town""
""Look you up?""I said
""Hell I'm gonna hunt you down""

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na hunt you down

She asked where I was coming from
I said ""I'm just coming round. How bout you?""
And she drove me to the highest hill in German town.
Daddy's money bought the mansion.
They flew in the plain for free.
She said ""I can drop you off anywhere or you can stay with me""

And we danced
And we laughed
Never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now.
With her hands in my hair
Like a million magic fingers
She said ""look me up when you get back to town""
""Look you up?"" I said
""Hell I'm gonna hunt you down""

Last night I saw a falling star dive straight into the river
And I thought about that girl in German town
I gotta hunt her down

And we danced
And we laughed
Never talked about tomorrow
We just lived a little in the here and now.
With her hands in my hair
Like a million magic fingers
She said ""look me up when you get back to town""
""Look you up?"" I said

About the time I tried to get tha paper, ya feel me
1989 in the cut, on the grind
Cause I'm fresh outta school wit my nickel-plated 9
I hit a cut or two, from the T the A the S the K, ya see
Me up they beat up, players on the street up
Creepin' in jack mode, smooth we hit the back row
4-deep in a astro van ready to tax those
Unexpected players on the boulevard
14 years old, rocks in a stolen car
And I thought I had it going on
But my momma always told me it wouldn't last to long
A hard head make a soft ass
Wit a pocket full of rocks and a sock full of dirty cash
It's like I trip down a one-way street
Wit nowhere to turn and hard knocks to meet
A young G about the situation
Take the good wit the bad as I turn another page and
Set it up going pound for pound
Cause I knew one day, man, that the game was going down

Chorus:
You know it's going down, man
Cause I knew one day that the players will get paid
One my way to the T.O.P.
Wit the rest of the players from the GLP
It's going down

Can't cope wit the streetlife

Two years done passed and two homies done lost they life
And now I grew a few inches taller
No more dreams of being a big time baller
No more cracks sacks, coke and knife straps
Thinking about the Get Low, man and the G stacks
Kicking facts when I'm in your town
Cause I'm lettin' it be known man, that the game is going down

Chorus

Representing to the fullest I can pull this shit completely
You can't meet me toe-to-toe, at these hits I got the gift, G
...
Foul from the start, so I'm sick wit my stidnyle
Take it from me, I'm just a G about my paper
Turnin' show out, I rose out I got much clout
So bust a shot when I flow, coming through the door
I let ya know I'm just a player representing Get Low
I thought you knew me, you cannot do me, you ain't no player, punk
Trippin' up off that shit, man, that bombed out Cali stomp
Funk wit the cleverness I can settle this
It be a destiny it has to be smooth like a masterpiece
Ya hit tha track quickly to get ya money on
So I hit the Labb, to make this shit gone
Settin' it up, player, when I'm in your town
Cause I'm lettin' it be known, man, that the game is going down",It's Going Down
JT the Bigga Figga,"It's a hot summer day in the year of 84'
Fresh out of summer school headed for the store
Watchin the O.G.'s standing out gettin rich
Slangin the fat brown bags of the good shit
Dope is out but I really ain't seen it though
Dope fiends smokin the shit by the corner store
Broke as fuck kinda bummy with nappy hair
But what can I say when a playa's on welfare
Life is hard and I'm only 13
Always on a prowl, always on a scheme
There wasn't nothin to do but have fun
Wait for the dark then creep to Emporium
Get the T.I., get the Guess shirts
Get the fresh couch break for the turf
Doin it boley never in fear
Gettin they punk ass for about a year
Until I got called, went to the hall
Writin on the wall, waitin for a hair call
Released to moms, what can I say
Off to Sears, the very next day
Now Sears is easier 'cause it's in the area
Walk to the back of the rack then carried the
Shit back to the stolen car
Drive and park by the house is not too far
My gear was fat but still no money though
Talked to my homey then got fronted so
Stackin my shit, hustlin cash
Gotta get out, gave him his half
Hooked up with a friend oh we started boomin
Then we go to some O's then I went solo
Stackin my pay gettin it on
Got myself a beeper and a cellular phone
A donkey roll, a twenty-two
Jumped on my bike, headed for school
Locked up my shit, 'cause the fools be gankin
A young nigga pimpin that Benjamin Franklin
So I walked the halls, wishin the Merrier
Hooked up with a freak by the cafeteria
Hair was long, pretty with butt
I told the freak I was about to cut
So call me at eight and don't be late
When I left the school there was a big mistake
So I jumped on my bike and headed for the set
With a pocketful of rocks ah man I regret
For not stayin in school, for just doin my work
Gettin chased by the Task now I feel like a jerk
So I'm on the run and I better run fast
'cause if I don't they're gonna beat my ass
Hit a quick cut, run by the Ave.
Go to the Valley you know I gotta laugh
Jogged to the third floor runnin the dope spot
A playa too quick a young brotha can't get caught
Bitch want credit better go to the bank
Then my homey walked in with the straight-laced dank
Two young playas gettin high on the couch
In a spot, at a dope fiend's house
Two hours passed now it must be cool
'cause I gotta make money fuck going back to school
Wrapped up for the crime now I gotta do time
But when I'm out I'll be back on the grind
All my homies kept flippin and the man kept trippin
But me JT, I'm a victim of the system 
Shit got thick but what can I say
In the life of a player but that is the hard way

(second verse)
Now it's 92', as you can see
So I gotta get paid from the are-A-P
I was in the dope game now I'm in the rap game
But I gotta get paid so fuck the fame
I'm a tell ta, it goes somethin like this
By any means necessary I'm gettin my grits
Here's a little somethin by the man
He's always schemin up a plan
Always tryin to say which way is right
Always tryin to force us to the way of life
Of robbin, killin, straight dope dealin
Young niggas runnin around tryin to be villians
So they offer us minimum wage
Knowin damn well we're gonna get the 12 gauge
To go outside and pull a jack or a caper
Hopin that we make front page of the paper
Extra extra, black brotha dead
Shot in the head by a cop named Fred
When you read the paper, you know it's a damn lie
Talk about justifiable homicide
Then they say we no good at all
And if we are, for just raps and basketball
Niggas ain't shit, niggas all lazy
All they do is fuck go to jail and have babies
Shit, I'm not that nigga
I'm JT the one and only Bigga Figga
That's one of the reasons why I'm doin my own thang
Now I know you've heard the song, so mind your own mane
And you'll be fine and you be cool
And all you young brothas, you better stay in school
Quit runnin around tryin to be the neighborhood jacker
Better go to recess and eat some cheese and crackers
Before you find yourself layin up on a tombstone
Gonna be there forever, 'cause that is your home
No more TV and no more Nintendo
No more bikes and no more friends bro
You better wake up before it's too late
Before you find yourself standin out in heaven's gate
'cause you tryin to get in but no my friend
'cause ya die, or committed a sin
Tryin to peel a cap but ya got your cap peeled
Now your mother's outside wonderin why you got killed
Use better judgment in the game you play
In the life of a black man but that is the hard way",The Hard Way

JT the Bigga Figga,"When you make the Kool-Aid
You put your own amount of sugar in it
Sweet, sweet love to your taste
To your own specifications
Now tell Kool-Aid, how much you want
How much can you flaunt (Tell em' bitch)
One scoop or two (Yeah)
Sweet, sweet love
When your rolling down the street (Errr!)
On them twenty inches and you ask her how much she want
(How much you want bitch) And you got a beat that goes with it

Sweet, sweet love
And she says I want it all
And you know it's cool-Aid in her tank
And your fixing to ride the stripes away
To sweet, sweet love
Take that thong off (Take it off)
And let me touch your thighs (Touch the pussy)
While we roll, I promise to keep my eyes on the road
While I'm touching that sweet, sweet love
To your specifications, to your gratifications
Yeah Kool-Aid is like an aphrodisiac
Your pleasure is mine
Like when a whore goes out to whore
And bring you back all the money
That's sweet, sweet love
Don't try it and even put some strychnine 
Listen to the pronunciation of strychnine in this cool-Aid
This ain't no Jim Jones thing
This is just sweet, sweet, love

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I met her back in the day
Knew how much the bitch weighed and payed
It was sort of like a masquerade
Fake suede boots and Cadillac coupes swoop the boulevard (Err!)
In hot pursuit and we ain't afraid to shoot
From hotel to motel, for the highest clientele
You and you, I give a fuck how the pussy smell
Heads to tails, the bitch bail with limp
With a hell of a limp, see on that gangsta tip
See-notes, fifties and tens we cashed in
Bought a brand new Benz on gold Lorenzos rims
Anything I want my bitch gon' go out and get it
Hustle round and swear that a real pimp is his business
Who got the floss and ball to rise and fall
If a bitch want to do it she gon' fuck em' all
Dog, dog what up, Kool-Aid pimpin' keep on dippin'
Sippin' yac with a yamp, puttin' hoes on they back
It's like that

Everyone want to know how a pimp can do his thing
 
Ridin' sly, gettin' high
Bitches on the corner sellin' pussy tonight hey!
Everyone want to know how a pimp can do his thing
Ridin' sly, gettin' high
Got plenty of my bitches sellin' pussy tonight hey!

Tapped in with this baller I met, pushin' the Vette
He moved to California said he ain't got searched yet
Ah, she gon' blow ya socks off
And peal them rocks off
Bring em' home to daddy, so saddy
Pimp in the Caddy
Keep my hand on the gun
Cause they got me on the run
Menage trois in the telly
Anaconda all in the belly
She gon' serve four tricks
And suck some more dick
Homie this a bad bitch
Better than average
King Bing, Don Bishop, and White tie Gotti
Feel more slim than the Max to skip and dump the body
P-i-m-p, young G's, O.G.s

Fleetwood bronze, mobile phones and O-Zs nigga
Daz Dillinger feelin' ya every time you bust
Playa discussion, 'Kuruption' just like Kurupt
Fifty toes on the corner, block hatin' is irrelevant
They sellin' it, motherfucker are inhalin' this
Here pimpin'


Me and my homies we pimp the same ho
Pimp the same ho, ridin' through slow
Blaze through third and first and do what ya do
I done, done I done, done
Pull up and wrap the shotgun
They know me Gotti, she know we pimpin' and never slippin'
I pimp hoes on the side, side
Side, ride, slide provide applied
Upped the supplied supply
Swats, I gave it my own try
Improvise, be saddled up pimpin' hoes worldwide
Smack the bitch, smack the bitch
Take the bitch money, money
That's my grip the bitch get
Shakin' that lil' limp skinny ass body the bitch got
Turnin' the Gotti on the cock
And make the bitch hit the block, I'm tired of these hoes
Now a days fallin' crawlin' ah bitch come on
Bitches reconcile, ball and gobble and gargle
And swallow and her name was Tina
Where's the bitch
Known through the hood by the way she blow dicks

You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell y'all what papi told me

Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up

Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Uncured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's con-ed style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part, nigga.

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.

Quizás no me hagas caso

Qué hacer con esa realidad

Ya no soporto la rutina
Si somos uno para el otro
Porque siempre es igual

El mismo cine

Algunas copas o a cenar
Nos falta fantasía
Volver a conquistarnos
Recuperar aquel amor de locos
Porque el tiempo pasa
Y en nosotros todo sigue igual

Si te ruego me escuches
Respondes luego hablamos
Tal vez mañana será mejor
Y son mis canciones
Encuentro algún alivio

A este silencio eterno de mi voz
Como conseguir que me entiendas
No encuentro la forma
De mostrarte mi alma y mi necesidad
De sentirme enamorado

Si somos uno para el otro
Porque siempre es igual

Algunas copas o a cenar

The only one my arms will ever hold

All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind

It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

Le hizo perder la cabeza
Se fue al baño y se fumó
Y empezó a sonar la orquesta

Un, dos tres va y bien
Tocaba y se olvidaba de todo
Un, dos tres va y bien
La Fender le chorreaba de odio

El quería conocer
Eso de irse a California
Trabajaba en un taller
De mecánica en la Boca

El se apresuró
Y se arrancó de a uno los dientes
Y se salvó
Por ser de clase cincuenta y siete

Nunca tuvo un buen hogar
No fue padre ni buen hijo
Nunca conoció a Gardel
Sólo a Hendrix y a Tanguito

Se empezó a cansar
Y así probó algunas pastillas
Se volvió a cansar
Y no paró hasta ver la heroína

Está un loco en una calesita
Casi desnudo y con la vista enferma
Y daba vueltas y se sonreía
Y silbaba bajo por no molestar

Y Dios es una máquina de humo
Cambió la Fender por una Suzuki
Se fue a Brasil con plata de su abuela
Y estuvo preso por robar un auto

Y llegó a Gerais
Y se pegó el tren
Y Dios es una máquina de humo
Y Dios es una máquina de humo

Nadie más lo volvió a ver
Se sospecha que anda suelto
Disfrazado de faisán
O gendarme en algún puerto

Un, dos tres va y bien
Está un loco en una calesita

Dicen que un ángel lo atrapó en el baño
Lo crucificó y le sacó los ojos
Y con su sangre se pinto los labios
Y cortó sus piernas y se las comió
Y Dios es una máquina de humo

Se hunde una sandalia lágrimas

Fantasmales pasos
Huyen en pedazos
Sombras y juncales
Y un montón de madres lágrimas

Ay, ¿cuándo volverá
La flor a la rama y el olor al pan?
Lágrimas, lágrimas, lágrimas

",Postal de Guerra
Juan Carlos Baglietto,"Y te aplaudirán, te aplastarán
Aquí la frustración, la piel, las ganas
Aquí serás payaso y domador
Aquí serás el juez y el perdedor

Aquí se invertirán los roles
Para usted
Usted que está allí
Nosotros arriba

La calle, el escenario
Digamos mejor
Que es necesario
Actuar para vivir

Y en un fatal primer
Acto nacemos
Cambiando siempre
El vestuario y el juego

Siempre tras la emoción
Que es el sueldo esencial
Siempre tras la noche
Y las mesas de café

Jaqueamos la inteligencia
Como peón al rey
Jaqueamos la inteligencia
La hacemos canción

Toda esa magia escondida
La de los altos telones
No es nada más
Que un anhelo de dos
La gente, el actor
Las ganas de verse ahí

Se escuchó el último aplauso
Se fueron todas las luces
Quedaron solo fantasmas de ayer
Sin nombre, sin tez
Mañana quizás este el mío

",Actuar Para Vivir
Juan Carlos Baglietto,"Te seguiré hasta el final 
te buscaré en todas partes 
bajo la luz de la sombra 
en los dibujos del aire.
Te seguiré hasta el final 
te pediré de rodillas 
que te desnudes amor 
te mostraré mis heridas.

Y con las luces del alba 
antes que todos despierten 
se hará ceniza el deseo 
me marcharé para siempre.

Te seguiré hasta el final 
entre los musgos del bosque 
te pediré tantas veces 
que hagamos nuestra la noche 
Te seguiré hasta el final 
con el tesón del acero 
te buscaré por la lluvia 
para mojarme en tu beso.

Y con las luces del alba 
antes que todos despierten 
se hará ceniza el deseo 
me marcharé para siempre",Deseo
Juan Carlos Baglietto,"
Es difícil ver la realidad 
cuando las penas nos hacen mal 
confundimos el dolor con la poesía 
y la calle nos lastima al caminar. 
Buscás pedacitos de aquel cielo 
y no encontrás más que tu ventana 
ya la luna se dibuja un sol de enero 
ya no hay tiempo que dé para llorar. 
Adonde vas, canta el corazón, 
los días que vendrán, que quedan por vivir, 
y si el dolor te tira para atrás, 
te podés levantar, podés vivir. 
Una madrugada en el balcón
te acompaña sin pedir perdón, 
las ventanas van llamando a la mañana 
y se ríen en el rojo de este sol. 
Un poco de luces y un papel 
me ayudan a ver decir la piel. 
Yo te canto para siempre, 
para que cantemos juntos esta vez.",Los Dias Por Vivir
Juan Carlos Baglietto,"Hoy dice el periodico 
que ha muerto una mujer que conocí
que ha perdido en su campo el Atletic 
y que ha amanecido nevando en París 
que han pillado un alijo de coca 
que a pisis y acuario 
les toca el vinagre y la miel 
que apoyo el parlamento europeo 
una ley a favor de abolir el deseo 
que fallo la vacuna anti sida 
que un golpe de estado ha fallado en la luna, 
y movidas asi 
Pero nada decia el diario de hoy 
de esa sucia pasion, de este lunes marrón 
del obseno sabor a cubata de ron de tu piel 
del olor a colonia barata del amanecer 
de este cuarto sin medias ni besos 
de este frio de agosto en los huesos 
como un bisturí.

Hoy amor como siempre 
en el diario no hablaban de ti, ni de mi 
hoy amor igual que ayer como siempre 
en el diario no hablaban de ti 
en el diario no hablaban de ti 
en el diario no hablaban de ti, ni de mi 

Hoy dijo la radio 
que han hallado muerto al niño que yo fuí 
que han pagado un pasote de pelas 
por una acuarela falsa de Dalí 
que han caido la bolsa en el cielo 
que siguen las putas en huelga de celo en Moscú 
que subio la marea que fusilan mañana a Jesus de Judea 
que crecio el ahujero de ozono 
que el padre de hoy es el padre del mono 
del año 2000

Hoy amor como siempre …",Eclipse de Mar
Juan Carlos Baglietto,"Mary, Peggy, Betty, Julie rubias de New York
Cabecitas adoradas que mienten amor
Dan envidia a las estrellas
Yo no se vivir sin ellas

Mary, Peggy, Betty, Julie de labios en flor
Es como el cristal la risa loca de Julie
Es como el cantar de un manantial
Turba mi soar el dulce hechizo de Peggy
Su mirada azul honda como el mar

Deliciosas criaturas perfumadas
Quiero el beso de sus boquitas pintadas
Frágiles muecas del olvido y el placer
Re su alegra como un cascabel

Rubio cocktail que emborracha, as es Mary
Tu melena que es de plata quiero para mi
Si el amor que me ofrecas

Solo dura un breve da
Tiene el fuego de una brasa tu pasen
Betty es como el cristal

y no de sentar cabeza,pibe de barrio buen tropero en la partida 
un miembro mas del circo desesperado 
un punto en un planeta, un bicho que camina 
oh, oh, oh.

Aun resuenan los acordes, de una guerra en si bemol 
sin ninguna melodia, una mamó le pone nombre a su machito 
y asi las flores crecen junto a los cardos 
y derrotan las tormentas, y se caen y levantan 
oh, oh, oh.

Todavia me emocionan ciertas voces 
todavia creo en mirar a los ojos 
todavia tengo en mente cambiar algo 
todavia y a dios gracias todavia
El sol quema la lengua de los lagartos 
la verdad es buen veneno pa' las tripas 
todavia hay mucha gente que esta viva 
todavia y Dios gracias todavia.

Como canción de carnaval, se metio por el bolsillo

Your eyes that promise sweet nights,
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so sublime

Those cool and limpid green eyes -
A pool wherein my love lies.

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

And eyes that promise sweet nights
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.

Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes

Endulzara sus cuerdas

Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

Deja de decir que ya no sientes nada, ya lo se

Ya no vuelvo a morirme de sed, por su amor que es igual a desierto 
Ya no quiero volver con usted, ya no quiero, ser más su juguete 
Se lo juro que todo acabó, que nada quedó, de aquel anda y vete 
Se lo juro que todo acabó, que nada quedó, de aquel algarete 

Ya no quiero volver con usted, con usted, desperdicio la vida 
Ya no vuelvo a morirme de sed, por su amor que es la cusa perdida 
Ya no quiero volver con usted, quítese eso de su pensamiento 
Se lo juro que todo acabó, que nada quedó, de aquel sentimiento 
Y se lo juro que todo acabó, que nada quedó, de nada aquí adentro 
Y se lo juro que todo acabó, que nada quedó, de aquella locura 
Y se lo juro que todo acabó, que nada quedó, de aquella aventura",Ya No Quiero Volver Con Usted
Juan Gabriel,"Yo se que usted, tiene algo que decirme
Y no encuentra como hacerlo
Tal vez porque siente miedo pues bien sabe como herirme 
Yo se que usted, no halla como despedirme
Yo resuelvo su problema 
Usted por mi no sienta pena que mi orgullo esta muy firme 
Yo me voy, yo me voy si usted ya no me quiere 
Y antes de que me lo diga, no, no, no, yo mejor me voy 
Quédese tranquila, que yo ya me voy
Yo me voy si usted ya no me quiere
Que disfrute los placeres, que le brindan los quereres
De su más reciente amor

Juan Gabriel,"Cada vez que paso por la calles de Juárez 
Me traen muchos recuerdos de cuando era niño 
Me parece ver a las gentes 
Las cuales recuerdo con mucho cariño 

Ha cambiado mucho mi barrio 
Poco a poco van habiendo mas casas 
Con agua, gas y luz 
No quiero que se respire la misma pobreza 
A la cual me da tristeza desde mi juventud 

Las señoras amigas de mi madre 
Cuando voy a olvidarles, nunca 
Son todas un amor 
A cada una le digo a nombre de ella y mío 
Que las bendiga dios 

Con cariño y respeto yo recuerdo a todos mis maestros 
Pues de ellos parte soy 
Hoy suspiro por todos esos anos 
Recuerdos de momentos que hoy extraños 

Gracias por tanto amor 
Gracias por tanto amor 

A los 7 años tuve mi primer gran amigo 
Un lindo viejecito que se llamaba Juan 
Por él me puse ese nombre tan bonito 
Por que ese viejecito 
Me enseño a trabajar 
Juan, Juan, Juan 

Mujer fuerte, audaz, capaz bastante 
Activa y muy constante 
Tal como era mi escuela 
Directora amiga profesora 
Y toda una señora 
Su nombre Micaela 

A todas aquellas personas que me conocieron y que siempre 
Me dieron cariño y amor 
Quiero decirles que los recuerdo 
Que siempre los llevo conmigo por donde quiera que yo voy 

Y que nunca los voy a olvidar 
Ni a Micaela ni a mis maestros ni a las amigas de mi madre 
Ni a mi gran amigo 
Juan, Juan, Juan 

Eternamente agradecido

Juan Gabriel,"No entiendo de que vas 
hay veces que me comes de tanto quererme 
Otras veces nunca estás 
y por mucho que te busque no se donde te escondes 

No piensas igual todo te ha sentado mal 
yo es que no podía dejarte no pasar 
Hay cosas del amor que no pueden faltar 
no se porque me das una de cal y otra de arena 
si te he dicho ya que pa mi es una condena 
que me lleva hasta desesperar 
y no se como arreglar 
que no me conformo con tenerte a medias 
mas tengo una obsesión 
si pasamos horas juntos siento que te aburres 
luego pienso y digo no si estuviera mal 
seguro que eso no se confunde 
que quieres de mi si ya has dejado de sentir 

Dímelo bajito, me olvido ya de ti 
si todo sigue igual ven corriendo por mi 
No se porque me das una de cal y otra de arena 
si te he dicho ya que pa mi 
Es una condena que me lleva hasta desesperar 
y no se como arreglar 
Si cuanto mas pido memos das 
no quiero regresar a vivir de esa manera 
Ya no puedo llorar fuera miedos 
fuera penas que el amor esta pa disfrutar 

Y si es conmigo sabes 
ya que no me conformo con tenerte a medias mas",Meche
Juan Gabriel,"Desde aquella noche 
Cuando yo te vi 
Me di cuenta que eres alguien especial 
Me sentí contento y mucho muy feliz 
De haber ido esa noche al bar 

Tu bailabas y bailabas y yo 
Te veía y te veía 
Así bailar, tu mirada tan coqueta que me dio 
Que no te quitaba la vista al bailar. 

Yo brinde contigo a lo lejos...Salud contestaste 
Muy sonriente tu Salud y charlamos largamente 
Y tu no sabias quien era yo 
Mis amigos muy sorprendidos de mí 
Me veían muy contento y muy feliz 
Yo les dije muy seguro que al fin he encontrado 
Un buen amor

Todo lo q no te pude dar 

Hoy tu madre muy feliz ha de estar 
De tu buena suerte 
Vuelvo a sentir tanto amor 
No no no como antes 
Porque nadie me amo como tu 
Y es que no, no, no sabes 
De la entrega total como tu 
No, no no hay nadie 
Tres veces lo intente 
Y las tres fracase no, no, no 
No supe amarles 

No, no, no

Juan Gabriel,"Amor es amor, del mundo lo más grande que hay 
Amor es amor, no tiene final jamás 
Ya lo han dicho mil poetas en los versos más hermosos 
El amor es el que reina en cada ser, que tiene corazón

Amor es amor, del mundo lo más grande que hay, sí
Amor es amor, no tiene final jamás 
Mira la naturaleza, mira que bella es la vida 
Es amor el que respiras en todo el mundo hallarás amor

Con tan sólo un poco de amor yo me conformaría 
Con tan sólo un poco de ti te daría mi vida, 
No espero más ni te pido más con eso me basta 
Para vivir feliz, feliz

Dame un poco de amor sólo un poco de amor 
Dame un poco de amor un poquito de amor",Amor Es Amor
Juan Gabriel,"Te llamo, pero no respondes 
Te busco, pero tu te escondes 
Te espero, pero nunca vienes 
Te quiero, pero no me quieres

En vano no siento tanto amor 
Estoy dando de mas 
Tal vez no logre 
Que tu me quieras como yo 
Por que soy pobre 

Pero algun dia no sere 
Yo voy a ser mejor que tu 
No se ni cuanto he de esperar 
Pero muy rico un dia sere 

Quizas no tengas juventud 
Pero yo igual te he de querer 
Y entonces vas a saber tu y entonces tu vas a saber 
Que asi se quiere en veracruz",Asi Se Quiere
Juan Gabriel,"Si preguntaras que por qué te quiero tanto 
Ni yo mismo sé por que, ni yo mismo sé por que 
Mas yo te amo 
No creo hacerte daño con quererte 
No importa que no llegues a quererme

Estoy acostumbrado a tus desprecios 
Que el día que me acaricies lloraré 
Te quiero tanto, tanto 
Que aunque quiera 
Dejarte de olvidarte no podré

Si tú quisieras dejarme 
Lo hubieras hecho de una vez ya 
Pero es que hasta tu comprendes 
Que es muy difícil otro encontrar amor 
Que acambio de tus desprecios te dé su amor 
Y mil cosas mas

Te digo que tus desprecios 
Me he acostumbrado y es la verdad 
Y que tan sólo con verte y estar a tu lado 
Yo vivo muy feliz amor 
Que sufro cuando te miro que estás muy triste 
Y creo que es por mí",El Dia Que Me Acaricies Llorare
Juan Gabriel,"Un día más y otro más sin tu cariño 
Qué hacer, dónde estar, siempre es lo mismo 
Quisiera encontrar, otra como tú
Que sea mejor que tú, que se parezca a ti 
Tu cara nada más 

Oh, irme lejos de aqui, donde no vayas tú
Pero en mi mente estás, no te puedo olvidar 
Que horrible soledad 

Como he de ser feliz 
Si la felicidad la tienes toda tú 
Y no me quieres más, qué culpa tengo yo 
Que me encuentre de ti enamorado, enamorado 

Si doquiera estas tú 
Un lugar ya no existe, que no me hable de ti 
Y al final es soledad 

De que manera di, tú quieres que te olvide 
Si sabes tú muy bien, que yo no sé olvidar 
De que manera di, tú quieres que te olvide 
Si en todo Monterrey tus recuerdos están",Doquiera Estás Tú

En cualquier instante, vendrán a tocarme 
Las puertas de mi corazón 

Y olvidaré, el dolor con que sufrí, y que lloré 
Y que viví, y el ayer, en la soledad",Sera Mañana
Juan Gabriel,"Te voy a enseñar, que el amor, no es para jugar, es para querer 
No juegues conmigo, yo te quiero mucho, no te lo imaginas 
En fin, en fin, solo dame un poco de tiempo 
Y en cualquier momento lo demostrare 
Uno, dos y tres, y me das solo un beso
Te vas corriendo y yo no se porque, 
Uno, dos y tres, y me das otro beso
Me da pena este amor en juego 
Yo no se si tú, me amas en serio, más te advierto que yo no juego 
Porque en el amor, nunca hay que jugar
Solo aprender, a saber amar
Porque es tan divino, tan humano y bello
Que se da con el alma, y pasión, y pasión 
También, es tormento, muchos sufrimientos, pero es amor

De aquel amor que fue
Tuyo

Guardaré en mi corazón
Las caricias y los besos
Que nos dimos

Y trata de olvidar

Aunque tanto nos quisimos
Nos tenemos que olvidar

Mira bésame, desespero más

Sabes que estoy enamorado de ti 
Pero me siento un poquito mal 
Será porque no me quieres besar 
Ay bésame, ay bésame 
Nada, nada, nada pasara 
Estoy enamorado como un loco de ti

Quiero dedicar esta canción con mucho amor y respeto
Más que una canción es una oración de amor que quiero dedicar
Como siempre, con el mismo amor, cariño y respeto
A todas las mamás que esta noche me han venido a visitar
Sobre todo para aquellas que estén un poquito más lejos de mí

Tú eres la tristeza de mis ojos
Que lloran en silencio por tu amor
Me miro en el espejo y veo en mi rostro
El tiempo que he sufrido por tu adiós
Obligo a que te olvide el pensamiento
Pues, siempre estoy pensando en el ayer
Prefiero estar dormida que despierto
De tanto que me duele que no estés

Como quisiera, ay
Que tú vivieras
Que tus ojitos jamás se hubieran
Cerrado nunca y estar mirándolos
Amor eterno
E inolvidable
Tarde o temprano yo voy a estar contigo
Para seguir, amándonos

Yo he sufrido mucho por tu ausencia
Desde ese día hasta hoy, no soy feliz
Y aunque tengo tranquila mi conciencia
Yo sé que pude haber yo hecho más por ti
Oscura soledad estoy viviendo yo
La misma soledad de tu sepulcro, mamá
Y es que tú eres, es que tú eres el amor de cual yo tengo
El más triste recuerdo de Acapulco

Pero como quisiera, ay
Que tú vivieras
Que tus ojitos jamás se hubieran
Cerrado nunca y estar mirándolos
Amor eterno
E inolvidable
Tarde o temprano estaré contigo
Para seguir, amándonos

Amor eterno
Eterno
Amor eterno
Eterno

Ojos que hayan derramado tantas lágrimas por penas
De dolor
De amor de tantas despedidas y despenas
Soledad, eso es todo lo que tengo ahora y tus recuerdos
Que hacen más triste la angustia de vivir pensando como siempre en ti
Ojos que te vieron tanto y que no han vuelto a verte hasta el sol de hoy
Tristes de tanto extrañarte
Y de tanto esperarte desde aquel adiós
Soledad, eso es todo lo que tengo ahora, y eso es todo lo que tengo ahora y tus recuerdos
Que hacen más triste la angustia de vivir pensando como siempre, para siempre y por siempre en ti

Que hablen siempre con la verdad 

Yo amo y estoy, estoy, estoy, estoy 
Muy enamorado y soy muy feliz 
Y cuando estoy triste busco la manera 
De sonreír 

Por eso canta, canta, canta 
Que yo te invito a cantar conmigo 
En esta vida siempre tenemos 
Por quien vivir 

Por eso canta, canta, canta, canta, canta 
Que yo te invito a cantar conmigo 
Ya no estés triste busca un amor 
Para que seas feliz, canta",Canta Canta
Juan Gabriel,"Yo estaba solo, vivía muy triste
Creía que nunca iba a encontrar un amor
Hasta que llegaste, se fueron mis penas
Y con tu cariño empecé a olvidar el dolor

Yo estaba solo, tan solo soñaba
Creía que todos mis sueños estaban tan lejos de ti
Hasta que llegaste, ha, se fueron mis penas
Y con tu cariño empecé a olvidar
Y a olvidar, y a olvidar mi dolor

Con tu amor
Se fueron mis penas
Y llegó la felicidad
Gracias a ti, no ciento tristezas, ni dolor
Hoy soy muy feliz

Yo estaba solo, tan solo soñaba
Creía que todos mis sueños estaban tan lejos de ti
Hasta que llegaste, ha, se fueron mis penas
Y con tu cariño empecé a olvidar
Y a olvidar, y a olvidar mi dolor

Con tu amor
Se fueron mis penas
Y llegó la felicidad
Gracias a ti, no ciento tristezas, ni dolor
Hoy soy muy feliz

Pero con tu amor
Se fueron mis penas
Y llegó la felicidad
Gracias a ti, no siento tristeza, ni dolor
Hoy soy muy feliz
Hoy soy muy feliz
Hoy soy muy feliz
Con tu amor

Si tú conmigo eres muy mal
Si nunca me has dado un poco

De tu cariño no entiendo nada
Porque estar enamorados si cada vez
Que te hablo callas

Ya no me trates mal, ya no seas así
Porque puede ser que al no verme más
Vayas a sufrir y a llorar

Ya no me trates mal, ya no seas así
Porque ya no habrá otro como yo
Que te quiera igual, que te de su amor

Tal vez por lo que te quiero
No te doy tiempo a que tú me quieras
Ya vez que te lo demuestro

También tú debes de ser sincera
Mi vida no desperdicies
Este cariño y mi vida entera

Ya no me trates mal, ya no seas así
Porque puede ser que al no verme mas
Vayas a sufrir y a llorar

Ya no me trates mal, ya no seas así
Porque ya no habrá otro como yo
Que te quiera igual, que te de su amor

No me trates mal, ya no seas así
Ya no seas así, no me trates mal
No me trates mal, ya no seas así
Ya no seas así, no me trates mal

No me trates mal, ya no seas así
Ya no seas así, no me trates mal

Con tus mañanas de sol

Y hace que brote el amor
Por todo el sembradío
Y en las cosechas sin flor
Yo miro el mundo distinto

Por eso te extraño tanto

Arrieros es el caminante
Sus pasos son campesinos
Que marchan siempre adelante
Abriendo nuevos caminos

Y van sembrando el mañana
Y el porvenir de sus hijos
Para que tengan mañana
Un mundo nuevo y distinto

No tengo ningún temor
Estoy acostumbrado a estar
Completamente solo
Y sin ningún amor

Yo no se lo qué es amor
Nunca me importo saber
Nunca he estado enamorado
Y si una vez yo quise
No recuerdo a quién

Déjame, cuando quieras déjame
Déjame, que me importa si te vas
Déjame, cuando quieras déjame
Déjame, cuando quieras hazlo ya

Yó no sé lo que es dolor
Ni tristeza ni sufrir
Sé lo que es estar completemente
Libre y siempre he sido muy felíz

Todo es mío bajo el sol
Que me importa si te vas
Yo no me acostumbro a nada
Ni a nadie en el mundo
Yo no sé extrañar

Déjame, cuando quieras déjame

Siempre he estado solo
Me encanta la soledad
Canto, río y lloro
De felicidad pero nada mas

Que ella dejo de quererte
Y pensar que algún día juro amarte

Hasta la muerte
Pero ahora se arrepiente
De haber perdido el tiempo

Que sufrió para olvidar tus besos
Que se tuvo que ir y muy lejos

Y ahora si la vez
Ni le preguntes
Que si te quiere
Ya no te quiere

Te quiso mucho
Cuanto te quiso
Y hoy al que ama
Contigo tiene un parecido

Pero distintos en sentimientos
Porque él es bueno
Y tú sigues siendo el mismo

Te quiso como a nadie
Y jamás lo ha negado

Pero ahora es muy distinto
Otra vez se ha enamorado
El ya sabe que te quiso
Y también que te ha olvidado

Que sufrió para olvidar tus besos
Que se tuvo que ir y muy lejos

Le enseño también a perdonarte
Y a quererlo, como lo quiere

Te quiso mucho cuanto te quiso
Que hoy al que ama
Contigo tiene un parecido

Pero distintos en sentimientos

Y tú sigues, siendo el mismo

De alguien para despertar 

Ahora

Porque es que más no puedo, no es bueno
No debo ni quiero ya más soledad 
Yo espero yo busco yo quiero amor encontrar 
Si en el mundo hay tanta gente 
Diferente una de esas tantas gentes me amaran 

Alguien alguien palla 
Pero esta soledad 
De verlo crecer 
Esta horrible soledad 
Y se deben de

Debo hacerlo todo con amor 
Hoy esta noche yo saldré algún bar 
Si no me escapo de ya va a acabar 
Con esta fuerza de voluntad 
Parando al corazón 

Ay debo hacerlo 
Es que debo hacerlo todo con amor 
Quizás esta noche sea mi noche y ya 
Quiero sentirme vivo una vez más 

Este caso en realidad es de vida o muerte 
Necesito un buen amor urgentemente 
Ay quítenme esta soledad 

Debo, puedo y quiero 
Tengo el derecho de vivir 
Quiero puedo y debo 
Con alguien todo compartir 
Aha, valla valla 

Necesito un buen amor 
Porque ya no aguanto más 
Veo la vida con dolor 
Ay quitante esta, ay quítenme 
Esta soledad 

Necesito que alguien me haga compañía 
Ya no quiero noches que son de agonía 
Yo no tengo nada nadie todavía 
Y yo necesito que alguien me reviva",Eres un Amor

Tu dulce mirada 
Y aquellas palabras 
Que hablan de amor 

Por eso te quise

Me habla de ti

La noche sin luna

A alumbrar su día

Juan Gabriel,"Mírame a los ojos
Pero frente a frente
Y dime francamente
Si ya quieres terminar

He sentido tus brazos
Cansado de abrazarme
Y antes de besarme
Algo quieres hablar

Y he visto a tus ojos
Llorar de sentimiento
Y ya estoy comprendiendo
Tu extraño mirar

Pero tú que no te atreves
O tienes miedo de hablar no lo sé
Tal vez es que no quieres
A mi vida lastimar, eso puede ser

Pero yo mi amor
Me lleno de pavor
Tan sólo de pensar
Que quieres terminar

Pero no, no necesito que des una razón
Fíjate que no, no
Tan sólo vete y no me digas donde estas
Por favor

Porque, ay amor
Si te vuelvo a encontrar
Yo te vuelvo a querer
Y tal vez, mucho más

Porque ¡ay! Amor
Si te vuelvo a encontrar
Yo te vuelvo a querer
Y tal vez, mucho más

Pero no, no necesito que des una razón

Al cielo lo miras de otro color 
Todo es diferente, vives más la vida

Por eso es que el alma sufre una gran herida

Me fui para estar mejor
Iba en busca de trabajo
Pero ¡oh! desilusión

Cuando llegue a san francisco
Nadie me tendió la mano
Esos norteamericanos
Carecen de amor

Luego me fui pa’ los ángeles
Hay nunca sale el sol
Es bonito no lo niego
Pero hay muchísimo smog

Y por si fuera poquito
Tienes otro gran problema
Tienes que andarte cuidándote
Siempre de la migración

Luego me fui pa’ arizona
Donde hace un cruel calor
Ahí cualquiera se muere
De una deshidratación

Luego me fui para Texas
Que es un poquito mejor
Pero en cualquier parte encuentras
Mucha discriminación

Total que no halle trabajo
Y sin papeles peor
Si los que son residentes
No consiguen menos yo

Mejor me vine pa’ mi tierra
A mi pueblito tzintzuntzan
He comprendido que en todito
Mas bonito es michoacán

Ahora trabajo en el campo
Trabajo de sol a sol
Ahora estoy con mi familia
Y cada vez mucho mejor

Adiós gringos peleoneros
Buenos pa’ las guerras son
Ellos creen que dios es blanco
Y es mas moreno que yo l

Mi casita de adobe, esa es mi estancia 
Oigo el canto del gallo anunciando 
Que hay viene a mi rancho 
Un bello y nuevo día 
El amor se despierta
La fe se levanta, la vida comienza 
Y todo en armonía 

Cuando estoy en el campo, me voy al río 
A escuchar el silencio de Dios y el mío 
Y me baña, me arrulla, me duerme, me lleva 
Y me calma igual que cuando niño 
Lo hiciera mi padre adorado
Mi madre divina con su amor y cariño 

Cuando estoy en el campo y cae la tarde 
Antes que el sol de vaya, como mi padre 
A caballo camino, recorro, disfruto 
Y admiro mi tierra linda y morena 
Veo la viña, la alfalfa, el maíz, el arroz
El trigal, su verde nogalera 

Cuando estoy en el campo, veo las estrellas 
Y al mirarlas recuerdo, cosas muy bellas 
A mi padre, a mi madre, a mis tíos
Mi hermano, mi abuelo y mi abuela 
Me imagino que toda mi gente que vive en mí siempre 
Son toditas ellas 

Y yo no voy de aquí, aquí me voy a quedar 
Y yo no me voy de aquí, aquí me voy a quedar",Cuando Estoy en el Campo
Juan Gabriel,"Necesito un buen amor
Porque ya no aguanto más
Veo la vida con dolor
Quítenme esta soledad

Necesito que alguien me haga compañía
Ya no quiero noches que son de agonía
Yo no tengo nada, nadie todavía
Y yo necesito que alguien me reviva, escuchen

Ay qué soledad, ay qué soledad
Ay qué soledad, ay qué soledad
Porque es que más, no puedo
No es bueno, no debo
No quiero llamar soledad
Yo espero, yo busco
Yo quiero amor encontrar
Si en el mundo hay tanta gente diferente
Una de esa tanta gente me amará
Alguien, alguien ay, ya
Pero esta soledad debe no crecer
Esta soledad irse debe de

Me ata, me araña
Me muerde, me daña, me hiere de más
Me enferma, me hunde
Me quema, me mata al final

Y antes de que acabe con mi vida debo hallar un salida inmediatamente
Alguien, alguien ay, ya 
Pero esta soledad debe no crecer
Esta horrible soledad irse debe de

Dale

Debo hacerlo todo con amor
Hoy esta noche yo saldré a algún bar
Si no me escapo de ella, va a acabar con esta fuerza de voluntad
Y me va dejar toda el alma enferma
Ay es que debo hacerlo todo con amor
Quizá esta noche sea mi noche ya
Quiero sentirme vivo una vez más
Este caso en realidad es de vida o muerte
Necesito un buen amor urgentemente
Ay, quítenme esta soledad

Yo necesito de alguien, de alguien, de alguien para revivir
Yo necesito de alguien, de alguien, de alguien de alguien para remediar
Yo necesito de alguien, de alguien, de alguien para no morir
Yo necesito de alguien, de alguien, de alguien de alguien para despertar

Ahora

Porque es que más no puedo, no es bueno
No debo, ni quiero ya más soledad
Yo espero, yo busco, yo quiero amor encontrar
Si en el mundo hay tanta gente diferente
Una de esa tanta gente me amará
Alguien, alguien, ay ya
Pero esta soledad debe no crecer
Esta horrible soledad irse debe de

Debo hacerlo todo con amor
Hoy esta noche yo saldré a algún bar
Si no me escapo de ella, va acabar con esta fuerza de voluntad
Parando el corazón

Ay, debo hacerlo, es que debo hacerlo todo con amor
Quizá esta noche sea mi noche ya
Quiero sentirme vivo una vez más
Este caso en realidad es de vida o muerte
Necesito un buen amor urgentemente
Ay, quítenme esta soledad

Debo, puedo y quiero
Tengo el derecho de vivir
Quiero, puedo y debo
Con alguien todo compartir
Ay ay ay, vaya, vaya

Necesito un buen amor
Porque ya no aguanto más
Veo la vida con dolor
Ay, quítenme esta, ay quítenme esta soledad

Necesito que alguien me haga compañía
Ya no quiero noches que son de agonía
Yo no tengo nada, nadie todavía
Y yo necesito que alguien me reviva, escuchen

Vayan
Ay, vayan, vayan
Escuchen
Na na na na na, na na na na na
Ay vaya, vaya
Na na na na na, na na na na na yeah
Vaya, vaya, vaya
Ne ne ne ne ne ne ne ne

Oh no
Oh oh oh, no

Juan Gabriel,"Cuando te beso, me lleno de emoción
Y sólo al sentir tus labios, me sube la pasión 
Y al contemplarte, despierta mi ansiedad
De hacerte feliz un rato, volverte a acariciar 

Gracias amor, porque si me quieres
Porque tú me hiciste ser mejor
Y dame más, que mi alma goza
Haz que yo te insista, dí ámame más

Que no se acabe la magia del placer
Ver el sol nacer y juntos, hasta que muera él 
Más tarde o en la noche, entre olas de la mar 
Podamos vivir un rato, mientras que el sol se va 

Quiero tener, un poco más de ti
Porque quiero hacerte, más mujer 
Te quiero amar, todo el tiempo ahora
Has que me desvista la felicidad 

Gracias amor, porque sí me quieres
Porque tú me hiciste ser, ser mejor
Y dame más, que mi alma goza
Haz que yo te insista, di ámame más","Di, Amame Mas"
Juan Gabriel,"No, no mientas más 
Que lo se todo 
No, no insistas más 
No soy tu tonto

Eso querías pues ya

Juan Gabriel,"Es mi vida y muy mi vida
Y no tengo que, yo dar explicaciones
Yo tengo mis razones que a nadie
Le interesara saber

Es mi vida y muy mi vida
Cada quien es quien
Y viva como viva
Pues cada quien su vida
A nadie le hice daño con hacer

Si desde que yo nací
Siempre he vivido feliz
Nunca quise ser igual
Que los demás
Y así vencí

Cada fracaso de ayer
Siempre fue un triunfo total
Las lagrimas que llore
Fueron de felicidad

Es mi vida y muy mi vida
He vivido así
Nací de una victoria
Que me lleno de gloria
Cuando me dio la vida
Ella empezó mi historia

Me dio luna y estrellas
El cielo, el sol y el mar
La tierra que hoy camino
Y no me canso de andar

Mi vida es muy mi vida
Y el tiempo lo dirá
Si fue o no importante
No ser igual que los demás

Juan Gabriel,"Ya verás cuando me vaya 
El frío que vas a sentir 
Ay ay ay nunca creí que canalla tu me salieras 
Pero si 

Ya verás cuando me busques 
Ay jamás tú me vas a encontrar 
Ay ay ay haz lo que quieras y gustes 
Que mañana lloraras 

Dices que ya no me quieres

Antes de haber terminado 

Ya verás cuando me vaya

Y haber si el te da la talla y aquí te dejo esto yo

Lo metieron a la cárcel por que se robo un chivito 

Al hijo de mi compadre que se llama Margarito 
Lo metieron a la cárcel por que se robo un chivito 

Yo lo acompañe a sacarle mi compadre el juez le dijo 
Señor vengo a suplicarle que perdono usted a mi hijo 

Señor vengo a suplicarle que perdone usted a mi hijo 

El juez le contesto son 45 pesos 
Por menos y más señor aquí tengo muchos presos 

Por menos y más señor aquí tengo muchos presos

Ni volviéndonos a batir

Y salimos de la cárcel para conseguir dinero

Pero su hijo es primero 

Le presto don Abrahán le presto don Efrén 
Le presto don trino don Jesús y don Rafael 
Y lo fue a sacar y le dijo el juez 

Pagaras con cárcel si es que robas otra vez 

No te da pena ver a tu padre que se avergüenza 
No hagas que sufra tu pobre madre muchacho piensa 
No eres rico tampoco pobre 
No es necesario muchacho tonto de que tú robes 

Si quieres algo trabaja y compra 
Al fin y al cabo que aquí en el campo el trabajo sobra",El Hijo de Mi Compadre
Juan Gabriel,"Oye María, escuche el otro día, que te quieres separar, 
Que porque no tiene nombre, lo que te ha hecho ese hombre 
Y que ya no aguantas más

Si te dicen que va y viene, 
Y con otras se entretiene, es pa hacerte sentir mal 
No debes de tú dejar nunca a Juan, no debes tu dejarlo jamás

Oye María, que lo andabas hasta espinado, 
Porque andabas tú buscando saber si te engañara 
Lo que dicen es mentira, no permitas que consigan, 
Verte como ellas está 
La que busca encuentra, tú no andes buscando 
Si el a ti no te quisiera, a tu lado no estuviera y se hubiera ido ya 
La que busca encuentra, tú no andes buscando 
Tu defiende con orgullo el honor de el, sea mentira o sea verdad 
No debes tú de dejar nunca a Juan, no debes tu dejarlo jamás 
No debes tú de dejar nunca a Juan, no debes tu dejarlo jamás

Juan Gabriel,"Al instante cuando te vi
Algo bello por ti sentí
Y eché a volar mi creativa imaginación
Convirtiéndote en ilusión

Poco a poco y sin despertar
Ese sueño hoy es verdad y ahora estoy
A tu ver y por donde vas
Muy seguro contigo voy

Poco a poco, lentamente
Tu fuiste conquistándome
Poco a poco lentamente
Tu fuiste enamorándome

Poco a poco, lentamente
Tu fuiste enseñándome
Poco a poco lentamente
Así me enamoré de ti

Yo veo por tus ojos
Yo voy a tu aire
Confio solamente en ti
Por ti es que no vivo ya, por vivir
Ya no vivo

Y mientras yo viva
Por toda la vida
Yo voy a vivir por ti
Por ti es que no vivo ya, por vivir
Ya no vivo

Lentamente el amor sentí
Despertaste el amor en mi, me enamoré
Ya no vivo más por vivir
No me canso jamás de ti

Tanto amor ahora tengo en mi ser
Hoy de nuevo he vuelto a nacer, y es por ti
Que no siento la soledad
Lo que siento es felicidad

Poco a poco a poquito me fui enamorando
No pude evitarlo, yo te quiero tanto
Pero tanto, tanto, tú bien sabes cuánto
Eso y otro tanto quiero decir
Que ya no vivo por vivir
Que ya no vivo por vivir

Poco a poco a poquito me fuiste enseñando
A besar tus labios, tus ojos, tus manos
Tu cuerpo soñado que tengo en mis brazos
Quiero ser de ti, yo voy a ser de ti
El más grande y dulce amor
El más grande y dulce amor

Poco a poco, lentamente
Me enseñaste a querer
Poco a poco, lentamente
Yo de ti me enamoré

Poco a poco, lentamente
Me enseñaste a vivir

Yo me enamoré de ti

Hoy canto y vivo contento
Porque ahora ya puedo decir que por fin
Ya no vivo por vivir
Ya no vivo (ya no vivo)

Juan Gabriel,"Estoy, pensando en ti
Mirando y oyendo al viejo mar, cantar
Esa canción, que enamoró a la luna

Y estoy imaginándome que estás conmigo
Y un loco suspiro se escapa de mí
Se va en busca de ti, para decirte que te extraño más ahora
Que el día siguiente que te fuiste con la aurora
Aún sigue siendo el día más triste para mí

Y así, pensando en ti, el sol se va
Y yo, un día más sin verte

Y sigo imaginándome que estás conmigo
Despierto, dormido, y a diario es así

Y hoy tengo para ti, caricias nuevas que guarde luna tras luna
Para estrenarlas en tu ser, una por una
Hasta que jures que jamás te iras de mí
Y hoy tengo para ti, caricias nuevas que guarde luna tras luna
Para estrenarlas en tu ser, una por una
Hasta que jures que jamás te iras de mí
Hoy tengo para ti, caricias nuevas que guarde luna tras luna
Para estrenarlas, en tu ser, una por una
Hasta que jures que jamás te iras de mí
Hoy tengo para ti, caricias nuevas que guarde luna tras luna
Para estrenarlas, en tu ser, una por una
Hasta que jures que jamás te iras de mí",Luna Tras Luna
Juan Gabriel,"Que triste es saber ,que todo termino 
Que tiste es decirle a un amor adios 
Si tu lo comprendieras no te irias asi 
Y ubieramos logrado la felicidad 

Mañana, mañana sera un dia muy triste 
Por que tu te iras y no volveras ya jamas a mi lado 
Mañana, mañana sera un dia muy triste 
Y el sueño de amor que vivimos tu y yo 
Ya lo habras olvidado 

Ya no quiero pedirte que te quedes mas 
Ni quiero preguntarte para donde vas 
Solamente yo vengo a decirte adios 
Que tengas mucha suerte y asta nunca amor

Juan Gabriel,"Prueba de amor, eso es lo que quieres
Te voy a entregar, hoy mismo, si lo prefieres 
No voy a fingir, al darle a tus labios
La tierna humedad, más suave, que un murmullo 

Espero inventar la magia de amar
Donde toda la magia será azul 
Te voy a enamorar, de ti con sinceridad
Y mi felicidad, será el saberte amar 
Di que me quieres, que sientes, sientes lo que yo 
Que esto es más que amor 

Qué tonto fui yo, cuando me reí de ti 
Yo nunca pensé, ni a veces, que iba a entregarme 
Perdóname tú y hazme de tu noche 
Enciéndeme tú la hoguera, verás cómo arde 

Espero inventar la magia de amar
Donde toda la magia será azul 
Te voy a enamorar, de ti con sinceridad
Y mi felicidad, será el saberte amar 
Tú di que me quieres, que sientes, sientes lo que yo 
Que esto es más que amor 
Tú di que me quieres, que sientes, sientes lo que yo 
Que esto es más que amor 

Que esto es más que amor",Mas Que Amor
Juan Gabriel,"Como ha cambiado mi pueblo 
Mi pueblo ya no es el mismo 
De aquel pueblo tan hermoso 
Al de hoy hay un abismo 

Ya no hay mujer con rebozos 
Ya no hay hombres campesinos 
Ya el cántaro no va al pozo 
Lo rompió el industrialismo 

Ya se contamino el agua 
De las acequias y ríos 
Ya se seco un ojo de agua 
Ya cerraron el molino 

Ya la mujer no usa enaguas 
Ni el hombre calzón de indio 
Ya la mujer no usa el habla 
Ni el hombre su civismo 

Ya las casitas de adobe 
Están desapareciendo 
Hoy las construyen de bloque 
Feas las están haciendo 

La plata y el oro del pobre 
Caros se han ido poniendo 
Ya no hay monedas de cobre 
De níquel hoy vienen siendo 

Ya no oigo tocar la banda 
De los Suárez y sus hijos 
Que triste se ve la plaza 
Los sábados y los domingos 

Ya hay otras clases de bandas 
Ya no hay quioscos ni estanquillos 

Ya la gente del campo se ha ido 
A emprender una nueva aventura 
A los campos de estados unidos 
Con tristeza y quizás amargura 
De saber que en su pueblo han perdido 
El ingenio el molino y cordura 

Pocos vuelven de haya y yo he venido 
Y lo encuentro cambiado y no hay duda 

De que ya no es aquel pueblo chiquito 
Que inspiraba añoranza y ternura 
Ya no es aquel pueblo bonito 
El comercio le trajo basura 

Aquel tiempo se hablaba de ranchos 
De la milpa y la tabla de arroz 
De la musica, el baile y el canto 
Del padre la madre y de dios 
De la siembra y cosecha del campo 
De la casa el lugar y el amor 

Ahora hablan de que hay terrorismo 
Del peso y su devaluación 
Ahora hablan con tal pesimismo 
De que hay viene otra revolución 
Ahora en vez de mirarse ellos",El México Que Se Nos Fue
Juan Gabriel,"Me dices que te vas, y estoy muy triste 
Porque de aquel amor que me tuviste 
Ya todo se acabó de un de repente 
Y hoy quieres empezar con otra gente 
Que un nuevo y gran amor tú te encontraste 
Que adoras y que él también te adora 
Recuerda que eso igual, tú me juraste 
Que bien se te olvidó, todito ahora 

Mi tata Dios que te perdone 
Él sabe que yo te perdoné 

Que no te guardaré, jamás rencores 
Porque eres el amor, de mis amores 
Yo no te tomo a mal, lo que decidas 
Es muy tu libertad y muy tu vida 
Adiós querido amor, que seas dichosa 
Que veas la vida en él, color de rosa 
Y nunca tú por mí, te me entristezcas 
Ya vete de una vez, no te detengas 

Porque yo, muy pobre soy tú lo sabes bien 
Gano seis pesos, tú quieres cien 
Y yo no puedo 
Y aunque yo trabajo mucho no puedo más 
Yo soy de campo y él de ciudad 
Pero aquí me quedo 

Mil gracias corazón, por todo aquello 
Jamás te olvidaré, porque fue bello 
Adiós querido amor, Dios te bendiga 
Que seas feliz con él toda la vida 

Porque yo, nací en el campo y en él crecí 
A ningún lado me quiero ir, ni Dios lo quiera 

Soy feliz, de sol a sol trabajando así 
Porque en el campo está el porvenir 
Y aquí es mi tierra, esta es mi tierra 
Mi bendita tierra",Mi Bendita Tierra
Juan Gabriel,"Me va a llevar la tristeza de tanto pensar en ti 
Ya me duele la cabeza, Dios apiádate de mí 
Me va llevar la tristeza, eso sé muy bien que sí 

Voy a vagar por el mundo, a ver si puedo arrancarte 
Voy a hacerme vagabundo quiero aprender a olvidarte 
Voy a vagar por el mundo pero no para encontrarte 

Siempre te traigo en mi mente, no te me puedes borrar 
Te adoro como un demente y cada día es mucho más 
Siempre te traigo en mi mente, y no sé ni en dónde estás 

Ha de pasar mucho tiempo, quizá no he de olvidarte 
Moriré de sentimiento pero nunca iré a buscarte 
Ha de pasar mucho tiempo, pero no voy a rogarte 

No quiero verte otra vez, eres mal agradecida 
Te fuiste pa´no volver, me dejaste muerto en vida 
No quiero verte otra vez, hija de la mala vida",Muerto en Vida
Juan Gabriel,"Desde el dia que tú te fuiste
Todo para mí es tan triste, tanto que yo ya no espero nada
Que volvieras a mi lado era mi sueño dorado
Y de eso ya perdí las esperanzas

Y todas mis illusiones tuve que hacerlas canciones
Pero después de tanto cantarlas
Me he llenado de tristeza de los pies a la cabeza
Tanto que hoy me duele mucho el alma

Muriendo de amor
Muriendo de amor
Muriendo de amor, por ti

Yo sigo amándote tanto mi amor
Que no me resigno aún 
A ser tu olvido y tu adiós
Que te olvide, eso es lo que quieres tú

Cómo hacer si jamás yo viví ni sentí nada igual?
Es la primera ocasión que siento soledad
Nunca me enamoré, ni viví, ni sentí tanto amor
Siempre pensé que era bello el amor y no dolor

Y tú me estás mantando lento así
Muriéndome de amor por ti
Estoy muriendo

Hoy es todo tan distinto, ya no vivo, sólo existo
Qué va hacer de mi mañana?
Cómo puede ser posible?
Cómo tanto que te quise que ahora no te importe nada, nada

Y hoy no vienes a ayudarme
Hoy no vienes a salvarme, eres mal agradecida
Que después de haberte dado tanto y de entregarme enamorado
Ahora me quedas amiga

Muriendo de amor
Muriendo de amor
Muriendo de amor, por ti

Y sigo amándote tanto mi amor, que no me resigno aún
A ser tu olvido y tu adiós, que te olvidé
Eso es lo que quieres tú

Cómo hacer si jamás yo viví ni sentí nada igual?
Es la primera ocasión que siento soledad
Nunca me enamoré, ni viví, ni sentí tanto amor
Siempre pensé que era bello el amor y no dolor

Juan Gabriel,"Es difícil aceptar que me tenga que quedar
Algún día siN usted
Pero así que ser tendrá
Yo quisiera que jamás
Pero mía usted no es

Pero qué necesidad
Para qué tanto problema
No hay como la libertad de ser, de estar, de ir
De amar, de hacer, de hablar
De andar así sin penas

Pero qué necesidad
Para qué tanto problema
Mientras yo le quiero ver feliz, cantar, bailar
Reír, soñar, sentir, volar
Ellos le frenan

Pero mientras llegue el día
Me imagino que es mía
Y más le amo cada vez
Y aprovecho tiempo y vida a su amor aunque a escondidas
Nos tengamos ya que ver

Pero qué necesidad
Para qué tanto problema
No hay como la libertad de ser, de estar, de ir
De amar, de hacer, de hablar
De andar así sin penas

Pero qué necesidad
Para qué tanto problema
Mientras yo le quiero ver feliz, cantar, bailar
Reír, soñar, sentir, volar
Ellos le frenan

Sé muy bien que sus papás más y más le pedirán
De que me deje de querer
Noche a noche rezarán
Día a día le dirán
Que eso que hace no está bien

Pero qué necesidad
Para qué tanto problema
No hay como la libertad de ser, de estar, de ir
De amar, de hacer, de hablar
De andar así sin penas

Pero qué necesidad
Para qué tanto problema
Mientras yo le quiero ver feliz, cantar, bailar
Reír, soñar, sentir, volar
Ellos le frenan

Y quizás hasta querrán que me lleve para allá

Daño yo no le hago al verle
Con amarle y con tenerle
Más que un daño le hago un bien

Para qué tanto problema
No hay como la libertad de ser, de estar, de ir

Juan Gabriel,"Una diosa desde el cielo un día bajo
a conocer como vivía un pecador
la vi bajando lentamente en una estrella
y su mirada luminosa me observo
tome su mano y recorrimos el mundo
y al ver el mar con el cielo confundió
corte una rosa y la coloque en su pelo
y entonamos una canción para dos

que decía
que bello es el mundo
que bello es el amor
que bellas las flores
que grande el sé
mira las más
los atardeceres y los arreboles
que lindos paisajes de bellos colores a tu alrededor
y los manantiales que en las noches claras sirven de espejitos
a los luceritos que curiosos miran su propio fulgor 

Se había escapado del reino de la pureza
no conocía lo que era el amor
emocionado la tome entre mis brazos
y estampe un beso en sus labios con pasión
mi linda diosa y yo aquel día nos amamos
y desde el cielo un arco iris bajo
había un mensaje del creador que nos decía
si son felices reciban mi bendición

y decía
que bello es el mundo
que bello es el amor
que bellas las flores
que grande el sé( bis )
mira las más

Es por ti

Ahora es que me entero que hay amor
Y eso es maravilloso para mí
Saber que no estoy solo 
Que mío es nada y todo
Que debo porque puedo si es que quiero ser feliz 
Y ahora es que me entero, que hay un sol

Y al final un beso 
Que hasta ayer 
Fue sabor de olvido 
Porque hoy, yo también me voy 

Cuantas veces, yo te suplique 
Que volvieras pronto, junto a mí 
Pero tú jamás, quisiste oír 
Esta imploración 

Aquel día cuando te fuiste 
Sentí tan frió el adiós 
Te esperaba, lloraba tanto 
Y sin embargo yo seguía 
Callando mi dolor 

Pero hoy, no quiero, mas seguir 
Con el sacrificio, de esperar 
Si hubieras querido, regresar 
Lo hubieras hecho ya 

No, no te preocupes, por volver 
Pues todo ha cambiado en la ciudad 
Hoy es tan distinto, frío y gris 
Que hasta yo me voy 

El día que te fuiste tú 
Llore sin fin el adiós 
Y al ver que no volvías más 
Seguí callando mi dolor

Juan Gabriel,"Te quiero tanto amor, te quiero tanto, te quiero 
Porque tú me das ese cariño sincero 
De amor que en el mundo , ya casi no hay y te juro 
Que todo ese amor lo voy a guardar dentro de mi corazón

Juan Gabriel,"Tú serás un dulce recuerdo 
Que llevaré siempre en mi vida 
Que llevaré dentro de mí

Yo seré tu más grande olvido 
Seré tan solo una aventura 
Y negarás que fui tu amante

Conforme pasa el tiempo 
Tú irás olvidando cada vez, ah 
Yo en cambio seguiré recordando tu gran amor 
Sin olvidar, ah 
Yo en cambio seguiré recordando tu gran amor 
Sin olvidar

Sin olvidar que viví los días más grandes 
De mi vida y las noches 
Que inventamos yo las guardo 
Y tú las olvidas yo las guardo 
Tú las olvidas yo las guardo 
Todavía

Tú sigue olvidando 
Yo sigo recordando 
No me importará tu olvido

Juan Gabriel,"Adiós, le estoy diciendo a mi mejor amigo
Adiós, tu ten en cuenta que la suerte está contigo
Adiós que la salud abunde en tu camino
Que al final encuentres la dicha
La paz y la alegría
Y el amor que siempre has merecido

Adiós y que realices todo lo que tú has soñado
Adiós que siempre el triunfo lo encuentres
En tus manos
Adiós y muchas gracias por la amistad
Que tú me has dado

En mi cuenta con este respeto
Esta a mistad que yo te ofrezco es sincera
Aquí está mi mano

El que tiene un amigo, tiene un tesoro

Adiós y muchas gracias por la amistad
Que tú me has dado
En mi cuenta con este respeto
Esta a mistad que yo te ofrezco es sincera
Aquí está mi mano

Que te vaya bien cuídate mucho

Juan Gabriel,"Porque no me comprendes, vida mía 
Que no estoy, dispuesto hacer esclavo 
De esta horrible soledad 

Porque no me comprendes, vida mía 
Que si te vas se harían frías mis noches 
Piénsalo un poquito más 

No, no 
No quiero que te vayas 
No quiero que me dejes 
No me dejes, no 

Aquí postrado de rodillas 
Quiero que me digas cual fue la razón 

No 
No quiero que te vayas 
Bastante ya he sufrido 
Por conseguir tu amor 

Por dios, amor yo te lo pido 
Que no eches al olvido 
Lo que hubo entre tú y yo 

Aun es tiempo vida 
Pues después no vaya hacer 
Que cuando tú regreses 
A mi lado ya no este 

Y tengas que llorar 
Como hoy me encuentro, junto a ti 
Por eso y otras cosas 
Que te van hacer sufrir 

No, no 
No quiero que te vayas 
No quiero que me dejes 
No me dejes, no 

Aquí postrado de rodillas 
Quiero que me digas cual fue la razón 

No 
No quiero que te vayas

Que no eches al olvido 
Lo que hubo entre tú y yo 

No, amor",Non Quiero Que Me Dejes
Juan Gabriel,"No creas que te he olvidado 
No he aprendido a olvidar 
Lo único, que consigo 
Es que cada noche, te extraño más 

El tiempo, irá cambiando 
Pero este amor mío, no puede cambiar 
Todo el día me lo paso 
Mirando tu retrato 
Ya, ya no puedo más 

Yo no he podido ni un momento ser feliz 
Nada me divierte si no estas aquí 
Yo no he podido ni un momento ser feliz 
Nada me divierte, si no estas amor 

No creas que te he olvidado 
No he aprendido a olvidar 
Lo único que consigo 
Es que cada noche, te extraño más 

Trate, caminando lejos 
Mas fue imposible, no puedo olvidar 
Fue más triste mi regreso 
Me doy cuenta que te quiero 
Mucho, más y más 

Yo no he podido ni un momento ser feliz 
Nada me divierte, si no estas amor 
Yo no he podido ni un momento ser feliz 
Nada me divierte, si no estas amor",Nu Puedo Olvidar
Juan Gabriel,"Yo busco el sol en una nube 
Y busco tu amor a través de tus ojos 
Rosenda no llores, espera el amor 
Yo se que lo esperas, tanto como yo

Te dice te quiero 
Te dice te amo 
Te dice me muero 
Rosenda no llores, espera el amor

Juan Gabriel,"Que dolor, que tristeza, tan grande
Al haberme ofendido, esta vez
Yo que nunca, pensé, ofenderte
Y esta vez tu me ofendes, porque

Tú que fuiste feliz a mi lado
Y conmigo nada te falto
Yo quisiera, saber, el motivo
Porque nuestro amor termino

Y yo que me estaba acostumbrado
De momento, todo terminó
Me ofendiste, hasta que lloraste
Y por eso sufro mi dolor

Tú que fuiste feliz a mi lado
Y conmigo nada te falto
Yo quisiera, saber, el motivo
Porque nuestro amor terminó

Tú que fuiste feliz a mi lado
Y conmigo nada te falto
Yo quisiera, saber, el motivo
Porque nuestro amor terminó",Tu Que Fuiste
Juan Gabriel,"Cuando volverás a México otra vez 
Cuando volverás de nuevo cuando te veré 
Cuando volverás ya quiero vivir feliz 
Hay que soledad, que triste es la ciudad sin ti 

Que soledad que tristeza 
Tan grande siento en el alma 
Que soledad si tu no estas amor, amor 
Cuando volverás, cuando volverás, cuando volverás 

Cuando volverás a México otra vez 
Cuando volverás de nuevo cuando te veré 

Que soledad que tristeza 
Tan grande siento en el alma 
Que soledad si tu no estas amor, amor

Juan Gabriel,"Cuánta siembra hay en el campo 
Que de agua lleva el rió 
Qué chulo se ve mi rancho 
Esta vez sí que ha llovido 

¿Sabes por qué? 
Porque me encantas 
Cuando me dices cuanto me quieres 
El cielo canta 

Bonito el amanecer 
Oye y de los pajaritos 
Contentos por ver nacer 
Otro día pa’ tus ojitos 

¿Sabes por qué? 
Porque me gustas 
Y no te digo cuanto cariño santo 
Porque te asustas 

Que hermosa quedó la casa 
Del ranchito tuyo y mío 
Que bueno que la pintamos 
De blanco con amarillo 

¿Sabes por qué? 
Porque te amo 
Todos los animales 
Corren o vuelen son mis hermanos 

Que bien quedo el portal 
Con sus lindas bugambilias 
A mí las que me gustan 
Son las lila y amarrillas 

¿Sabes por qué? 
Porque te quiero 
Tanto que si te vas 
Y no vienes pronto me desespero 

Qué chula se ve la luna 
Colgando allá en la montaña 
Que lindo es amanecer 
Junto a ti cada mañana 

¿Sabes por qué? 
Porque me amas 
Así se pone bonito 
Todito el campo y la sabana

Juan Gabriel,"(Hechos son amores y no buenas razones) 

Siempre tienes que mentir, eres una mentirosa
La verdad es una cosa, que a ti no te gusta oír 
Contigo un hay nada que hacer, todo lo ves un problema
Contigo y con tatas penas, nadie podría vivir 
En ti, y en mí, nada puede suceder, no te hagas más ilusiones 
Con tus celos y pasiones, no te veo con porvenir
En ti, y en mí, cariño no puede haber, a mi me sobran razones 
Y es que tú no te compones, ni volviéndote a batir 

(Como dijo mi tía, María de Jesús, la de Uruapan
Para hablar y comer pescado, hay que tener cuidado) 

Tu tienes el corazón, muy dado a los sufrimientos 
Y te doy un buen consejo, lo tomas como agresión 
Tú siempre que a mí me ves, me miras con desconfianza 
Y la duda te entra con ansias, donde hay celos no hay amor 
En ti, y en mí, nada puede suceder, no te hagas más ilusiones 
Con tus celos y pasiones, no te veo con porvenir
En ti, y en mí, cariño no puede haber, a mi me sobran razones 
Y es que tú no te compones, ni volviéndote a batir 
En ti y en mí",Donde Hay Celos
Juan Gabriel,"Tanto daño yo te hice, que ya no puedo pedirte 
Ni otra oportunidad 
Porque aquella que me diste, la verdad aunque es muy triste 
No la supe aprovechar 

Ya no puedo detenerte, se que voy ahora a perderte 
Y que nada puedo hacer 
Todo ahora se me acaba, si yo fuera tú te daba 
Lo que quieras por volver 

Para qué quieres que vuelva, si por ti no siento nada 
Para qué quieres que vuelva, yo de ti ya estoy cansada 

Que pena si tú no vuelves, pero no quiero que te quede 
Un mal recuerdo de mí
Dos favores yo te pido, que me dejes ser tu amigo 
Y me perdonas, quiero oír 

Para qué quieres que vuelva, ya no estoy enamorada 
Para qué quieres que vuelva, si de ti ya estoy cansada 

Te lo pido por favor 
Si quieres tu amiga soy, pero ya no volveré",Dos Favores

Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! por qué te vas 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! cómo me puede 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! no volverás 

Se acabó nuestra historia de amor 
Le llegó a nuestra gloria el dolor 
Y lo nuestro acabó y ahora tuvo el fin 
Nos faltó cultivar nuestra flor 
Se calló el canto del ruiseñor 
Ni un recuerdo quedó como souvenir 

Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! cómo te amo 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! qué voy a hacer 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! cómo me calmo 
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! qué padecer 

Se perdió lo que había de valor 
Hoy hay frío donde hubo calor 
Ya vendrá quien encienda la luz en mí 
Que la suerte hoy esté a tu favor 
Que bendiga tu senda el creador 
Y ojalá corazón seas muy feliz

Juan Gabriel,"Una mujer rechazada 
Es más peligrosa 
Que un animal salvaje 
Debes tener cuidado hijito mío 
Pa' que no te pase 
Lo que le pasó, a un cuñado mío 
Dejó a su mujer 
Como deja el río 
El agua correr 
Por el sembradío

El ya estaba cansado 
De tantos celos de tanta intriga 
Y un día se fue a la mar 
Se metió a nadar 
Conoció a una amiga 
Que le hizo cantar 
Y olvidar su pena 
Y se enamoró de esa mujer buena 
Y así se salvó 
De esa cruel condena

Se fueron baile y baile 
Baile y que baile 
A San Juan pueblito 
Y ahí miro la mañana 
Y una gitana de ojos bonitos 
Que le dijo ven 
Por una moneda 
Te voy a decir lo que a ti te espera 
Vas hacer feliz 
Como tú antes eras

Ámense tal como son 
El que persevera alcanza 
Donde celos no hay amor 
No se tengan desconfianza 
No se dejen engañar 
Porque todo es por demás

Nadie es de nadie 
No se les olvide 
Que hombre y mujer 
Han nacido libres

La otra te pide que vuelvas 
Mas que pronto a su lado 
Pero tú estas de esta otra 
Totalmente enamorado

Te dice que la perdones 
Todo lo que ella te hizo 
Tú no eres rencoroso 
Ni tampoco olvidadizo

Ay, no, no, no 
Quién va a volver 
Ni loco que yo estuviera 
Que volver, ni que volver

Ay, no, no, no 
Quien va a volver 
Ni que en este mundo hubiera 
Nada más que esa mujer

Aquella es una testaruda 
Ignorante y prepotente 
Caprichosa y corajuda 
Mal pensada e imprudente

Esta en cambio es amorosa 
Intuitiva, inteligente 
Servicial y cariñosa 
Y además es obediente

Ay, no, no, no 
Quién va a volver 
Ni loco que yo estuviera 
Que volver, ni que volver

Ay, no, no, no 
Quién va a volver 
Ni que en este mundo hubiera 
Nada más que esa mujer",La Gitana
Juan Gabriel,"Yo tengo el presentimiento 
De que tú ya no me quieres 
Ven a sacarme de dudas 
Por favor 

Pues desde que tú te fuiste 
Ninguna carta has mandado 
Si vives o ya no existes, que se yo 

Pero este presentimiento 
Me esta haciendo más sufrir 
Parece una incertidumbre 
Estar pensando mal de ti 

Los celos me están matando 
Yo no he podido ser feliz 
Y cada noche es lo mismo 
Y cada noche es lo mismo, ay 
Que no me deja dormir 

Mi vida por si me escuchas 
Sabrás que yo aún te quiero 
Que todavía te espero 
Que aquí estoy 

Muchos te hablarán de amores 
Pero todo eso es mentira 
Aquí esta la vida mí­a 
Si tú quieres te la doy 

Pero este presentimiento 
Me está haciendo más sufrir 
Parece una incertidumbre 
Estar pensando mal de ti 

Los celos me están matando 
Yo no he podido ser feliz 
Y cada noche es lo mismo 
Y cada noche es lo mismo, ay 
Que no me deja dormir",La Incertidumbre
Juan Gabriel,"Juntos 
Haremos tantas cosas en la vida 
Tu y yo nacimos uno para el otro 
El mundo solamente es de los dos 

Juntos 
No importa que la gente nos critique 
De todos modos hablan, toman, dicen 
Que juzguen como quieran este amor 

Juntos 
Veras que con el tiempo venceremos 
A nadie hacemos daño con querernos 
Solo al que no le guste ser feliz 

Juntos 
Hasta que alguno de los dos se muera 
Y aun cuando estemos los dos bajo tierra 
Ni así este gran amor a de morir 

Juntos 
Sigamos siempre así hasta el fin del mundo 
Ya vez que el mar azul es tan profundo 
Pues mas profundo es nuestro gran amor, 
Claro que si, ¡ey! ¡ey! 

Juntos 
Ya vez que el sol, la luna y las estrellas 
La misma vida en si que es tan bella 
Pues todavía es mas bello es nuestro amor

Juan Gabriel,"Nunca pensé que me amaras 
Como iba yo a pensarlo 
Si cada vez que te hablaba 
Te reías tu de mi 

Por eso nunca me creí 
Cuando amigos me contaban 
Que cuando a solas te encontrabas sin mi 
Llorabas así 

Nena ay¡ caramba, caramba que pena 
El amor que yo sentía por ti 
Corrió atrás de ti cayo 

Nena ay¡ caramba, caramba que pena 
Tu mirabas para el cielo feliz 
Pero en el suelo estaba yo 

Y mi amor no te lo di 
Me quede con el muy triste 
Hasta que lo vi morir 
Cuando con otro te fuiste 

Por eso nunca me creí 
Cuando amigos me decían 
Hay tu sufriendo te veían por mi 
Y hoy me toca a mi reír 

Nena ay¡ caramba, caramba que pena 
Muchas veces te lo dije mujer 
Que no fuera mas ingrata 

Nena ay¡ caramba, caramba que pena 
Disparaste, te fallo y te salió 
El tiro por la culata 

Hoy tu orgullo ya lo vez 
En llanto se han convertido 
Le pedías al santo aquel 
Y nada te ha concedido 

Y mi dignidad ya vez 
En canción se convirtió 
De que tanto te reías ayer 
Si ahora estas peor que yo 

Nena ay¡ caramba, caramba que pena 
Muchas veces te lo dije mujer 
Lo que se debe, se paga 

Nena ay¡ caramba, caramba que pena 
Que te sirva de experiencia esta vez 
Y no vuelvas a ser mala",Nena Que Pena
Juan Gabriel,"Un día que andaba en el campo 
Me encontré con el eterno 
Y me dijo que el cante y baile 
Se va aire al infierno 

Como yo se ver profundo 
Suelo ver la realidad 
Yo veo dar vueltas a este mundo 
Y muy triste ala humanidad 
Sufre, pide y llora 
No sabe de donde viene 
Quien es y a donde va 

Marmolego, vargaz, y villa 
Le dijeron al buen dios. 
Vamos hacerte un mariachi. 
Del cual saldrán mas de dos 

Yo no quiero verles tristes 
Yo quiero verles alegres 
No quiero verles sufriendo 
Contentos yo quiero verles 

Yo no quiero que me pidan 
Porque todo les he dado 
Quiero que canten y bailen 
Porque así estoy a su lado 
Pedir no es bueno dar si 
Yo quiero que cante y baile 
Todo aquel que crea en mi 

La música viene del pueblo 
La canción viene del hombre 
La alegría nace del pueblo 
Y mariachi tiene por nombre 

La música es tan divina 
Que ala gente enferma sana 
La gente cuando esta sana canta y baila 
Mas cuando ama. 

Todo lo que hay en la vida 
Es por causa y por efecto 
Miren su naturaleza 
No tiene ningún defecto 
Igual es en cada hombre 
En cada ser en este mundo 
Nunca sufran, nunca lloren 
Que la vida es un segundo

Miren México, 
México si es lindo 
México es encantador 
Y todo por sus artistas, su marichi y su folclor 
Cantando y bailando siempre, 
Hagan la paz no hagan la guerra 
Porque cantando y bailando 
Yo puse a girar la tierra 

Pelear no es bueno, amar si 
La música une a los pueblo 
Y los pueblos se une ami. 
Todo aquel que cante y baile 
Al infierno no ha de ir 

Para que pelean tanto 
En tantas y tantas guerra 
Les diré una adivinanza 
A ver quien me la adivina 
Aquel que me la adivine, 
Es que el mariachi le fascina 

Que quiere decir mariachi, 
Quien me lo puede decir? 
Quiere decir día de fiesta 
En la lengua otomi 

La música viene del pueblo 
La canción viene del hombre 
La alegría nace del pueblo 
Y mariachi tiene por nombre",El Principio

Tu me diste el corazón

Que lo llevo a donde vaya
Por que tiene una razón

Es un lindo y buen recuerdo 
De aquel sueño, que yo tuve 

Y por culpa del destino
Realizarlo yo no pude 

Santa Monica, es la playa 
Donde me dejó pensando

No me llama ni me escribe
Será que me esta olvidando

Que se fue y ya no a venido
Que parece que fue un sueño

Dicen que pa' Zacatecas 
Ya se fue 
Pero otros cuentan
Que anda haya por San Francisco
Que de ves en ves le encuentran

Juan Gabriel,"Fue en un pueblo, fue en un pueblo muy bonito 
Donde Dios creo una estrella, la más grande de mi patria, 
De mi patria Mexicana, 
Fue en Rosario Sinaloa, donde Dios creo a mi Lola 
Y la lleno de sentimiento, voz amor y temperamento, 
Y hoy por el mundo se tremola, el nombre de Lola, 
Lola la Grande, Lola La Reina, que viva Lola 

Cucurrucucú, (Cucurrucucú), paloma, Cucurrucucú, no llores, 
Dicen que por las noches nomás se le iba en puro llorar 
Dicen que no dormía, nomás se le iba en puro tomar 
Juran que le mismo cielo, se estremecía al oír su llanto 
Como sufrió por ella, que hasta en su muerte la fue llamando 
Cucurrucucú, paloma, Cucurrucucú, no llores 

Ya me canso, de llorar y no amanece, 
Ya no se si maldecirte o por ti rezar 
Tengo miedo, de buscarte y de encontrarte 
Donde, me aseguran, mis amigos, que te vas 
Hay momentos en que quisiera, mejor rajarme 
Y arrancarme ya los clavos de mi penar 
Pero mis ojos, se mueren, sin mirar tus ojos 
Y mi cariño, con la aurora te vuelve a esperar 

Revoloteando el nido destruido, un gorrioncillo pecho amarillo 
Con sus alitas casi sangrando, su pajarita anda buscando 
Cuando se cansa, se para y canta, hasta parece que esta llorando 
Luego se aleja y se va cantando, solo Dios sabe, si va llorando 

Mientras que las vaquillas son, en el tentadero 
Única y nada mas, nada mas, pa los toreros 
Por fuera del redondel, por cierto de piedras hecho 
Sentado llora un chiquillo, sentado llora en silencio 
Con su muletilla enjuga sus lágrimas de torero, 
Con su muletilla enjuga sus lágrimas de torero, 
De pronto la noche hermosa, ha visto algo y esta llorando 
Palomas, palomas blancas, vienen del cielo y vienen bajando 
Mentiras, si son pañuelos, pañuelos blancos llenos de llanto 
Que caen como blanca escarcha, sobre el chiquillo que ha agonizado 
Silencio, silencio, que nuestra Lola, esta descansando",Homenaje a Lola
Juan Gabriel,"El amor es bello, por que cuando amas 
Al cielo lo miras de otro color 
Todo es diferente, vives más la vida 
Haces cuanto puedes 
Para estar mejor. 

El amor nos duele por que a veces damos 
Todo sin medida, más de una vez 
Por eso es que el alma 
Sufre una gran herida 
Cuando se nos cansa de tanto querer 

El amor es triste, por que un día se acaba 
Cuando menos piensas tal como empezó 
Por que nadie es de uno tarde o temprano 
El amor se aleja, tal como llegó",Obertura (El Amor)

Que mire en tu rostro dentro de la rosa
Tu veías mis ojos yo veía tus labios
Que me in musitaban yo no se que cosa.

Ae aha

La pondre en un rizo de tu hermoso pelo
Y ahora tu me dices si o no me amas
Es una costumbre que tiene mi pueblo
Al decir me gustas y que eres muy guapa.

Ae aha, ae aha, ae aha

Esta Rosa roja, prueba de cariño
Y de tantas cosas que por ti yo siento.

La corto mi mano, la que te acaricia
Con todo mi amor
Con todo mi amor
Con todo mi amor
Con todo mi amor.

Juan Gabriel,"Anoche pensando en ti 
Escuché aquellas melodías 
Que tantos recuerdos me traen 
Y recordé con tanto amor lo que te decía 

Que no tengo dinero 
(Ni nada que dar) 
Y lo único que tengo es 
Coro:(amor para dar) 
Si así tu me quieres 
Coro:(te puedo querer) 
Pero si no puedes 
(Ni modo que hacer) 

Yo no tengo dinero 
(Ni nada que dar) 
Y lo único que tengo es 
(Amor para dar) 
Si así tu me quieres 
(Te puedo querer) 
Pero si no puedes 
(Ni modo que hacer) 

Ahora que te encuentras tan lejos de mi 
Comprendo lo mucho que te quiero yo 
Me siento tan cansado de pensar en ti 
De preguntarme donde estarás 

Me he quedado solo 
(Sin tus besos) 
Estoy solo, triste 
(Abandonado) 
Vida tu eres todo 
(Lo que tengo) 
Y me has dejado solo 
(Estoy llorando) 
Yo le he pedido al cielo 
(Que regreses a mi) 

No se ha dado cuenta que me gusta 
No se ha dado cuenta que le amo 
Que cuando pasa la estoy mirando 
Que estando despierto la estoy soñando 
Que de mi vida ya se ha adueñado 
Que en mis pensamientos ella siempre ha estado 
De esa chica yo estoy enamorado 
No se ha dado cuenta que me gusta 
No se ha dado cuenta que le amo 
De esa chica yo estoy enamorado 

Me dijo un día un amigo 
Que una chica por ahí 
Diciendo andaba que con migo 
Seria mucho muy feliz 
Y dicen que ella me conoce 
Que enamorada de mi esta 
Yo quiero que me la presenten 
Porque yo no se quien sera 
Y estoy ansioso 
Por saber de quien se trata 

Por las mañanas 
Me llama una chica 
De nombre mariana 
Todas las mañanas 
Me dice que me ama 
Todo esto no entiendo 
Palabra que no 

Sera mañana o pasado mañana 
El lunes o el martes 
Sera cualquier dia 
En cualquier instante 
Vendran a tocarme 
Las puertas de mi corazon 

Y olvidare 
El dolor 
Que sufri 
Que llore 
Que vivi 
En aier en la soledad 

Yo no digo que te amo 
Ni tampoco que te extraño 
Cuando no estas aqui 
Ni te digo que te quiero 
Ni te ofresco el mundo entero 
Para que..no se mentir 
Para que digo esas cosas 
Aunque suenen muy hermosas 
Si no he de cumplir 
Yo no te ofresco mi vida 
Pues no se si yo algun dia 
Me vaya a morir 

Mi amor no esta en esas palabras 
Esta adentro de mi alma 
Y con ellos te lo voi a demostrar 
Y asi sin repetirte que te quiero 
Sin ofreserte el mundo entero 
Te daras cuenta que es verdad 

Te voi a enseñar 
Que el amor 
No es para jugar 
Es para querer 
No juegues con migo 
Yo te kiero mucho 
No te lo imaginas 
En fin..en fin. 
Solo dame un poco de tiempo 
Y en cualquier momento lo demostrare 

1,2 y 3 
Y me das solo un beso 
Te vas corriendo 
Yo no se porque 
1,2 y 3 
Y me das otro beso 
Me da pena este amor en juego 
Yo no se si tu me amas encerio 
Mas te advierto que yo no juego 

Te digo que ya estoy enamorado 
Que si mas pienso en ti mas me enamoro 
Que soy el mas feliz del mundo 
Que estando juntos todo es mas hermoso 
Te digo que te quiero y que te amo 
Yo no me cansare de repetirte 
Que te quiero 
Que te amo 
Que te busco y te extraño 
Y que estoy enamorado 

Te quiero, te amo, 
Te digo vida mia que ya estoy enamorado 
Yo te quiero, te amo 
Te digo vida mia que te busco y que te extraño 

I love you, I miss you 
Te digo vida mia que ya estoy enamorado 
I wonth`s, I niss 
Te digo vida mia que ya estoy enamorado 
Yo te quiero, te amo 
Te busco y que te extraño 

Anoche pensando en ti 
Escuche estas melodias 
Que tanto recuerdos me traen 
Y recorde con tanto amor lo que me decia 

Nunka me dejes 
(Nunka me dejes) 
Ahii quiereme mucho 
(Quiereme mucho) 
No sabes cuanto te quiero 
Que mi amor es tan grande que es un deseo 
El estar junto ati 

Yo tan enamorado 
Te lo crei 
(Te lo creii) 

Y ahora llevo por siempre con migo 
Mi linda guitarra 
Yo ya no estoy solo 
Usted me acompaña 

Y ahora llevo por siempre con migo

Yo ya no estoy solo 
Usted me acompaña

Juan Gabriel,"Hay poco amor, entre tú y yo
Y eso es muy triste
Creo que es mejor, que sin rencor
Decidas irte

Es por demás, no me das más
Siempre me dices no
Y la verdad, es que jamás me dices
Te amo yo

Tan solo yo, siempre te doy
Lo que me pides tú
Luego te vas, tardas de más
Y eso es ingratitud

Te tengo que esperar
Hasta el amanecer
Y todo, porque te amo
Nada más

Pero no puedo más
Sé que me cansaré
Es mucho y es que abusas
Tú de más

Es tonto amor, si piensas tú
Que tengo que aguantar
Ya decidí, que yo me voy
Si es que tú no te vas

Es tiempo de que yo también
Me vaya a divertir
Tengo con qué, busco con quién
Ya quiero sonreír

Tan solo yo, siempre te doy
Lo que me pides tú
Luego te vas, tardas de más
Y eso es ingratitud

Te tengo que esperar
Hasta el amanecer
Y todo, porque te amo
Nada más

Pero no puedo más
Sé que me cansaré
Es mucho y es que abusas
Tú de más

",Abuso

Perdona si te digo adiós
Como decirle que te amo
Como decirle que te amo

Yo le dije que no
Yo le dije que no

Soy honesto con ella y contigo
A ella la quiero y a ti te he olvidado
Si tu quieres seremos amigos
Yo te ayudo a olvidar el pasado
No te aferres, ya no te aferres
A un imposible, ya no te hagas
Ni me hagas más daño, ya no

Tu bien sabes
Que no fue mi culpa
Tu te fuiste sin decirme nada
Y a pesar que llore como nunca
Ya no seguías de mi enamorada
Luego te fuiste
Y que regresabas
No me dijiste
Y sin más nada
Por qué no sé
Pero fue así
Así fue

Te brinde la mejor de las suertes
Yo me propuse no hablarte y no verte
Y hoy que has vuelto
Ya ves solo hay nada
Ya no debo, no puedo quererte
Ya no te amo
Me he enamorado
De un ser divino
De un buen amor
Que me enseño
A olvidar
Y a perdonar

Soy honesto con ella y contigo
A ella la quiero y a ti te he olvidado

Soñé con este encuentro 
Ansiaba este momento 
Y hoy que los vuelvo a ver 
Que buena suerte y que divino 
Volverá verles

Que felicidad creía que nunca más 
Yo volvería a encontrarles

Que sorpresa tan grade, los vuelvo a ver

De la única manera que te tengo

Es recordándote 

Me cobijo con tu cuerpo 
Te hago mía en el silencio 
Pero todo es soledad 
Y aunque es todo lo que tengo 

Me conformo con recuerdos 
Ilusiones nada mas 
Solo de eso me sostengo 
Gracias a mi pensamiento 
Que amerindio a no olvidar 

Y aunque es todo lo que tengo 
Me conformo con recuerdos 
Se que nunca volverás. 

Pero mas triste hubiera sido 
El no haberte conocido 
Que seria después de mi 
Es tu modo haber vivido 
Aunque se que soy tu olvido 
Yo no quise pensar así.

On the road to my horizon

Like a rhinestone cowboy

And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

No hay como ella ninguna
Tiene el sol en sus manos
Y en sus pies a la luna

La mujer que me ama
Es de cara muy bella
Veo la fe de mi pueblo
En su manto de estrellas

La mujer que me encanta
Es de España su venia
Ella empera otras tierras
Y en la mía es una reina

La mujer que idolatro
Es la india más pura
Alegría es de mi canto
De mis penas la cura

La mujer que yo supe
Que es la santa más buena
Se llama guadalupe
Se llama guadalupe
Y es mi virgen morena

Que es la santa más buena
Se llama guadalupe

Más allá del cielo 
De la luna llena 
De esos dos luceros 
Más allá del sol 

Más allá del todo 
De ese mar de estrellas 
De esos seis planetas 
De ahí vengo yo 

Entre Mercurio, Urano y Plutón 
Yo tenía un planeta y él era mi hogar 
Pero una guerra que se desato 
Apago la luz 

Alrededor de Saturno quedo 
Mi planeta Tierra en pedazos esta 
Gire y gire en torno de su alrededor 
Ese fue su fin 

Pido que ya 
No apaguen la luz 
Vengan a Xel –ha 
Vengan a Tulúm 
Ya no apaguen la luz 
Vengan a Xcaret
Vengan a Cancún

Otros se marcharon a Volan y Aran

Deseaba con el alma conocerte 
Antes de conocerte ya te amaba 
Nunca desespere por eso al verte 

Con tanta prisa en mí 
Te hable de amores 
Al ver tu juventud y tu belleza 
Robe a tu cuerpo hermoso los candores 
Vi en tus divinos ojos la nobleza 

Amarte es un honor bien de mis noches 
Jamás te dejare hasta que tú digas 
Amor gracias por todo en tus derroches 
La vida te la doy sin que me la pidas 

Gracias por tanto amor cariño santo 
Ojitos de miradas tan hermosas 
Nunca te olvides de lo que hoy te canto

Ayer, ahora y siempre te repetiré 
Lo que yo mas deseo es que el tiempo pare 
Estar contigo es el más bonito edén 
Si algún día tú me dejas dios me ampare

Jamás te dejare hasta que tú digas 
Amor gracias por todo en tus derroches 
La vida te la doy sin que me la pidas

Juan Gabriel,"Cuando tú estás conmigo
Es cuando yo digo
Que valió la pena todo, todo 
Lo que yo he sufrido
No sé si es un sueño aún
O es una realidad
Pero cuando estoy contigo es cuando digo

Que este amor que siento
Es porque tú lo has merecido
Con decirte, amor, que otra vez he amanecido
Llorando de felicidad
A tu lado yo siento que estoy viviendo
Nada es como ayer
Abrázame que el tiemo pasa y él nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame que el tiempo es oro si tú estás conmigo
Abrázame fuerte, muy fuerte, más fuerte que nunca

Siempre abrázame
Hoy que tú estás conmigo
Yo no sé si está pasando el tiempo o tú lo has detenido
Así quiero estar por siempre
Aprovecho que estas tú conmigo
Te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir
Tú cuando mires para el cielo
Por cada estrella que aparezca amor es un ""te quiero""
Abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo
Que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo
Abrázame muy fuerte amor, mantenme así a tu lado
Yo quiero agradecerte, amor, todo lo que me has dado
Quiero corresponderte de una forma u otra a diario

Amor, yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario
Pero a mí me tocó sufrir cuando confié y creí
En alguien que juró que daba su vida por mí
Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y ese no se detiene
Abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene
Abrázame que dios perdona pero el tiempo a ninguno
Abrázame que no le importa saber quién es uno

Será otro día, yo estaré lejos
Cuando el sol salga, mirarás

Todo distinto y se, que llorarás
Cuando amanezca
Cuanta tristeza, tu sentirás

Mañana, cuando estés sola
Y tengas ganas, de estar conmigo
Comprenderás que fue un error

Haberme dicho que me olvidé de tu amor
Y de insistirme que me fuera
Por favor

Antes de que salga el sol, iré muy lejos
Y entre otras calles, de otras ciudades
De otros países, te olvidaré

Me perderé, entre cariños
Entre canciones, entre amistades
Buscando amor, buscando ayuda
Buscando alivio, a este dolor

Y aunque me pidas volver, no volvería
Dios guardé el día, ya no podría
No volvería, volver, ya no

Y aunque me muera, sin tus brazos
Yo no voy a llorar, no voy a sufrir
No le haré mas caso, a mi corazón
Que me pide por Dios, ya vuelva a tu lado",Amor Propio
Juan Gabriel,"Te acuerdas que cuando niño
Yo te llevaba a caballito
Se nos pasaban las horas
Jugando lindo los dos solitos

Ahora tengo un buen caballo
Le puse el rayo, por ser velos
Te llevo a montar ahora
A cualquier hora sólo los dos

Móntate y móntate
Cógete de mi cintura
No teme a su descriatura
Nada más cógete bien

Móntate y móntate
Este si es un buen caballo
Y en menos que canta un gallo
Yo a montar te enseñaré

Caramba mi catalina
Como estas guapa
Y como has creció

Ya veo que contigo el tiempo
Ya estao más grande
Y no sé ha perdido

No te asustes catalina
Que esto yo bien lo sé hacer
Yo ya no soy aquel niño
Y tu estas hecha una mujer

Móntate, móntate
Cógete de mi cintura
No teme a su descriatura
Nada más cógete bien

Móntate y móntate
Este si es un buen caballo
Y en menos que canta un gallo
Yo a montar te enseñaré

Me dijo dale de espacio
Veo que te gusta correr
Si tú no me haces caso
Yo ya no vuelvo a querer

Y agárrate catalina
Que vamos a galopar
Con rumbo hacia la cortina
Donde me voy a bañar

Me dijo mi catalina
Llévame a la soliadero
Voy a enseñarte una cueva
Donde tú entrarás primero

Móntate y móntate
Cógete de mi cintura
No teme a su descriatura
Nada mas cógete bien

Móntate y móntate
Este si es un buen caballo
Y en menos que canta un gallo
Yo a montar te enseñare

Cuando me metí a la cueva
Yo me sentí, como en mi casa
Le dije no tengas miedo
Conmigo nada te pasa

Caramba te gusta el trote
Y es por esa no lo creo
Una yegua a mi caballo
Le enseño ese controleo

Móntate y móntate
Cógete de mi cintura
No teme a su descriatura
Nada mas cógete bien

Móntate y móntate
Este si es un buen caballo
Y en menos que canta un gallo
Yo a montar te enseñare

Y así pasaron las horas
En aquel atardecer
Pero se veía a lo lejos
Como que quería llover

Vámonos, vámonos 
Que empieza a caer la noche
No es bueno que llegues tarde
¡Ay! Tu papá se va ha enojar

Vámonos, vámonos 
Vámonos mi catalina
Ahora lleva tu al caballo
Yo ya te enseñé a montar",Catalina

Como conseguir tu amor

¿Cuanto daño te habrán hecho?
Se muy bien que es por despecho
Que no confías en mi

Inocente de ti
¿Cuantos no te habrán mentido?
¿Cuantos no te habrán herido?
Pero yo no soy así

Yo también fui lastimado
Sé muy bien lo que se siente
Yo también fui inocente

Todo queda en el ayer

Anhelaba tanto
Un amor que no llegó
Siempre lo esperé
Todos mis amigos
Se encontraban
En la misma situación

Y después yo vi
Como iban cambiando
Su manera de vivir
Todos con su amor
Cada uno de ellos
Muy sonrientes muy felices
Menos yo

Y la soledad
Cada vez más triste
Y más oscura yo viví
Y a esa edad
Todos preguntaban los motivos

No recuerdo a quién

Y por curiosidad,
Yo te sigue hasta una iglesia
Te vi muy sola y triste entrar
Te vi postrada ante el altar

Pensé, tal vez sufre por mi
No quise acercarme,
Opté por alejarme

Yo nunca más te recordé,
Seguro estoy que te olvide

Más que antes presente

¿que le has pedido?
Si tu me diste mucho amor
Y a mi muy poco me importó

Todo se quedó en conversaciones
Llenas de ilusiones para recordar
Igual, yo las gracias te doy por tu compañía
Sino pude ser yo tu amor, mala suerte mía

Se fueron, también muchos sueños
Muchas emociones

Tú me prometiste volver, y nada,
De pronto, se te olvido, que te esperaba yo

Dijiste volver un domingo, y domingos llegaron,
Pero ese, bendito domingo, jamás llego
Y me quede aquí esperando contando los días
Llorando las tardes, pasando las noches, sin dormir

Discúlpame, por haberte insistido

Juan Gabriel,"Cancún,
Un mar azul
El si sabe
Curar cualquier pena,
Y mandar los problemas
A navegar

Cancún,
Un mar azul
El si sabe
Al dolor darle alivio 
Y quitar el mal

Cancún,
Un mar azul
Es un brindis por la felicidad

Cancún
Divino Cancún
Muchas gracias
Por dar compañía a mi soledad

Me sano muchas enfermedades
Y aun sin fin de pesares

Rompa de mi la tristeza
Como un huracana",Divino Cancún
Juan Gabriel,"Tú viniste nada más a ilusionarme
Finalmente conseguiste enamorarme
Sucedieron muchas cosas muy hermosas
Muchas otras que no quiero ni acordarme

Cuando tú llegaste a mi yo estaba solo
Y más solo estoy sin ti y más que triste
Me entregue y me acostumbre
A tus maneras de querer
Que ahora estoy mucho peor que cuando viniste.

Tus libros, tus cosas, tus discos, tus fotos, tu ropa
De ti yo no tengo ni un solo recuerdo
Para yo extrañarte un poco.

Todo te has llevado,
Lo que me has dejado es sólo
Pena, tristeza, dolor y quebrantos
Preguntas, suspiros y llanto
Y como compañía a la soledad

Tú llegaste y me encontraste cantando
Tú te fuiste y me dejaste llorando
Yo ahora te pregunto
¿Por qué te has llevado mi felicidad?",Esto No Se le Hace a Nadie
Juan Gabriel,"Todo se acabó, ya no queda nada
De eso que sentimos, de eso que creímos
Con el tiempo tú y yo

Fue por soledad que nos conocimos
Que nos abrazamos, mucho nos besamos
Tú y yo nos quisimos por curiosidad
Todo se quedó en conversaciones
Llenas de ilusiones para recordar
Igual, yo las gracias te doy por tu compañía
Sino pude ser yo tu amor, mala suerte mía

Ni siquiera adiós, nada nos dijimos
Ni nos despedimos, así sucedió
Parece que fue sólo un sueño tanta maravilla
Al fin despertamos tú y yo de esa pesadilla",Me Perdonas
Juan Gabriel,"Hoy que tú estás donde estás ojala me valores
No quiero que sufras, no quiero que llores

Quiero que encuentres amor, todo y cuanto mereces
Que el gran universo te pague con creces

Yo sé muy bien que nunca voy a olvidarte
Yo sé muy bien que tengo que recordarte
Porque contigo la pase muy bien

Que la luz que hay en tus ojos que no se te apague
Que lo que tu tengas, jamás se te acabe

Que tu jamás sientas miedo, tristeza y pesares
Que el éxito siga, triunfa en tus cantares
Que Dios te Bendiga hasta en tus andares

Sabes muy bien que nunca vas a olvidarme
Sabes muy bien que siempre vas a pensar en mi

Porque yo te ame, tu bien sabes cuanto,
Pase lo que pase, estaré pensando en ti, 
Estaré rezando y estaré deseando, seas muy feliz",Pase Lo Que Pase

Yo te quiero conmigo necesito cuidado
Necesito de ti
Si me voy donde vaya yo te llevo conmigo
No me dejes ir solo necesito de ti

Que no vez como te quiero
Y para que me haces sufrir
Que no vez, que más no puedo

Yo nunca,nunca había llorado
Y menos de dolor
Y nunca, nunca había tomado
Y menos por un amor

Por que me haces llorar
Y te burlas de mi

Yo me voy a emborrachar

Juan Gabriel,"Estoy pensando en ti y tú ya estás durmiendo,
Yo sigo sin dormir sin verte te estoy viviendo
Una canción ranchera me lleva hasta tu alcoba
Y al verte me dan celos saber que no estas sola
Pero te adoro siempre a ti y a quien te adore

Sigo pensando en ti en tus ojos de diosa
Y miro sonreír esa boca preciosa
Que me habla sin hablar lo que yo quiero oír
Me dice la verdad me habla sin mentir

A nada dice no y a todo dice si
Y así hago que el amor se te parezca a ti
Te metes en mis brazos, te dos a mor sin prisas
Cubriendo estoy tu cuerpo de una y mil caricias

Quisiera dormirme estoy algo cansado
Estoy sin ti contigo que noche me he pasado
Parece que amanece se apagan las estrellas
Mi cuarto se esclarece y tu sigues siendo bella
Quiero dormir no puedo dormir porque es que tengo
Tantas ganas de amarte y a todas las contengo

Para cuando despiertes y vengas a mi cuarto
Llenarte de mis ansias veras que en dos me parto
Mis ojos cuando lloras tan solo es de alegría
Jamás es de problemas ni de melancolía
Es de mirar lo buena que eres tú conmigo
Yo quiero mas que todo ser tu mejor amigo

Amor a el no le robo y a ti nada te pido
Te doy lo que yo siento de amor agradecido
Así tal cual te adoro tal como eres tú
Y bendita sea la madre que a ti te ha dado la luz",Agradecimiento
Juan Gabriel,"Mi gallo tiene la cresta colorada
Yo le puse el consentido porque 
Él nunca teme a nada
Cuando canta la gallera se alborota 
En todo el rancho, tiene porte, 
Clase y arte y sentimiento hasta en su canto

Aloe aloa, así grita la gente en todito 
El palenque cuando lo ve llegar 
Aloe aloa así grita la gente en todito
El palenque cuando lo ve llegar
Aloe, aloa, así grita la gente en todito 
El palenque cuando lo ve pelear
Aloe, aloa, así grita la gente en todito 
El palenque cuando lo ve ganar

Toquen mariachis, cante la gente, 
Cierren las puertas, hagan sus apuestas, 
Amarren las navajas, empiezan la pelea, 
Suelten a los gallos, 
Unos le van al verde y otros al colorado
El giro es el consentido y el otro es un invitado

Mi gallo es fuerte y valiente
Él es un giro, con las gallinas decentes, 
Y enamores un buen tiro
Él nunca anda presumiendo como andan tantos gallitos
Él sabe bien que viene siendo el papa de los pollitos

Aloe aloa, así grita la gente en todito 
El palenque cuando lo ve llegar 
Aloe aloa así grita la gente en todito

Juan Gabriel,"Por mi boca sabrás que te quiero
Por mis ojos que nada es mentira
Por mis hechos que es amor sincero
Que yo soy para toda la vida por ser tuyo hasta me desespero
Porque tú estás hecha a mi medida

Yo nací nada más que para amarte,
Para darte mi tiempo y mi vida
Yo crecí nada más para darte,
Para hacerte lo que tú me digas
Viviré solo para cuidarte
Nada más falta que me lo pidas

Ay amor, ay amor, dame tus manos, ponlas en mi pecho
Te hablaré derecho preciso saber
Me permites que te quiera mucho
Mírame, háblame, yo te escucho
Tú me gustas mucho pa' que seas mi mujer

Si me duermo es para soñarte
Si despierto es nada más para verte
Es mejor que te vengas conmigo
Sólo sueño en que voy a tenerte
O si quieres me voy yo contigo
Como quieras pero no perderte

No me canso jamás de cantarte
Mis canciones que hablan de quererte
Si te vas sé lo que es extrañarte
Si te veo sé lo que es buena suerte
Si te vas ay mi pecho se parte
Y me causas en vida la muerte

Ay amor, amor, amor ven a mis brazos y abrázame muy fuerte
Deja que te bese de la cabeza a los pies
Voy hacerte un sin fin de locuras
Te diré y te haré las diabluras
Que ni en travesuras hice en mi niñez",De la Cabeza a los Pies

Y a los sentimientos
Que sientes y siento

Me parece todo en la vida bonito

Que yo me siento capaz de seguir
Haciéndome un buen porvenir,
Para compartirlo

Contigo, siempre contigo,
Yo quiero que seas muy feliz, conmigo

Desde la primera vez que estuve
Entre tus brazos comencé
A mirar todo distinto
A sentir lo que es cariño,
Y a escuchar el fiel sonido del amor,
Y a sonreír

Desde que estás tu
Aprovecho el tiempo, hoy vivo el momento,
Dejé de existir

Haciéndome un buen porvenir,

Que felices salíamos al campo
Y en las noches viendo las estrellas,

Es porque tu lo has merecido

Te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir 

Tu cuando mires para el cielo
Por cada estrella que aparezca amor es un ""te quiero"" 

Abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo 
Que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo

Abrázame muy fuerte amor, mántenme así a tu lado 
Yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado, 
Quiero corresponderte de una forma otra a diario
Amor yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario, 
Pero a mi me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí 
En alguien que juró que daba su vida por mi

Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y ese no se detiene 
Abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene 
Abrázame que Dios perdona pero el tiempo a ninguno
Abrázame que no le importa saber quien es uno

Que me estoy muriendo sin tus besos poco a poco de tristeza
Que me estoy muriendo por volverte a ver mi vida

Ya fuera de protocolo
Se lleno de sencillez
Y me dijo, tienes arte
De la cabeza a los pies
Ay chiquillo como escribes!
Que bien bailas cuando cantas
Y como yo soy la infanta
De eso se bastante bien

Quise darle un dulce beso
En sus lindos labios rojos
Y en eso me desperté
Y en eso me desperté

A sido un sueño oh, oh!
A sido un sueño oh, oh!

Solamente ha sido un sueño
Yo jamás seré su dueño
Ella a mi ni me conoce
Solamente fue un saludo

Al cuarto para las doce
En el premiere de “yo soy esa”
De mi comadre Isabel
Que Isabel pues la pantoja
Cual otra mas iba a ser
La mujer que mas se antoja
De besarle hasta los pies
Ella si que tiene arte

Si la viera Fred Astaire
Le dijera baile usted
Mientras yo la veo y la aplaudo
Porque lo hace usted muy bien

Ay, Isabel!, ay, Isabel!, ay, Isabel!
Tu nombre me sabe a canto
Tu baile como a clavel

Isabel, Isabel, Isabel
Tu nombre me sabe a canto
Tu baile como a clavel

Esto si que no es un sueño
Adiós princesa de España
Adiós mi reina Isabel

Ojala que seas dichosa
Ojala te vuelva a ver
Aquí en México te admiran
Y eso que no te han mirado
Todo el arte que tu tienes
Pues nos tienes olvidados
Porque diantres nunca vienes
A mis treinta y dos estados
Mientras vienes dale un beso
A tu madre doña Ana
Dos abrazos a bernardo
Y tres a tu hermano juan
Pero cuatro a mi compadre
Agustín, el buen galán
Cinco al guapo de francisco
Que ya un hombre debe ser
Seis besitos a la niña
Esa niña que al nacer
Su papa que esta en la gloria
Le llamo niña Isabel

Isabel, Isabel, Isabel ay, ay!
Tu nombre me sabe a canto
Tu baile como a clavel

Isabel, Isabel, Isabel, Isabel ay, ay!
Tu nombre me sabe a canto
Tu baile como a clavel

Y a través de ella te canta
Y te baila sevillanas
Para que nunca estés sola
Para que nunca estés triste
Para que nunca pienses
Que la eternidad no existe

Eres como el mar de grande
Eres como el pan de buen
Eres como el sol brillante
Igual que la luna llena

Eres un sueño oh, oh!
Eres un sueño oh, oh!
Eres un sueño oh, oh!
Eres un sueño",La  Princesa y La Reina
Juan Gabriel,"Te voy a enseñar, que el amor, no es para jugar, es para querer 
No juegues conmigo, yo te quiero mucho, no te lo imaginas 
En fin, en fin, solo dame un poco de tiempo 
Y en cualquier momento lo demostrare 
Uno, dos y tres, y me das solo un beso
Te vas corriendo y yo no se porque 
Uno, dos y tres, y me das otro beso 
Me da pena este amor en juego 
Yo no se si tú, me amas en serio, más te advierto que yo no juego 
Porque en el amor, nunca hay que jugar
Solo aprender, a saber amar
Porque es tan divino, tan humano y bello 
Que se da con el alma, y pasión, y pasión 
También, es tormento, muchos sufrimientos, pero es amor

Con mi guitarra 
Y empiezo a cantar 

Es así como hago canciones 
Que luego te canto 
Y te hacen llorar, si

No es febrero ni es día de los novios, ni de enamorados como tú y yo!

Y tu siempre serás cada año un regalo, divino, de amor!

Y cuando, cuando ya estés muy cansada
Que ya no tengas nada, vas a querer volver a mí

Juan Gabriel,"Sentí tristeza al comprender, que no fue un sueño 
Que fue verdad, tú te habías ido para siempre 
Me despertó, la realidad, y fue la muerte 
De mi alegría y mi ilusión de no perderte 

Con que razón, sentí el cansancio de tus besos
Te pregunte, si todavía, me querías 
Y con silencio, contestabas mi pregunta 
Si es tan divina la verdad, porque mentías 

Yo hice todo lo posible porque un día
Tú me quisieras como yo necesitaba
Al fin y al cabo que mi amor ya lo tenías 
Yo con un poco, de tu amor me conformaba 
Y no me diste ni tu adiós cuando te fuiste 

Y todavía, yo pensaba que era un sueño 
Me despertó la realidad y fue mi muerte 
Tu ausencia fue, de mi vivir mi cruel veneno

Y mirando para el cielo 
A Dios le pide su muerte 
Que así no quiere vivir

En llorar, en llorar, en llorar 
Desde que te fuiste 
Se le fue el palomo en puro llorar

Por llorar, por llorar, por llorar 
Ya no puede ver, ni puede volar 
Se acerca su muerte está agonizando de tanto esperar

Morirá, morirá, morirá 
Morirá el palomo porque así 
Es la muerte cuando hay soledad

Mirará hacía el cielo, y te vera volando 
Te dará las gracias por esos recuerdos 
Y al cruzar las alas que te cobijaron 
Ahogará en sus sueños que no despertaron

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Juan Garcia Meledes,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

Juan Luis Guerra,"Nunca dejes de sonar mi tambora
Archipiélago de toque escondido
Eres trueno de una muerte sonora
Muerte de madera y chivo

Nunca dejes de sonar mi tambora
Crisantemos despeinados te adornan
Y la güira se ha postrado en tu cama
Y te roza

Suena un ángel, viste de tambora
Tierra adentro con la tumbadora
Mil luceros forman tu corona
Nunca muere, ey, mi tambora

Nunca dejes de sonar mi tambora
Tu cintura, aroma de aserradero
Y derrama de otras manos tu sangre
Ve pariendo un tamborero

Por allá por el estado de Zulia
En la parte norte de Venezuela
Le nacieron alas a mi tambora
Y ahora vuela

Por los Andes, sueña mi tambora

Recorro el mar de tu cuerpo

Y que importa si al final lo ocupas todo
Y me entrego a tu siniente
Y te entregas como siempre

De tu boca, dame mas que se me agota
Tu recuerdo el ultimo intento 
De vivir en un solo cuerpo,
De tu boca donde mira mi ternura
Donde apago el sol de mi hoguera
Y en la sombra,un beso me quema

Y que importa que
La noche vista oscuras
Si tu rostro en vez de luna
Mi cuarto, igual te alimenta.

Y que importa que
La brisa se desnude
Si tu amor sopla de golpe 
Y me arrastra en una nube

Y que importa si al final lo ocupas todo
Y me entrego a tu simiente
Y te entregas como siempre

De tu boca donde mira mi ternura

Juan Luis Guerra,"Elena decidió
Vender su cuerpo en una noche fría
(Ay, sí, sí, oh)
Ninguna mente dio
Y así fue hecha mujer, quién lo diría?

Ella hizo del amor
El tiempo que se pierde cada día
Más tarde se cansó
Elena decidió vender su vida, oh

Elena se fugó
Vía Caracas a Nueva York
En un furgón de un barco que salía, uh
Elena lo logró
Ahora vive en el Bronx
Con un judío de una factoría, oh!

Elena, Elena
Si te va bien escribe, Elena

Ella se la buscó
En medio de la calle, en oficina
Elena recorrió
Todo Manhattan con su pie de arcilla

Su mente ella olvidó
Sus ojos dejaba en cualquier vitrina
Allá en la ciento dos
Elena consiguió lo que quería

Nunca se imaginó
Que aquí en los Nuevas Yorks
Por entregar un sobre pagarían, uh
Tampoco imaginó
Por qué tanto temor
Ella nunca oyó hablar de cocaína, oh!

Elena, Elena
Si te va bien escribe, Elena (uh, uh, Elena)

Uh, Elena!

Y Elena así empezó
Un juego del que nunca se saldría
Ninguna mente dio
Pues su televisor se compraría, uh

Un paño se amarró
Dejó el pudor tirado en una silla
Mas nunca imaginó
Que a casa ya jamás regresaría

Y un día de calor
En la ciudad de Nueva York
Fue asesinada Elena en un tranvía, oh
El cielo se nubló
Y nadie recogió
El sobre que en su pecho ella traía, oh!

Te estuve buscando

Me detuve en el silencio
Exiliado de tus besos

Ayer
Mi sombra no se encendió
De tu querer, no, no, no
No hubo concierto del cario aquel
Y no pude atar mi cuerpo
A la geografía de tu piel

No no no!

Ayer
Mis lágrimas se pasearon
Tras de ti
Como corriente que fluye del mar
Me enredé bajo la luna
Reflejando su cintura

Ayer
Me acompañaba un café romántico, oh, no, no, no
Cerré la noche y me entregué a soñar
Y rodé sobre tus piernas
Cuesta abajo hasta la tregua

Mujer
Vísteme de infinito el corazón
Húndete lentamente, amor
Ser tuyo en un momento mágico
Mánchame de rojo con tus labios
Jubílame el temor de amarte
Y de paso lléname el vaco que hay de ti

Te estuve buscando y no te pude ver, no, no, 
Detalles que no logro comprender

Y yo vivo para ti, mujer

Que nunca pueden separarse

A escucharte con ojos
Cambiar mis sentidos
Y hacerlo a tu antojo, yo

Cura de mis labios tu risa
Me abres hasta el cielo y llovizna, tú ves

Y no te pude ver
Quiero oxigenar mi alma
Para respirar nostalgias de ti

Te fui buscando ayer

No me desesperes

Chévere, chévere

Suéltame ese amor, mamita

Y no pude atar tu cuerpo entre la gente
Y no te

Y bailan en mi cabeza
Lucecitas de colores
Porque yo tengo una alergia
A tus besitos de amores

Ay, es que eso le da a cualquiera
El beso de la ciguatera
Una condena que llevo
Por comer pescado de arena
Se me aflojan los huesitos
De los pies a la cabeza
No hay antídoto en la tierra
Ni en medio de las estrellas
Ni un tesecito que cure
El beso e la ciguatera

Pero eso le da a cualquiera
El beso e la ciguatera
Psicoanaliza mi pena
Como freudiana, morena
Un meneadito que heredo
De alguna tribu e Nigeria
No hay antídoto en la tierra
Ni en medio de las estrellas
Ni un tesecito que cure
El beso e la ciguatera

Oh, ey
Cuándo pasará, no sé
Qué le voy a hacer (cora, cora, coro, coré)
Quiero que tú me, coquito, quiero
Para yo quererte

Quiero que tú me, coquito, quiero
Para yo querete

Could I count in a week
Since that Monday
I found you were gone?

How many tears
Should I drop without healing
The sadness that I carry on?

Just listen to my heart
I don't want to stop
My heart
Burning with your touch
My heart
Beating with your love
Harder than I ever thought.

Look through my eyes
I will open your dreams
Like the wind
Gently opens the door.

Could be July 19th

Without you no more.

Cuando menos lo pensaba
Caí redondo, como una guanábana, sobre la alcantarilla
Será la presión o me ha subido la bilirrubina

Y me entró la calentura
Y me fui poniendo blanco como bola de naftalina
Me llevaron a un hospital de gente (supuestamente)
En la Emergencia, el recepcionista escuchaba la lotería
(treinta mil pesos!)

Alguien se apiade de mi!
Grité perdiendo el sentido
Y una enfermera se acercó a mi oreja y me dijo
""Tranquilo, Bobby, tranquilo""

Me acarició con sus manos de Ben Gay y me dijo
""Qué le pasa, atleta?""
Y le conté con lujo de detalles lo que me había sucedido

Hay que chequearte la presión
Pero la sala está ocupada y, mi querido
En este hospital no hay luz para un electrocardiograma

Abrí los ojos como luna llena y me agarré la cabeza
Porque es muy duro
Pasar el Niágara en bicicleta

No me digan que los médicos se fueron
No me digan que no tienen anestesia
No me digan que el alcohol se lo bebieron
Y que el hilo de coser
Fue bordado en un mantel

No me digan que las pinzas se perdieron
Que el estetoscopio está de fiesta
Que los rayos X se fundieron
Y que el suero ya se usó
Para endulzar el café

Me apoyé de sus hombros como un cojo a su muleta
Y le dije ""Qué hago, princesa?""
Y en un papel de receta me escribió muy dulcemente
(mi princesa, qué va a ser de mí?, uh)
""Lo siento, atleta""

Me acarició con sus manos de Ben Gay y siguió su destino
Y oí claramente cuando dijo a otro paciente
""Tranquilo, Bobby, tranquilo""

No me digan que no tienen anestesia

Cambian de color

de amor hablaron y no se han ido,
dile que la quiero y que la extraño, 
que no he olvidado y 
que he sufrido

Ya lo se 
cuento mi error, 
pero entiendo que el amor
todo lo perdona y nunca se acaba, corazón,
ya lo ves nada es igual 
todo es vano si no estas
Palomita blanca, 
llévale en tus alas mi canción

Dile que las noches no han callado, 
de amor hablaron y no se han ido,
dile que la quiero y que la extraño, 
que no he olvidado y 
que he sufrido

Y una gaviota de luz 
entre las olas del mar,
va recogiendo el azul que yo no te supe dar
y una aurora con besos de tu

Dile que las noches no han callado, 
de amor hablaron y no se han ido,

Quisiera que me hablaras cuando callas, 
O al menos ser el nudo en tu garganta, 
Quisiera ser la silla que te aguanta, 
Tu zafacon de besos escondidos, 
Y prender el alba y amasar la noche, 
Y salir contigo, disfrazado de horizonte, 

Quisiera, y tantas cosas mas quisiera.
Quisiera, y tantas cosas mas quisiera.

Quisiera ser el asa de tus ojos, 
El calcio que te dan tus vitaminas, 
Tu ruta cuando cruzas la neblina,
Y el cordón umbilical de tu zapato.
Y contar contigo y doblar las calles
Y sembrar guayabas
Y abonar con tus detalles.

No necesito decirte dos mil quinientos veces
Multiplicado por siete
Que te espero noche y día

Que me disculpen los sabios
Pero la sabiduría
Duerme detrás de tu oreja
Y no en Grecia
Como la historia creía

Cómo te puedo querer eternamente
Cúrame la sombra al caminar
Que se corre si no estás

No necesito violines
Pizzicatos en el pecho
Eres todo mi concierto
La más bella sinfonía

Que me disculpe el poeta
Pero toda la poesía
La encuentro sobre un madero
Y me verso con tus rodillas que riman

Se quedo bajo mi cama

Como tinta indeleble
Como mancha de acero.
No se olvida el idioma
Cuando dos hacen amor.

Como el sol en la tarde.
Se desgarra mi cuerpo
Y no vivo un segundo
Para decirte que sin ti muero.

Me quedé en tus pupilas mi bien
Ya no cierro los ojos.
Me tiré a los mas hondo
Y me ahogo en los mares
De tu partida, de tu partida.

Andaré sin saberlo
Calzaré de tu cuerpo
Como huellas en hierro
Comeré lo que sobre
Dentro de tu corazón.

Y seré un mar desierto
Una frase silente
La elegida de un beso
Un planeta de celos
Esculpiendo una canción.

Forjado de recuerdos
Y sin saber es cielo en la ventana
Que me abre la mañana

Tu amor me parte en dos el occidente
Me clava de repente
Y me convierte en masa que se amolda
A una ilusión ardiente

Dime si mastico el verde menta de tu voz
O le pego un parcho al alma
Átame al pulgar derecho de tu corazón
Y dime como está mi amor en tu amor

Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calla
Y se enciende si es que acaso le quieres

Tu amor despierta y lava su carita
De rosas me salpica
Y sin saber es una vía láctea
Que gira y me da vida

Tu amor lo guardo dentro de mis ojos
Como una lagrimita
Y no los lloro para que no salgan
Tus besos de mi vista

Pudiera ser un farolito
Y encender tu luz (para encender mi luz)
Hasta que quieras tú

Un grito de guerra

Soy un soldado, oh.

Soy soldado del padre y del hijo
Muy bien armado
Soy soldado de su santo espíritu
Y protegido
Soy soldado de voz y trompeta
Oh, oh
Aleluya, soldado de guerra
Ya lo ves

Soy soldado del padre y del hijo
Soy un soldado
Soy soldado de su santo espíritu
Y tú eres soldado
Soy soldado de voz y trompeta

Juan Luis Guerra,"Voy abriendo caminos para dejarte
Las cosas buenas que aprendo
Mientras camino mis calles

Me llevare
Las buenas luces que tiene la gente
Que me iluminan la vida
Y me regalan mi suerte

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar
Quiero ver la risa del sol por las mañanas
Que venga siempre a golpearnos la ventana
Yo quiero un sol
Yo quiero un sol que me acompañe
Hablando siempre de frente
Tirando todo lo malo

Voy abriendo caminos para encontrarte
En este mundo perdido
También hay buenos amigos.

Y me llevare
Las buenas luces que tiene la gente
Y cuando me sienta solo
Me cuidaran para siempre

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar

Quiero ver la risa del sol por las mañanas
Que venga siempre a golpearnos la ventana
Yo quiero un sol
Yo quiero un sol que siempre me acompañe
Hablando siempre de frente
Tirando todo lo malo.

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar
Saca el dolor afuera
Y no te quedes a esperar
Como un rió que camina hacia el mar
Ríe, llora
Que aun queda mucho por andar

Y aunque en el mundo hay personas tan grises
Hay otras que no paran de brillar
En esta vida que se me termina
No quiero ya dejarte de cantar

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar
Saca el dolor afuera
Y no te quedes a esperar
Como un rió que camina hacia el mar
Ríe, llora
Que aun queda mucho por andar

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar

Ojala que llueva café en el campo

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar

Saber que se puede, querer que se pueda
Sacarlo todo pa fuera

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar

Cuando tu cantas conmigo Juan Luis
Ahí me sube la bilirrubina a mi

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar
Pero deja Diego que tus sueños
Sean olas que vienen y van

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar

Quisiera ser un pez
Y no perderme en este mar

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar

Y a pesar de los errores
Tratar de estar mejor

Como un rió que camina hacia el mar",Abriendo Caminos
Juan Luis Guerra,"Dime si me vas a querer
Soy hombre de poco hablar, Consuelo
No tengo nada que ofrecer
Un conuco, un gallo y un lucero

Y la luz de la mañana
Que entra por mi ventana, cielo
Y los ríos y la montaña
Y el viento que peina tu pelo
Yo quisiera ofrecerte el mundo y no puedo

No me tienes que ofrecer
Tu mirada es lo único que quiero
Dormiremos cuando el día
Se acueste encima del potrero

Y los grillos harán su canto
Entre yerba y pasto soñaremos
Y de tanto amor tu cuerpo
Hará de mi vientre lo que espero
Un retrato de tu cariño, te quiero",Amore de Conuco [Pop Version]
Juan Luis Guerra,"Bendito el lugar, y el motivo de estar ahí
Bendita la coincidencia
Bendito el reloj, q nos puso puntual ahí
Bendita sea tu, presencia

Bendito Dios por encontrarnos, en el camino
Y de quitarme esta soledad, de mi destino

Bendita la luz, bendita la luz de tu mirada
Bendita la luz, bendita la luz de tu mirada
Desde el alma

Bendito ojos, que me esquivaban
Simulaban desde que me ignoraban
Y de repente, sostienes la mirada

Bendita Dios por encontrarnos, en el camino
Y de quitarme esta soledad, de mi destino

Bendita la luz, bendita la luz de tu mirada
Bendita la luz, bendita la luz de tu mirada, oh

Gloria divina, diste suerte de buen tino
Y de encontrarte justo ahí, en medio del camino
Gloria al cielo de encontrarte ahora
Llevarte mi soledad, y coincidir en mi destino
En el mismo destino

Bendita la luz, bendita la luz de tu mirada
Bendita la luz, bendita la luz de tu mirada
Bendita mirada
Bendita mirada desde el alma, tu mirada
Bendita, bendita, bendita mirada
Bendita tu alma y bendita tu luz

Y un atardecer pintó de canvas el cielo
Caminé la playa de Momochi, mi anhelo
Y se me escapó una sonrisa del alma
Aquí me enseñó arigatou gozaimasu

Paga impuesto en el oído

Y hace pum si te ve

Hoy te confieso amor
Lo digo para mi para mi
Si Nueva York tiene
El puente de Brooklyn
Yo te tengo a ti

Vivo soñando, buscando
Como agradarte mujer
Eres la flor del naranjo
Donde yo encuentro la miel

Para que sepas tu
Yo vivo pensando en ti
Y si París tiene el Arco de Triunfo
Yo te tengo a ti
Ma de thi chacha gui gui

Si París tiene el arco de triunfo
Y adoney en el orangeri
Y Nueva York tiene el puente
De Brooklyn yo te tengo a ti

Vivo soñando, buscando
Como agradarte mujer
Eres la flor del naranjo
Donde yo encuentro la miel

Para que sepas tu
Yo, vivo pensando en ti
Para que sepas tu
Mi corazón suspira
Y hace pum si te vas

Hoy te confieso amor
Lo digo para mi para mi
Que reserve la mañana
En santiago y la noche en Madrid

Y hoy reserve la mañana
En santiago y la noche en Madrid",Para Que Sepas
Juan Luis Guerra,"Tú me preguntas como nace el horizonte?
Como cabalga un pensamiento por el rió?
Cual es el vientre que dio a luz al polo norte?
Temblando de frió
Como se ordeña la mañana en primavera?
Como se afinan los bemoles del Rocio?
Y entre preguntas y preguntas nos llego la tarde
Y esta respuesta te di

Todo pasa, la ciruela pasa
El fruto la rama y la mata
Todo pasa, el pobre y el rico
Por mas que te afanes te digo
Todo pasa, la harina y la masa
El pan cotidiano de casa
Todo pasa, todo pasa, todo pasa

Cuál es el tono de una hormiga enamorada?
Cómo se peinan los cabellos de los lirios?
Quién pinta el labio de la luna
Cuándo esta de fiesta bailando contigo?
Cuál es el diccionario de las aceitunas?
Cómo se nace por segunda vez cariño?
Y entre preguntas y preguntas al llegar la noche
Está respuesta te di

Todo pasa, la ciruela pasa
La uva, la rama y la mata
Todo pasa, el pobre y el rico
Con todos sus panes, te digo
Todo pasa, la harina y la masa
El pan cotidiano de casa
Todo pasa, todo pasa, todo pasa

El viento del mar y las nubes de sal y de plata
El tiempo que va circulando en un viejo reloj
La cuna que duerme el silencio
El oro con su resplandor
El sueño del hielo, la escracha, la osa mayor
Yo te digo

Todo pasa, la ciruela pasa
El fruto la rama y la mata
Todo pasa, el pobre y el rico
Por mas que te afanes te digo
Todo pasa, la harina y la masa
El pan cotidiano de casa
Todo pasa, todo pasa, todo pasa

Lo único que nunca pasa es el amor
Lo único que nunca pasa es el amor

Aunque se muevan los mares
Y se tambaleen los rios
Y la tierra se quebrante bajo el sol
Lo único que nunca pasa es el amor
Lo único que nunca pasa es el amor

Aunque pasen las montañas
Y se muden los caminos
Nadie podra separarme de mi Dios
Lo unico que nunca pasa es el amor
Lo unico que nunca pasa es el amor

Lo unico que nunca pasa es el amor
Yo te digo
Lo unico que nunca pasa es el amor",Todo Pasa
Juan Luis Guerra,"Tú me dices que tu corazón
Ha sufrido tanto que
No le queda la ilusión, para amar otra vez
Que has llorado sin consuelo
Que no encuentras la razón
Pero yo te digo lo viejo pasó, cariño
Lo que viene es mucho mejor
Tú no sabes que la luna no se queda sola
Se alegra en un mar de olas
Y le dice a la amapola
Que espera su cariñito
Como la güira espera tambora
Que todo tiene su hora
Debajo del sol naciente
Espera tu amor bendito de nada vale ser impaciente
Ay no ay no
Me preguntas cómo yo lo sé
Que te de una explicación
Pero con el buen amor
Solo hay, que creer
Pon tu cara de alegría
Vístete con mi canción
Y recuerda siempre lo viejo pasó, cariño
Lo que viene es mucho mejor
Tú no sabes que la luna no se queda sola
Se alegra en un mar de olas
Y le dice a la amapola
Que espera su cariñito
Como la güira espera tambora
Que todo tiene su hora
Debajo del sol naciente
Espera tu amor bendito de nada vale ser impaciente
El mar rodeado de estrellas
El canto de las palmeras
La risa del horizonte y la lluvia todos son para ti
El rojo de las cayenas y el cielo de nubes bellas fueron hechos para ti
Son para ti

Se alegra en un mar de olas
Y le dice a la amapola que espera su cariñito
Como la güira espera tambora
Como tambora
Que todo tiene su hora
Tu ve'
Debajo del sol naciente
Espera tu amor bendito de nada vale ser impaciente
Ay no
Se alegra en un mar de olas
Y le dice a la amapola
Que espera su cariñito
Como la güira espera tambora
Que todo tiene su hora
Tu ve'
Debajo del sol naciente
Ya viene tu amor bendito de nada vale ser impaciente
Ay no
Se alegra en un mar de olas
Y le dice a la amapola
Que espera su cariñito
Como la güira espera tambora
Que todo tiene su hora, debajo del sol naciente
Ya viene tu amor bendito de nada vale ser impaciente ay no
Si es un regalo del Señor
Ser impaciente ay no
Si es un regalo del Señor",Todo Tiene Su Hora

A ti te canto, solo a ti (Gua, guarara)

Amor intenso, más ancho que el mar

Tus besos se han quedado en mi cara mujer
Son como sellitos de amor en mi piel

Tus besos se han quedado en mi cara mujer
Son como sellitos de amor en mi piel
Tus besos procurándome en esta canción
Viven en la esquina de mi corazón

Tus besos me arrullan, me colman de bien
Besos de ternura, besitos de miel
Tus besos me enamoran, me dan la ilusión

Juan Luis Juancho,"Sabor ese movimiento, este Juancho tomando el control
Quiero que abran paso que vengo dando mucho temor
Mueve la cintura, pecho con pecho que así es mejor
Ahora quiero que se sigan meneando
Así coge tu pareja merengue urbano lo traigo aquí
Ritmo tropical es mi repertorio y es para ti
Para provocar a los reporteros que hablan de mi
Y después que todos sigan meneando
Menéalo un poquito, menéalo suavecito
Menéalo un poquito, (te quiero ver) menéalo suavecito

Fácil, como el reggaetón
Que tus alumnos puede ser frágil
Hay que sacudir ese polvorín de una forma ágil
A la policía decirle que terminamos casi
Pero en realidad tu sigues meneando, el cuerpo
De manera que todos en el party se pongan sueltos
No te metas que en el merengue urbano Juancho es experto
Y si no me crees pregunta a Torillo porque esto es cierto
Mi merengue es calle sigan meneando

Menéalo un poquito, menéalo suavecito
Menéalo un poquito, (te quiero ver) menéalo suavecito
Menéalo un poquito, (te quiero ver)

Y dale bailalo, muevelo, gozalo, sientelo
No te quedes sin trabajar mami dale agítalo
Porque te tengo un ritmo violento
Que te pone a bailar a sudar y a vivir el momento

Y dale bailalo, muevelo, gozalo, sientelo
No te quedes sin trabajar mami dale agítalo
Porque te tengo un ritmo violento
Que te pone a bailar a sudar y a vivir el momento

Así que sacude, no lo pienses mas, no lo dudes
Te traigo el mambo que te lleva a las nubes
Nena esto es pa' que te cures
De viernes a sábado, domingo al lunes
Reprende conmigo, nos vamos activando
El dj matando, mi canción sonando
Ya nos consideran los reyes del mambo
Y por un escenario, Juancho matando
Con las manos en la cintura sigan meneando, aja
Empujando pecho con pecho sigan meneando, aja aja
Vacilando lo mas que puedan sigan meneando, aja
Con la nota que tienen todos griten el coro que dice así

Menéalo un poquito, menéalo suavecito
Menéalo un poquito, (te quiero ver) menéalo suavecito

Juan Magán,"Buenas noches amigas, se ven un tanto perdidas
Solas y modo emotiva, repasando tu vida
Y solo encuentras un motivo firme para continuar

Que fueron 5 años de vida, si una noche a escondidas
Que logro cambiar tu vida, cuando estabas sin salida
Y ahora no encuentras la manera de volver atrás

Ella va y viene como el viento
Solo disfruta del momento
Como si se parara el tiempo
Y ya no se quiere enamorar

Ella va y viene como el viento (ella va y viene)
Solo disfruta del momento (del momento)
Como si se parara el tiempo
Y ya no se quiere enamorar

Ya paso la tormenta
Se canso de la rutina
Ya no quiere más dramas
Cero atrasos en su vida

Solo existen noches de baile
Cuando danzas pierdo el aire

Sube la mano arriba
Y mueve la cintura
Date media vuelta
Y ponle sabrosura

Ay menea pa aquí, menea pa allá
Y vamos a bailar

Ella va y viene como el viento
Solo disfruta del momento
Como si se parara el tiempo
Y ya no se quiere enamorar

Ella va y viene como el viento (ella va y viene)
Solo disfruta del momento (del momento)
Como si se parara el tiempo
Y ya no se quiere enamorar

Sube la mano arriba
Y mueve la cintura
Date media vuelta
Y ponle sabrosura

Ay menea pa aquí, menea pa allá
Y vamos a bailar

Ella va y viene como el viento
Solo disfruta del momento
Como si se parara el tiempo
Y ya no se quiere enamorar

Ella va y viene como el viento
Solo disfruta del momento
Como si se parara el tiempo
Y ya no se quiere enamorar",Como El Viento

Juan Magán,"Hoy me he dado cuenta que he perdido el tiempo
Pensando en conseguir más de lo que ya tengo
Sin valorar lo que la vida ya me daba a tu lado
Y ahora que te tengo tan lejos reconozco los días

He llorado, como un niño
Que no ve la luz del sol cuando es verano
Y le han quitado, de sus manos
Su mejor sonrisa el tiempo más preciado

Y no me he cansado de soñarte a mi lado
De pensar que al día de hoy me has olvidado
Yo te amo, yo te amo, yo te amo

Y aunque dí la vuelta al mundo no conozco una frontera
Que los corazones rompan dos, no hay patria ni bandera
Más bonita que la brisa que se dibuja en tu cara
Soy pirata navegando en los mares de tu mirada

No quiero dejar de pensar en ti
No puedo dejar de soñar contigo
Dime qué hago si no estás aquí
Te necesito como el aire que respiro

He llorado, como un niño
Que no ve la luz del sol cuando es verano
Y le han quitado, de sus manos
Su mejor sonrisa el tiempo más preciado

Y no me he cansado de soñarte a mi lado
De pensar que al día de hoy me has olvidado
Yo te amo, yo te amo, yo te amo

Sin valorarte, de nada vale tenerte cerca o lejos
No me quejo, solo quiero hacerme viejo, a tu lado

He llorado, como un niño
Que no ve la luz del sol cuando es verano
Y le han quitado, de sus manos
Su mejor sonrisa el tiempo más preciado

No me he cansado de soñarte a mi lado
De pensar que al día de hoy me has olvidado
Yo te amo, yo te amo, yo te amo",He Llorado (Como Un Niño)
Juan Magán,"Tengo la sensación de que non vuelves nunca
Tengo en mi mente grabado el momento
¿Por qué te fuiste si aún me estás sintiendo?

Te pido vuelve
Que tú no Sabes lo que estoy sufriendo
Ya no me importa parar más el tiempo
Si al despertar te encuentro aquí a mi lado

Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life

Yo creo que me mataste
Desde que te fuiste
Porque no siento el corazón
Y todo lo veo triste
Que me tranquilicen,
Que me psicoanalicen
Que me hagan lo que sea
Mientras tú vengas y regreses

Te espero en la casa
La puerta está abierta
Y Siempre lo ha estado
Por si tú regresas
Ven dame la vida
Un beso me basta
Para recuperar todo lo que
Me hace falta
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life

Intento continuar mi vida
Pero mire donde mire
Veo tu retrato
Ok, y para que decir mentiras
Sabes que yo para amarte
Siempre fui un novato

Solo me quedan huellas de tu
Bye, bye, bye
Mientras nuestra historia ya
Es historia
Si supieras que me ahoga
Tanta libertad
My life is over (Magan)

Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life
Bring me back your life

Ok, regresa papi
Calma este tsunami
Que arrasa en todo mi interior
Sin ti no hay nada de mí
No Music, no life
No hay nada por lo que ser yo
(Juan Magan) tengo la sensación de que no
Vuelves nunca
Tengo en mi mente grabado el momento
¿Por qué te fuiste si aún me estás sintiendo?

Te pido Vuelve que tú no
Sabes lo que estoy sufriendo
Ya no me importa parar más

Si al despertar te encuentro

Juan Magán,"Todos mis amigos piden que te olvide ya 
No saben ni lo que dicen 
No te olvidaré jamás

Me recuerda los tiempos soñandote junto a mí

Que te olvidaste de mí

Dejo que me desanime

Cada vez que huelo yo tu perfume aquí 
Me recuerda los tiempos soñándote junto a mí

Juan Mendoza,"Si arrastré por estemundo
la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

¡Si aquella boca mentía
el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Y puedes ver que estoy feliz por ti 
Y tu lo estas por mi

Que lo que nos paso 
No pudo ser mejor 
Que el tiempo ya paso 
Y que entre tu y yo

Ya nunca habrá nada personal

Son tan lejanos los recuerdos 
Si te asomas y miras atrás 
Nos regalamos los días soñados 
Y eso nunca lo voy a olvidar

Juan Ramon,"Esa que pasó mi Leo oiga
Qué hacemos con Celia
Napo ponle un reggaetón

La conocí un domingo
Hablamos de pasear
Le pregunte su nombre
Y muchas cosas mas

El lunes fue un fracaso
No vino ya lo se
Porque al otro domingo
De nuevo la encontré

Así comienza nuestro
Amor en primavera
Cuando las rosas
Del rosal son como Celia

Ahora solo me pregunto
Quizás me quiera
Y no hago mas
Que repetir tu nombre Celia

Entramos juntos
A la iglesia por vez primera
Para que Dios desde
El altar nos bendijera

Ahora el tiempo nos dirá
Que yo con Celia
No nos separaremos mas
Que Dios lo quiera

Every go that swa every subelo
Sabes que rápidamente
Cantando escucha mi dembo

Con el leo leo
Metiendo perre reo
Con todas las yales yales
En el bailoteo Teo

Que paso mama
What this caíd mama
His tab does tab se quedo mama
Con el leo dan hállale

Que yo con Celia
No nos separaremos mas

Algo tan, tan especial y el teléfono no para de sonar, yo sigo 
Siendo tan especial. pasan los días y comienzo a notar
Cierto mal humor, me empiezan a contestar mal
Necesito las cosas que te presté
Creo que hoy no vamos a poder

Al compás de la vihuela,
Que al hombre que lo desvela

Con el cantar se consuela

No le des de qué quejarse
Y cuando quiera enojarse
Vos te tenes que encoger
Pues siempre es bueno tener
Palenque ande ir a rascarse.

A nadies tengas envidia
Es muy triste el envidiar
Cuando veas a otro ganar
A estorbarlo no te metas

Por encontrarlo oportuno, 
No es para mal de ninguno,
Sino para bien de todos",Martín Fierro

El sol parece
Una bola roja, que a veces
Me moja con calor

Por la ventana
Veo cómo asfaltan

Pienso en lo bueno que era todo esto
En mi abuela que cortaba el pasto afuera
Nos cruzábamos enfrente
Es deprimente

Cómo un vecino
Con tan mal tino
Arengó a la gente
E hizo que reviente este lugar

Ahora los camiones pasan
Son montones

Porque me lamento con dolor

El camino no hay un trino
El cemento Duhaldino

Hay que tenerlo controlado por un día o dos
Escondido, atormentado por esa herida
La soberbia lo mantiene en su guarida

!Pero hay que ver que pasa
Con esa herida que le sangra!
A la fuerza, con un envión
A que salga hay que intimar al felón

Su familia ruega un favor
Que se rinda, se arrepienta y pida perdón
Que salga así herido, cansado, dolido, apenado

Y queda olvidado, olvidado el mal

Todos los días afuera
No quiero ver que tus balas
Toquen mi piel con su hoguera
Hoy se derrumba mi razón
Hoy no tendrás mi bendición
Hoy se termina la prisión
Hoy tocará la luz

Tu amor es frió
Como la sangre de tu mente muerta
Queriendo volverse fuego
Tu amor es frió
Como la escarcha que cubre tu esencia
Queriendo volverse agua.

Cierro los ojos y el alma
Para no ser vulnerable
Para no hundirme en la inmensa prolongación del engaño
Hoy se derrumba mi razón
Hoy no tendrás mi bendición
Hoy se termina la prisión
Hoy tocará la luz

Tu amor es frió
Como la sangre de tu mente muerta
Queriendo volverse fuego
Tu amor es frió
Como la escarcha que cubre tu esencia
Queriendo volverse agua.
Tu amor es frió.
Tu amor es frió.",Vulnerable

Y veo que a mi lado estás y me siento renovado
Me siento aniquilado aniquilado si no estás
Tu controlas toda mi verdad y todo lo que está de más
Tus ojos me llevan lentamente al sol
Y tu boca me habla del amor y el corazón
Tu piel tiene el color de un rojo atardecer

Y es por ti
Que late mi corazón
Y es por ti
Que brillan mis ojos hoy
Y es por ti
Que he vuelto a hablar de amor
Y es por ti
Que calma mi dolor
Y cada vez que yo te busco
Y no te puedo aún hallar

Me siento un vagabundo
Perdido por el mundo
Desordenado si no estás
Como mueves tú mi felicidad

Que tu ausencia me devora entero el corazón

Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver
Y en las estrellas tus ojos ver
Cuando tus fotos me siento a ver

Cada vez que te busco te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo no estas
Es por eso que debo decir
Que tu solo en mis fotos estas

Cada vez que te busco te vas
Y cada vez que te llamo no estas
Es por eso que debo decir

Cuando hay un abismo desnudo
Que se opone entre los dos
Yo me valgo del recuerdo taciturno de tu voz
Y de nuevo siento enfermo este corazón

Juanes,"Esta es la historia de Juan El niño que nadie amó
Que por las calles creció Buscando el amor bajo el sol
Su madre lo abandonó
Su padre lo maltrató
Su casa fue un callejón
Su cama un cartón su amigo Dios
Juan preguntó por amor
Y el mundo se lo negó
Juan preguntó por honor
Y el mundo le dió deshonor
Juan preguntó por perdón
Y el mundo lo lastimó
Juan preguntó y preguntó Y el mundo jamás lo escuchó

El sólo quizo jugar El sólo quizo soñar El sólo quizo amar
Pero el mundo lo olvidó
El sólo quizo volar El sólo quizo cantar El sólo quizo amar
Pero el mundo lo olvidó

Tan fuerte fue su dolor Que un día se lo llevó
Tan fuerte fue su dolor Que su corazón se apagó
Tan fuerte fue su temor Que un día solo lloró
Tan fuerte fue su temor Que un día su luz se apagó

Un malpa la violó y ella se vengó 

Y confundió el amor fue una bala lo que entró en su corazón 
Nunca jamás lloró y en su alma siempre un llanto se escuchó 
De tantos que mató uno vino mal herido y se vengó 
Rosario así murió y en el cementerio nadie la lloró",Rosario Tijeras
Juanes,"Duérmete pronto mi amor 
Que la noche ya llegó 

Y cierra tus ojos que yo 
De tus sueños cuidaré 
Siempre a tu lado estaré

Si un día te sientes mal 
Yo de bien te llenaré 

Y aunque muy lejos tú estés 
Yo a tu sombra cuidaré 
Siempre a tu lado estaré 

Y tu guardián yo seré 
Toda la vida 
Esta noche 
Te prometo que no vendrán 
Ni dragones ni fantasmas a molestar 

Y en la puerta de tus sueños yo voy a estar 
Hasta que tus ojos vuelvan a abrir

Duérmete mi amor hasta que salga el sol

Juanes,"Daría lo que fuera por volverte a ver
Daría hasta mi vida y mi fusil, mis botas y mi fe
Por eso en la trinchera de mi soledad
Tus ojos son mi luz y tu esplendor mi corazón

Y si no fuera por ti yo no podría vivir
En el vació de estos días de no saber
Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz
Como lo soy cuando con tus besos me veo partir

Y es que solo con saber que al regresar tu esperaras por mi
Aumentan los latidos de mi corazón

Volverte a ver es todo lo que quiero hacer
Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raíz
Ni una razón para vivir

Lo único que quiero es poder regresar
Poder todas las balas esquivar y sobrevivir
Tu amor es mi esperanza y tu mi munición
Por eso regresar a ti es mi única misión

Y si no fuera por ti yo no podría vivir
En el vació de estos días de no saber
Y si no fuera por ti yo no seria feliz

Volverte a ver para poderme reponer
Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raíz

Eres todo lo que tengo
Y no me quiero morir
Sin poder otra vez

Porque sin ti mi vida yo no soy feliz
Porque sin ti mi vida no tiene raíz

Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Que tengo la camisa negra

Mal parece que solo me quedé 
Y fue pura todita tu mentira 
Que maldita mala suerte la mía 
Que aquel día te encontré 
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor 
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor 
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós 
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo… 
Tengo la camisa negra 
Porque negra tengo el alma

Juanes,"Well I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Juanes,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Juanes,"Hace mucho tiempo no me
Enamoraba de unos ojos tan bonitos
Comunes de lozano brillo
Era lo que menos en mi plan estaba
Aunque te admito que a veces soñaba
Con la belleza de tu mirada

Quiero llevar el ritmo de tu corazón
Para bailar entre los dos esta canción
La verdad, me estoy volviendo a enamorar
La verdad, quiero que sepas que

Lo que yo siento por ti, es amor
Ganas que me hacen nutrir, el corazón
Droga que me hace inmune, ante el dolor
Gotas de agua dulce, rayo de sol

Lo que yo siento por ti, es amor
Ganas que me hacen nutrir, el corazón
Droga que me hace inmune, ante el dolor
Gotas de agua dulce, rayo de sol

Llévame, de ser preciso, por la semblanza de tu sombra
Yo se que tu prendes la luz y en mi vida te asomas
Como las blancas palomas, cuando la plaza se toman
Con vuelo inmortal

Quiero llevar el ritmo de tu corazón
Para bailar entre los dos esta canción
La verdad, me estoy volviendo a enamorar
La verdad, quiero que sepas que

Lo que yo siento por ti, es amor
Ganas que me hacen nutrir, el corazón
Droga que me hace inmune, ante el dolor
Gotas de agua dulce, rayo de sol

Lo que yo siento por ti, es amor
Ganas que me hacen nutrir, el corazón
Droga que me hace inmune, ante el dolor
Gotas de agua dulce, rayo de sol

Es lo que siento por tí
Es lo que siento por tí
Es lo que siento por tí",Gotas de Agua Dulce
Juanes,"Llorarás, llorarás cuando se vaya el sol
Y yo con el dejando tu vida sola
Te dirán, te dirán las flores del jardín
Cuando te ame y cuando soñé tu luz

Devuélveme ese corazón
Que tu no supiste valorar
Lo que te daba yo de verdad

Devuélvelo, devuélvelo no es tuyo no
Ya se acabó el tiempo en que tú brillabas
Devuélveme ese corazón
Que tu no supiste valorar
Lo que en verdad te daba yo
Oh

Hoy me voy pero no, no se va la herida que me queda
Por amarte, por mi culpa
Por los besos que en el mar te di
Corazón me sobró y coraje me falto para dejarte
Tengo miedo de no olvidarte
Y por eso de ti me despido

Juanes,"Cada blanco en mi mente
Se vuelve color con verte
Y el deseo de tenerte
Es más fuerte es más fuerte

Solo quiero que me lleves
De tu mano por la senda
Y atravesar el bosque
Que divide nuestras vidas

Hay tantas cosas
Que me gustan hoy de ti

Me enamora
Que me hables con tu boca
Me enamora
Que me eleves hasta el cielo

Sin ti mi vida no tiene sentido
Sin ti mi vida es como un remolino
De cenizas que se van, oh
Volando con el viento

Yo no se si te merezco
Solo sé que aun deseo
Que le des luz a mi vida
En los días venideros

Léeme muy bien los labios
Te lo digo bien despacio
Por el resto de mis días
Quiero ser tu compañía

Hay tantas cosas

Juanes,"Dime la verdad, no me engañes más, algo pasa  
Lo noto al escuchar tu voz  
Si algo tienes que decir, antes de dormir,  
Yo estaré aquí, al otro lado  
Recuerda que ante todo soy tu mejor amigo amor  
 
Y que siempre estaré cuando quieras hablar  
En mi puedes confiar enteramente porque tu para mi
 
Eres la mejor, la mejor parte de mi  
Es que tu eres ese amor, que nunca quiero verse ir  
Porque tu eres la mejor, la mejor parte de mi  
Es que tu eres ese amor, que es la razón de mi vivir  
 
Se que no has estado bien y yo en mi soledad también lo he sentido  
Esos vacíos que nos da  
Pero nadie dijo que, era fácil esto de amarse así, sin lastimar  
Recuerda que ante todo soy, tu mejor amigo amor
 
Y que siempre estaré cuando quieras hablar  
En mi puedes confiar enteramente  
Porque tu, para mi
Eres la mejor, la mejor parte de mi  
Es que tu eres ese amor, que nunca quiero verse ir  
Porque tu eres la mejor, la mejor parte de mi  
Es que tu eres ese amor, que es la razón de mi vivir  
 
Tu dame hoy la mejor parte de mi
Tu dame hoy la mejor parte de mi",La Mejor Parte de Mí
Juanes,"Son caminos de caminos 
Donde las piedras son las minas 
Que van rompiendo huesos 
De la tierra que se queja 
Dejando invalida la esperanza 

La dulce voz de un niño 
Se torna en la tormenta 
De un llanto incontrolable 
De dolores viscerales 
Que no entiende la inocencia 

Los árboles están llorando 
Son testigos de tantos años de violencia 
El mar esta marrón, mezcla de sangre con la tierra 

Pero ahí vienen bajando de la montaña con la esperanza 
Las madres que den por sus hijos 
Y que sus libros para la escuela son su soñar 
Pero ahí vienen bajando de la montaña con la esperanza 
Hombres y niños mal heridos, buscando asilo 
Buscando un sitio, para soñar y amar 

No merecemos el olvido, somos la vos del pueblo 
Dice un señor sentado, con sus dos ojos vendados 
Pero que aún tiene la esperanza en sus manos 

Los árboles están llorando 
Son testigos de tantos años de violencia 
El mar esta marrón, mezcla de sangre con la tierra 

Pero ahí vienen bajando de la montaña con la esperanza 
Las madres que den por sus hijos 
Y que sus libros para la escuela son su soñar 
Pero ahí vienen bajando de la montaña con la esperanza 
Hombres y niños mal heridos, buscando asilo 
Buscando un sitio, para soñar y amar

Son caminos de caminos
Son caminos de caminos",Minas Piedras
Juanes,"Cuando la vida me da golpes y me manda para el suelo 
Es cuando yo más siento que tengo que levantarme 
Que dar la cara al miedo, es una forma de vencerlo 
No voy a darme por vencido, no voy a darle mi vida el miedo 
El miedo es un asesino que mata los sentimientos 
Siempre que estoy solo, es porque dios esta aquí adentro 

Y necesito silencio para poder encontrar 
Mi propia vos y mi verdad
Y al final de la oscuridad 
No me siento solo, se que estas conmigo 

Hoy voy a levantarme y no voy a resignar mi corazón 
Hacer lo que quise y no pude 
No lo voy a aceptar hoy, voy a buscar estar mejor 
La vida tiene solución, aquí no hay nada imposible 
No creo en el jamas, no!
No creo en el jamas, no!

Si darse por vencido es una forma de morir
Entonces yo jamas quiero darle el gusto a la muerte 
Pienso en mi familia, el corazón late más fuerte 
Que no se puede vivir pensando en cuando se va a morir 
Y dicen que sonar es tanto como sonar estando vivo 
Yo creo en el presente y eso me aleja de la muerte 

Y necesito silencio para encontrar
Mi propia vos y mi verdad 
Y al final de la oscuridad 
No me siento solo, se que estas conmigo 

Hoy voy a levantarme y no voy a resignar mi corazón 
Hacer lo que quise y no pude 
No lo voy a aceptar hoy, voy a buscar estar mejor 
La vida tiene solución, aquí no hay nada imposible 
No creo en el jamas, no!
No creo en el jamas, no!",No Creo en el Jamás
Juanes,"Yo no pienso que me pueda de ti olvidar
Yo no pienso que mi corazón resita un día más
Yo no soy lo que tu quieras que sea este amor
Solo soy la puerta abierta que te da mi corazón
Mi vida esta pendiente más de ti

Preguntando por ti
Caminando por ti
Esperando por ti
Navegando por ti
Volando por ti
Soñanado por ti

Cuando cuente tres otra vez, vuelve a salir
Quererte a mi, me hare feliz
Si el cielo se torna gris why el 'tino llegue a su fin
No quiero jamas sentir que de mi vida te vuelves a ir

En el oscuro de mi alma brilla la luz
Iluminando la sabana donde el cielo es azul
Por un poquito de tu boca, me muero si toca
Por un poquito de tu corazón, hago lo que sea
Hago lo que sea, mi vida esta pendiente más de ti

Preguntando por ti
Caminando por ti
Esperando por ti
Velando por ti
Navegando por ti
Volando por ti
Soñanado

Cuando cuente tres otra vez, vuelve a salir
Quererte a mi, me hare feliz
Si el cielo se torna gris why el 'tino llegue a su fin

Es la misión más grande que tenemos tu y yo
En esta vida, que aprender, entender y saber
Porque estos tiempos son difíciles y es más escasa a la verdad

Que cambie todo pero no el amor
Nuestra familia es más importante, ya lo sé
Y la debemos proteger y volver a tejer
Porque estos tiempos son difíciles y es más escasa a la verdad
Porque estos tiempos son difíciles y estamos sentados tan lejos el uno del otro
Porque estos tiempos son difíciles y estamos atados de manos y corazón

No dejemos que se nos acabe que la vida es un ratico, un ratico nada más

Juanes,"Trabajamos como dos locomotoras a todo vapor
Y olvidamos que el amor
Es mas fuerte que el dolor
Que envenena la razón

Somos victimas así de nuestra propia tonta creación
Y olvidamos que el amor
Es mas fuerte que el dolor
Que una llaga en tu interior

Los hermanos ya no se deben pelear
Es momento de recapacitar
Es tiempo de cambiar
It’s time to change
Es tiempo de cambiar
It’s time to change
Es tiempo de saber
Pedir perdón
Es tiempo de cambiar
En la mente de todos
El odio por amor

It’s time to change

Si te pones a pensar
La libertad no tiene propiedad
Quiero estar contigo amor
Quiero estar contigo amor
Quiero estar contigo amor

Si aprendemos a escuchar
Quizás podamos juntos caminar
De la mano hasta el final
Yo aquí y tu allá
De la mano hasta el final
