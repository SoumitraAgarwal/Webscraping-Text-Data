Elijah Blake,"No, no
I ain't ever trapped out the bando
But oh Lord, don't get me wrong
I know a couple niggas that do
I'm from a place where everybody knows your name
They say I gotta watch my attitude
When they see money, man they all start actin' strange
So fuck with the ones that fuck with you
They can never say I'm brand new

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular
I've been lovin' 'em thick, life is spectacular
I spend like I'ma die rich, nigga I'm flexin', yeah
Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday

I see all of these wanna-be hot R&B singers
I swear you all sound the same
They start from the bottom, so far from the motto
You niggas'll never be Drake
Shout out to OVO
Most of them prolly don't know me though
I stay in the cut, I don't fuck with no
Body but I D, that's a pun on No I.D
When nobody know my name
Runnin' for my dream wasn't hard to do
You break bread, I swear they all pull out a plate
Eat with the ones who starved with you
If I'm winnin' then my crew can't lose

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular

I spend like I'ma die rich, nigga I'm flexin', yeah
Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday

I heard since you got money
You changed, you're actin' funny
That's why I gets on my lonely
You be lovin' when change is a hobby
Who do you dress when you ain't got nobody?

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday

Elijah Blake,"The drinks go down and smoke goes up, I feel myself, got to let go
My cares get lost up in that crowd that go up, up and away yo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

Ain't kill my vibe, don't blow my high, don't doubt that he from the band though
I'm listening to this song, now I'm up up and away yo

Nights like this, I go all out, up so high, I can't come down
Let me live just for right now
Yeah, yeah, bite me, I'm so gone

Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way

When I'm out at night, I chase neon lights
All of my thoughts start to echo, yeah they start to echo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

So I'ma roll the dice, and I hope that I
Don't take more than I can handle, much than I can handle

Elijah Blake,"She don't live on planet Earth no more
She found love on Venus, that's her word
Said she needed space, time to explore
Now she movin' on and on and on and on

Is it might fault that you're broken, is it my fault that your'e high?
You caught me cheating with my ex-girlfriend, but instead of calling me I caught her

I was like ""man, oh shit, my new girl fuckin' with my old chick""
We both bad, so she switched, packed her bags, said she had to take a trip
To the otherside, the otherside, the otherside
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, to the otherside

Can we get back to how it was before?
If I can't have you, at least show me what's in store
And what I've made is [?] come forward more
Then we can go on and on and on and on

Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low

Baby I'm surprised you picked up this late at night
And I'm not tryna start a fight
But I hate the way we ended and the fact you got me cheated
I hate these new beginnings even though I am the reason
The only thing I love right now is you

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

[Hook 1]
I'm just trippin' off that Grigio
It sucks to see that you don't feel me though
Pour me a glass and let my feelings blow

Aw baby, aw baby, I ain't no drinker but it's gettin' me though

I don't know why your father never like me
Was it because of my [?]boy ways and this white tee? Your eye
Always thought your momma was a winner
Considering her only stayed together after all those years
You think that we could learn from them

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

Nights like this, we should be trippin' off that Grigio
Telling me secrets that nobody knows
Pour us a shot and cut the music on

Elijah Blake,"I see a midnight panther, so gallant and so brave
I found, I found the answers in the thunder and the rain
You made a promise that you would never leave me alone

That's what I get for trusting love

I see a fresh a cut diamond, coal minor's are dirty and cruel

That's who I love the most

When you smile slightly crooked
That's your style, don't you fix it
Girl you got a hold on me
Don't wanna play no games, this is do or die
And I don't mind if you get comfortable and gain a little weight
'Cause you're so fine, and just like whine you get a little better everyday

You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one

Elijah Levi,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Silhouettes bring confidence and peace to me.

Of an altogether admirable man.

I have fashioned a marble image
Of everything I'd like you to see.
Without the things I hate about me.

This is all that I am.
I am all that I am.
If I accept this, I am free,
In mind, In body.

So don?t ask; I won't tell.
Just read the insert of the c.d. in the player
Because the player's got it figured out,
With all the hype and the hooks but the facts left.

Elio e le Storie Tese,"Quando ero piccolo tutti mi sherzavano
Per le dimensioni del mio pene, ed io non stavo bene.
Soffrivo le pene per colpa del pene, ma più il problema non si pone:
Sì, perchè il pene mi dà il pane, son diventato un grande attore
E, benchè schiavo dell'amore, mi son comprato una moto.
E ora son schiavo della moto, non faccio più moto,
Infatti vado solo in moto,
Ma ora sono diventato un mito:
Ho rilanciato il film muto
Perchè sono muto,
E se vedrete il filmato sicuramente converrete con noi che questà è verità.

Di dimensione artistica.
Su di ciò la critica è concorde
Nel ritenermi sudicio.
Perchè non hanno capito
Non parlo perchè son rapito,
E poi in faccia non son mai inquadrato
Però dal pubblico son venerato:
Ho rilanciato il film muto
Perchè sono muto
E se fossi stato ceco
Avrei lanciato il film ceco
E se fossi stato m
Avrei lanciato il filmmm.
Dicon che faccio film penosi
Perchè lavoro col pene.
E insomma il pene mi dà il pane, il pene mi da sì la moto
Ma la moto non da pene
Perchè funziona bene
Si si la moto non da pene

Elio e le Storie Tese,"When I was just a boy,
Everyone made fun of me,
Just because my penis was enormous,
My mom said it was gorgeous.

I work in a circus because of my penis,
And everybody says: “No problem!”,
Because my penis makes my living,
Now I became a famous actor,
And even though I’m just a slave to love,
I bought myself a rasta Harley.

Now I’m a slave to my new Harley
I got it from Bob Marley,
It’s rasta ‘cause it was Bob Marley’s,
Sometimes I reggae with Ziggy Marley.

I will relaunch the silent movie
Because Bob told me that it’s groovie,
And if you see that forty jumps of that children
We will act like: this is fondamentally the truth.

Twelve inches, it’s one foot
Of artistic reality,
That is what attracted all the critics,
Not my acting ability,
Because they simply don’t get it,
I don’t speak ‘cause I eat spaghetti,
And so my face is normally off-screen,
All of the people still come to adore me,
And now they’ve made me into a big style.

I relaunched the silent movie,
Because I am silent,
And even if I had been born dumb,
I’d have relaunched the dumb movie,
And if I had been born XXX
I’d have relaunched the XXX movie
I am your fire and your Venus,
Because I’m acting with my penis,
And so my penis makes my living,
My penis is very forgiving,
All my Harleys don’t forgive me,
And I’m asking for forgiveness,
Yes yes my Harleys don’t forgive me,
And I’m asking for forgiveness.

Betrayal, you betrayed me
You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you
So much
You betrayed me with a kiss
You never really cared
It turned out to be wrong
So wrong
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal, you betrayed me
Discussing all the things with you
I told you all my secrets
You told it to the world
And laughed about it
I would have given anything
If you just asked me for
I was too good for you
Too good for you
Now I ask you
Why did it have to be like this
'Cause I miss you
Sometimes
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes

You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you

Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes

Deep blue and the sun is shining
But it seems that sometimes
There have to be some clouds

And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Deep inside
And suddenly I feel this destructive anger

Please come and calm this anger
You're the one to calm this anger
And if you can't calm this anger
It'll surely devour me this anger

And the air is getting colder

And thunder is rumbling loudly

It seems that it all will break down

Eine bleiche Magd da vor ihm stand.

Da lÃ¶schte sein Licht in ihrer Hand,
Der Wind verwehte drei Zeichen I'm Sand -

Sie hielt einen Becher in der Hand,
Der schimmerte bis auf zum Rand,
Wie Blut so rot und schwer.

Da nahm der Narre aus ihrer Hand
Den Becher und trank ihn leer.

Suddenly I remarked a sound in the winds
An angel like voice singing a tale

Through the cold and stormy night
Flies an angel
The black angel
White skin, red lips and long black hair,
Her wing is broken
The guardian angel

Listening breathless to her voice
Which has touched me right there in my heart
I felt the tears run down my face

Through the cold and stormy night
Flies an angel
The black angel
White skin, red lips and long black hair,
Her wing is broken
The guardian angel

The storm drags on her clothes
Like an invisible warrior
Her wing broke with a sound
So disgusting that it froze my heart
Her voice became weaker
Losing this fight of blackness

Why can't I hold you now

You just told me on the phone
Bad news I can't believe they're true

It caught you at your weakest point
Nothing left of your whole world
Besides chaos and smoking ruins
You thought there's nothing more to lose
You're wrong and he presents the proof

Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend

Why can't I hear you breath
Why can't I hold you now

You will need all of your strength
I hope that you can carry on
You fought the shadows of the ghosts
Now he's the one you will fight next
Knocking at your door as if
He is a guest you like to see
Don't let him in, just push him back
He is not welcome in your house

Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend

And who will break them

Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Maybe one day you will find the peace for your mind
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

It tears you all apart
Restrained emotions
You're denying all your feelings
And it will break you

Then I laid my soul into your hands

With his voice
He seduced me softly
Seduced you

When did I begin
To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows

So the first snowflakes melted away

Has gone
The autumn leaves

I felt the world hold its breath
And everything turned slower
All was silent, softened by the snow
The world is going to sleep now
In a freezing white coat
But I know what I will see its rebirth

Where flowers grew, now dust has covered everything

Onde eu possa plantar meus amigos

Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Na figura de um bravo feiticeiro

Tinha a dignidade de um mestre-sala
E ao acenar pelo mar na alegria das regatas
Foi saudado no porto

Pelas mocinhas francesas
Jovens polacas e por batalhoes de mulatas
Rubras cascatas
Jorravam das costas dos santos

Entre cantos e chibatas
Inundando o coracao do pessoal do porao
Que a exemplo do feiticeiro gritava entao

Glria aos piratas, s mulatas, s sereias
Glria farofa, cachaca, s baleias
Glria a todas as lutas inglrias

Nao esquecemos jamais

Que tem por monumento as pedras pisadas do cais

I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that is real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
And if its quite alright
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say its okay

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Sei que não vai dar em nada
Seus segredos sei de cór
Já conheço as pedras do caminho
E sei também que ali sozinho
Eu vou ficar, tanto pior
O que é que eu posso contra o encanto
Desse amor que eu nego tanto
Evito tanto
E que no entanto
Volta sempre a enfeitiçar
Com seus mesmos tristes velhos fatos
Que num álbum de retratos
Eu teimo em colecionar

Lá vou eu de novo como um tolo
Procurar o desconsolo
Que cansei de conhecer
Novos dias tristes, noites claras
Versos, cartas, minha cara
Ainda volto a lhe escrever
Pra lhe dizer que isso é pecado
Eu trago o peito tão marcado
De lembranças do passado
E você sabe a razão

Outro retrato em branco e preto
A maltratar meu coração

Ao luar descansa meu caminhar
Meu olhar em festa se fez feliz
Lembrando a seresta que um dia fiz
(Por onde for quero ser teu par)

Já me fiz a guerra por não saber
Que a terra encerra o meu bem querer
E jamais termina meu caminhar
Só o amor me ensina onde vou chegar

Rodei de roda andei
Dança da moda eu sei
Cansei de ser sozinha
Verso encantado usei

Nas lendas do caminho onde andei

No passo da estrada só faço andar 
Tenho a minha amada a me acompanhar
Vim de longe léguas cantando eu vim
Vou não faça tréguas sou mesmo assim

O meu peite percebeu
Que o mar é uma gota
Comparado ao pranto meu

Certo
Quando o nosso amor esperto
Logo o sol se desespera
E se esconde la na serra

Nem tao pouco se admite
Quem do nosso amor duvide

Até a lua
Se arrisca no palpite
Que o nosso amor existe
Forte ou fraco
Alegre ou triste

You would know
What's taking place in my mind

You're killing it with your reasons
Your world has got the fever
And you step on it and don't see it
Why do we end up being so lonely?

Why is this all just never enough

To stop your thinking

And I followed its flight with my eyes
I felt like I could take myself up there
And it just made me smile inside
And it just made me fall in love

Prima la verità poi mentirà lui

Si perda in congetture
In paure

My heart couldn't feel the beauty of the rising sun

Will somebody try?
Will I realize?

'Cause it's broken broken
Something got broken like stolen
Stolen, like if it was stolen
And hurting, hurting
I have been hurting and now
Only time will tell
Time will heal

Just pieces of truth that I chose to keep
No matter if now they are gone
No matter if I am alone
Still I can get back on my feet and walk on
As I know there was something to learn
I know there will always be more worth moving on for

Though, it's broken broken
Something got broken like stolen
Stolen, like if it was stolen
And hurting hurting
I have been hurting and now

And hurting hurting

I'd love to be one of those colorful early summer days
When everybody is happy that you came
Everybody smiles back at you as soon as your eyes cross their eyes
But something has to happen first
I know winter has to come before it blossoms

So it's broken broken
Something got broken like stolen
Stolen, like if it was stolen
And hurting hurting
I have been hurting and now
Only time will tell

Here she comes
You'd better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
It's true

It's not hard to realise
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up just to put you down
What a clown!

Everybody knows
The things she does to please
She's just a little tease
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're put down in her book
And you are number 37, have a look!
She's going to smile to make you frown
What a clown!

Little boy, she's from the street
So before you start you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
You can see it's true

Everybody knows the things
The things she does to please
She's just... just a little tease.. oh, she is just..
See the way she walks
Do you hear the way she talks?

That David played and it pleased the lord

The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learnt from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

Elisa,"Sarà difficile diventar grande
Prima che lo diventi anche tu
Tu che farai tutte quelle domande
Io fingerò di saperne di più
Sarà difficile
Ma sarà come deve essere
Metterò via I giochi
Proverò a crescere

Sarà difficile chiederti scusa
Per un mondo che è quel che è
Io nel mio piccolo tento qualcosa
Ma cambiarlo è difficile
Sarà difficile
Dire tanti auguri a te
A ogni compleanno
Vai un po’ più via da me

A modo tuo
Andrai
A modo tuo
Camminerai e cadrai, ti alzerai
Sempre a modo tuo
A modo tuo
Vedrai
A modo tuo
Dondolerai, salterai, canterai
Sempre a modo tuo

Sarà difficile vederti da dietro
Sulla strada che imboccherai
Tutti I semafori
Tutti I divieti
E le code che eviterai
Sarà difficile
Mentre piano ti allontanerai
A cercar da sola
Quella che sarai

A modo tuo
Andrai
A modo tuo
Camminerai e cadrai, ti alzerai
Sempre a modo tuo
A modo tuo
Vedrai
A modo tuo
Dondolerai, salterai, canterai
Sempre a modo tuo

Sarà difficile
Lasciarti al mondo
E tenere un pezzetto per me
E nel bel mezzo del
Tuo girotondo
Non poterti proteggere
Sarà difficile
Ma sarà fin troppo semplice
Mentre tu ti giri
E continui a ridere

A modo tuo
Andrai
A modo tuo
Camminerai e cadrai, ti alzerai
Sempre a modo tuo
A modo tuo

Soon enough they’ll be gone

Elisa,"If love is a kind of war
It’s cutting like a blade
The scars never show but they go so deep
And they never fade

This love is a kind of war
Why couldn’t you just stay
No you don’t even look at me now
Would you tell me straight

We've crossed the line 
Between love and hate this time
I can’t remember what the fight is all about 
Whatever I say you take it the wrong way
And you put me under, you walk away looking so sure

What was that you told me before
It’s only you who rocks my world
It’s only me who loves you so
Then why do I keep on feeling 

As if love was a kind of war
It’s cutting like a blade
The scars never show but they go so deep
And they never fade

And this love is a kind of war
Why couldn’t you just stay
But no you don’t even look at me now
Would you tell me straight

It never ends and nobody ever wins
I’m running for shelter
I wanna run into your arms

I can’t believe
We’re acting like enemies
And then when I hurt you 
It’s like a knife in my own heart

As if not how that was real before
It’s only you who rocks my world
It’s only me who loves you so
Then why do I keep on feeling

As if love was a kind of war
It’s cutting like a blade
The scars never show but they go so deep
And they never fade

And this love is a kind of war
Why couldn’t you just stay
But no you don’t even look at me now
Would you tell me straight

'Cause you lock the door 
You won’t go back anymore
Say that it’s over
Crying, screaming all about (screaming all about)
And we had it all and I’ve got it all wrong
You put me under but I wouldn’t be so sure

Haven’t you heard it all before 
It’s only you who rocks my world
And only me who loves you so
Then why do I keep on feeling

I know the time will finally past
And that I’ll see the sun again
Then happiness will be going to last

Well now we have to count them all
Look at them sit down on their knees
Praying hard for the old sixties
That’s something everyone agrees

Refrain
Bring it on, yeah back around
See how they twist & shout
Look fine, think twice
No wonder it seems pretty nice
Bring it on back around
Back to what money just can’t buy…

I feel like I don’t know why 
Why nobody told me
How she’d be flying through the sky

You broke my wings I was about to fly
And I crashed so sadly that I cried
You cut my feet off I felt so violently I could die

Thought I was a child
But when I kick you out you’ll doff that smile
See I’m not so weak, whatever you think
Can push and shove or give a slap, you’d better watch your back!

First it was to play then it has to stop
I see you turning off the light
And I know that means that you might

So that I can dry your tears

I want to write you sweet, milk & honey words.

My fingers are on the trigger ready to shoot you down
We’re playing like kids but it’s such fun cause then it feels

My patterned flowered dress, looks like there’s going to be such a mess

Refrain
Shuffling barefoot on the concrete
Still I’m asleep in the deep
Looks like it is such a funny trip 
Though artists almost ruined it

Who’s that boy riding on a bicycle
Dragging around his toy his girl’s got the doll
Where are they going to? Obviously to the zoo
It sounds like a brilliant idea, let’s follow them my dear!

Strings of pearls round my neck, I’m planting good words in your head
Now your hair has gone so wild, in blossom’s better than having two legs!

Refrain",Two Legs
Elisa Jo,"Torn all up inside
it'll end in suicide
washed my hands and cried

Focussing on the pain 
Running through my veins
it will never end

Your eyes your hands 
I let go of them
You lips, I let go of your kiss

You say finally that you may need me 
It's not the way I wanted
the more I see you the more I'm defeated.

You're here and i'm tired
cause i thought it died
this feeling inside

You shot me in the brain
then make my heart beat again
it drives me insane

Think that i'm still in love with you
and now i don't know what to do

Your eyes your hands 
I let go of them
You lips, I let go of your kiss

You say finally that you may need me 
It's not the way I wanted
the more I see you the more I'm defeated.",Defeated [Album Version]

Low down, down around a spot that's hot!

I've got no peace
I'm losin' my lease on livin'
Here's the how?
I'm tellin' you now to give in!

Oh, make 'em play that crazy thing again
I've gotta do that lazy swing again.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

I got my feet to misbehavin' now,
I got a soul that's not for savin' now.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

That dancin' demon has my feet in a trance,
'cause while I'm dreamin'
I go into that dance

And once you hear the haunting strain to it,
I'd like to bet you'll go insane to it.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

Elisabeth Welch,"When you come to the end of a perfect day
And you sit alone with your thought
While the chimes ring out with a carol gay
For the joy that the day has brought
Do you think what the end of a perfect day
Can mean to a tired heart
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray
And the dear friends have to part?

Well this is the end of a perfect day,
Near the end of a journey too.
But it leaves a thought that is big and strong,
With a wish that is kind and true.
For memory has painted this perfect day,
With colors that never fade.
And we find at the end of a perfect day,
The soul of a friend we've made.",I Still Suits Me
Elisabeth Welch,"Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose
When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Every day words
Seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose

I thought that love was just a word
They sang about in songs I heard
It took your kisses to reveal
That I was wrong, and love is real

Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart

Elise Witt,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete

Screaming from the pits of our own hells
Feeling like no one out there cares
Suffocating gasping for your air

You’re at the edge of the line
Will you wave your flag or fight
Don’t hide now don’t run for cover
What about all of the others
You’re fighting for you, and fighting for them

You gotta fight for your life
Because you’re someone else’s light
You gotta fight for your life
Because you’re someone else’s light
You gotta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)
You betta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)

We’re all infected with disease
Fading from our own disbelief
Fearing all that we are
Tortured and broken from all your battle scars

You’re at the edge of your mind
Will you wave your flag or fight
Don’t hide now don’t run for cover
What about your sisters and brothers
You’re fighting for you and fighting for them

You gotta fight for your life
Because you’re someone else’s light
You gotta fight for your life
Because you’re someone else’s light
You gotta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)
You betta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)

We’ve been cursed since birth and sent straight to work
Groomed to come in last and never in first
Time goes on it seemed to get worse
Mask all the hurt with a smile and a smirk
Damage that caused only God really knows
Seek the Most High to deal with these lows
Can’t get a hold of my mind take control
I climbed from the bottom of the totem pole
Despite all the spite that was aimed at my life
Cards were dealt I got a hand that I like
I was handed a light at the end of the tunnel
Use to cry me a river now I only see a puddle
With life I rock and roll no more singing the blues
Turned up the claps and drowned out the boos
As long as I move there’s no way to lose
Haven’t paid off my debt but I paid all my dues

You gotta fight for your life
Because you’re someone else’s light
You gotta fight for your life
Because you’re someone else’s light
You gotta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)
You betta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)

From all this hurt inside of me 
Someday, I will see 
If you will find your way right back to me 

You've played me too many times

I trusted you with my heart 
And now there's nothing, I can do or say to you

Love me like you love me
I remember how it used to be
There was no stronger love
And now I can't believe,
I was only too blind to see
That your love was inside of me
And now I don't have anything at all

Every night I think, as time just passes by
How I lived your love and how you made me cry
Now that I find I don't know what to do
My life is so empty, so empty alone without you

Without you, without you
I don't know what to do without you boy
Without you,
My love is in your hands
There's nothing left to live for
There's nothing left to do, without you

Every night that I sleep, I sleep with a fantasy
That you're here, its just you and me
Like it always was
But then I'm left to see that it was only a memory
And what's left is for me to be
Alone without your love",Without You

And it hurts even more
To have to be with somebody else
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away

With so many people
To love in my life
Why do I worry
About one

But you put the ""happy""
In my ""ness""
You put the good times
Into my fun
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door

We've tried the goodbye
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Than you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you
Than live in this pain and misery

They say time will
Make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows
And turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down
And once again you my friend are nowhere to be found
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Just walk on, walk on, turn and head for the door, just walk away.",Walk Away
Eliza Carthy,"I've given blowjobs on couches
To men who didn't want me anymore
Why they didn't tell me before
I have never been sure

And I sat and listened for hours
To boys that I'm not sure I liked
My evenings have passed me by

I have made myself a fool
In the company of men
I have cried in the night
With no light and then done it again

And they always think 
All I want is to stay
When what I really want
Is to get my fix and then get away

Now I don't want to be popular
And I don't want to be liked anymore
I don't want to be one of the beautiful people
Cause beautiful people are boring

I've given blowjobs on couches
To men who didn't want me anymore

And sober days alone

Eliza Carthy,"Last night when I saw him
Last night last week
When I saw my lover with a flush in his cheek
I went up to the window and I held out my hand
He's a demon lover and a spiritual man

But I think somebody will tell him
'Cause they think that he ought to know
I've been looking from my bedroom window and falling in love

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say
I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say

I'm in trouble 'cause I've been watching
Watching in your bedroom window
It's the skin I'm catching
Maybe I'll see you around tomorrow

Well I seek him in candlelight
Why do I seek
I can love his body and I don't have to speak
Well I stood by his shoulder and I blew on his fave
In his eyes were the pastures of a much greener place

But I think that stitches will mend him
And his feet choose a path that they know
Looking from his bedroom window and falling in love

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say
But I was dragged down to a level of dismay

I'm in trouble 'cause I've been watching
Watching from your bedroom window
That's the train I'm catching
And I don't want to see you alone no more",Train Song

People fly by, in the traffics boom
Knowing, just where you are blowing
Getting to where you should be going

don't let them get you down
Making you feel quilty about
Golden rain, will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve and now

Climbing, forever trying
Find your way out of the wild, wild wood
Now there's no justice
Only yourself that you can trust in

Eliza Doolittle,"If I woke up in the mornin'
And the world was back to front
There was sunshine in the evenin'
And the moon came out for lunch

I wouldn't mind walkin' backwards with you
At least we'd always know where we'd be goin' to
We could talk till we forget how to talk

And we could learn to laugh again
Like when we were children
We could learn to dance again
Like nobody is watchin'

If everyone was gettin' young
There'd be a smile on your face
If all the friends that passed away
Came back to this place

We'd be puttin' down the daisies
Drinkin' milk and feelin' lazy
There's no sense in any senses
What's the use in independence?

We could play of the tears that came
We could walk till we forget how to walk
And cool till we forget anything at all

And we would laugh again
Like when we were children
We could learn to dance again
Like nobody is watchin'

We could learn to look right
Into each others eyes
'Cause we got nothin' to hide

We got nothin' but to laugh again
Like when we were children
Like when we were children

Back to front, front to back
Will you come backwards with me
Backwards with me?

Will you come backwards with me
Backwards with me?

Eliza Doolittle,"I don't have the reflection,
Of anybody checking their face,
In the shade of my glasses,
One way ticket on the fast train,
And I'm solo all the way.

I could maybe read a novel,
To push away the trouble,
That sits in the pit of my tummy,
But I know that it will find me,
When I finish the last page.

An empty hand I wave goodbye,
I feel a tickle in my eye.

No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey, 
No hand held in mine,
No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey,
No hand held in mine.

Will I always feel it more,
On a day when there's a storm,
Or a raincloud, so dangerous and lonely,
No one ever told me,
That the darkness is my fault.

And I'm looking out the window,
And losing both my dimples,
As they enter the ends of my smile,
'Cause I am a thousand miles,
From the place I need to go.

And empty hand I wave goodbye,
I feel a tickle in my eye.

Sorting through my memories
Cross legged on the floor

My diaries and scrapbooks, oh
They seem to take me there
I was always posh spice and you wore zigzags in your hair

Would you know, know
Know me
If you saw me
Saw me, saw me
Nothing but hopes and living the moment
Where we were meant to be
Ooooohhhh
Those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking trough my old Polaroid
Photographs
Me and yoooouuuuuu
You always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Jut like Malcom in the middle
That was big when I was little

Oh this box is haunting me
I can't throw it away
School reports and birthdays cards
Feels like yesterday
Clip on diamantes
Makes me think of Friday nights
Leaving after class with me on the back of your bike

Would you know me, know me
Know me
If you saw me
Saw me, saw me
Nothing but hopes and living the moment
Where we were meant to be
Ooooohhhh
Those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking trough my old Polaroid
Photographs
Me and yoooouuuuuu
You always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Jut like Malcolm in the middle
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Like Nirvana and Lauryn Hill
They were big when I was little

Super nitendo
And club nights at Bagleys
Smirnoff ice
Open mic nights and Acne wonder where you ended up
'Cause I just can't thank you enough
Avirex jackets and strawberry ribena
Nike tn's dreams of Wembley arena

Ooooohhhh
Those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking through my old Polaroid
Photographs
Me and yoooouuuuuu
You always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Jut like Malcolm in the middle
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little

Eliza Doolittle,"Just a little boy in a big girls land,
Playin' at being king I took my kingdom back,
Throwing arrows at the window,
But they're not getting in though,
You made a move too late,
And now you're in checkmate

Bugging like a fly against my window pane,
Pain is what you gave me when you left that day,
That day I made a promise,
To raise my fisty cuffs,
You won't fool me twice,
Once is quite enough

They took him to the tower and cut off his head,
But I don't believe it,
And I've got the proof,
Standing right beside me,
When I compare him to you

Eliza Doolittle,"I got a pocket but it won't be full in a long time.
I got a locket but the photo's missing,
Cause nobody's listening at all.
I get my hopes up,
Full of what I think is love,
And when it blows up,
I jump on the band wagon,
With all the pretenders,
Wait a second

You can call it aches and pains and games,
The fire and the rain,
You can't explain,
So you can call it anything,
Call it what you like,
But don't call it love when it's really life

I'm not saying I don't believe in fairies,
I've seen them fly around a couple times,
But I don't like to label things like jars of jam,
Cause when I get to taste these things it's never what I planned,
And I won't be a pretender,
Wait a second

You can call it aches and pains and games,
The fire and the rain,
You can't explain,
So you can call it anything,
Call it what you like,
But don't call it love when it's really life

I don't wanna be rude to myself,
Stop leading me on,
Rude to myself,
If I don't try to be right can't be wrong,
I just wanna be true to myself,
And take the day as it comes,
True to myself,
I know I'm not the only one,
I know I'm no the only one

Eliza Doolittle,"As far as I remember,
We both speak English,
But you're talking a language,

Well it baffles me that you'll be wasting,
All your time with this negative hating,
And oh I don't know why you do it,
It makes you look so fucking stupid

Your mouth is moving,
But I can't hear,
What you're saying,
Hush your lips,
'Cause it's all bullshit,
So leave your ego at the front door,
I don't really care for it,
Cause it's all bullshit

Please stop all of your bitching,
You're talking in fiction,
Don't want to hear your tale tells

I can't see the vodka but you've had a refill
It's cause you're lapping up somebody else's spilt milk

Must be drunk off that insecure liquor
When you knock someone down to feel bigger,

Eliza Doolittle,"I always give away too much,
Too much of who I am,
And when I don't get no returns,
I have to start again

And it takes time,
To collect every little speck that makes me whole,

Eliza Gilkyson,"Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun;
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run;
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above;
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now, parched by the sun;
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run;
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart;
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me,
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see.

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return.
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam.
You can't be happy until you bring it home,
Home to the greenfields and me once again.",Greenfields

And the falling of the curtain

I will give you roses fair
For every secret you did share 
For all your words that flowed like wine
Roses at the end of time

Tonight I bless the hands of fate
That brought you to my doorway
Weary, worn and worth the wait
So willing to explore me
One rose for every vow you kept
One for every tear you wept
For all the moments you were kind

One rose for every dream you dared
One for every wrong repaired
For all that bound your heart to mine

Eliza Gilkyson,"Many years ago he looked out through a glass-less window.
All that he could see was Babylon.
Beautiful green fields and dreams,
And learn to measure the stars.
But there was a worry in his heart.

He said,
How could it come to this?
I'm really worried about living.
How could it come to this?
Yeah I really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

Then there came a day.
It moved out 'cross the Mediterranean.
Came to western isles and the freak young men.
And with their silver beards they laughed
At the unknown universe.
They could sit and guess God's name.

But they said,
How could it come to this?
We're really worried about living.
How could it come to this.
Yeah, we really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

Then there followed days of Kings, Empires and revolution.
Blood just looks the same when you open the veins.
But sometimes it was faith, power or reason as the cornerstone.
But the furrowed brow has never left his face.

He said,
How could it come to this?
We've been living in a landslide!
How could it come to this?
Yeah, we really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

Then there came a day, man packed up,
Flew off from the planet.
He went to the moon,
Now he's out in space,
Hey, fixing all the problems.
He comes face to face with God.

How could it come to this?
I'm really worried 'bout my creation.
How did it comes to this?

If I just took the time to stop all of my talking
Maybe I'd remember what it was, what it was, what it was

Oh, Apathy
Don't patronize me
Wake me up, I dare not sleep another hour
I'm waiting for the mission bells
My greatest fear is that I'll wait for you forever
Still I'll never hear the sound, hear the sound
I can't let that happen now

Oh, Apathy
Don't patronize me
Starry night is nothing like what I expected
Can't let it get under my skin
This is not the dream long ago imagined
Then again nothing ever is, ever is, ever is",Apathy
Elizabeth & the Catapult,"When I was girl I dreamed of my twin
She shared all my flaws she lived in my skin
She always forgave me no matter the sin
She finished my jokes before I begin

I dressed him my clothes I thaught him right from wrong
I told him to love me more than his bone
He ran efter a milk truck and never came back home",Complimentary Me

The green of the countryside had turned to blue 
I had the moon right on my fingertips

That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

Why shouldn't I know of love?
Why wait around when each age has a sage who has sung

To be sure when day is done
That the hour is coming when you'll be kissed
And then you'll be kissed again

The merry-go-round, the merry-go-round! 
Come and see the merry-go-round 
Go round and round and round!

Come let's rub the pony's hair
The pony's hair, the pony's hair
Lots of ponies that we can ride 
Around and around and around

Now let's climb on the pony's back
The pony's back, the pony's back
Pick up my reins and buckle my straps
Round and round and round

It's faster now my pony runs 
Up to the moon and down to the sun
My pony runs to the music and drums
Round and round and round

Now he runs as fast as the winds 
And gallops and trots and dances a jig 
My pony's tired and he wants to slow down 
Round and round and round

The pony stops and off I climb
It's off and off and off I climb
I'll come back and ride some other time

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song
Elizabeth!,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Elizaveta,"No need for flutes or violins
'Cause they won't mean a thing
When everything's been said.
No need for fancy cards or flowery prose
Though I suppose
They make us feel less bad.
No need for long, drawn-out explaining 
How and when, and why, this love came to an end
No need to to tell me so sincerely
You still want to be my friend.

It's a goodbye song
A little bitter, but it's sweet
You always wanted one
It comes a little late, but it's complete
It's from the heart
Please remember: I love you dearly
Although we have to part.

No need to gather up the evidence 
To justify the emptiness inside
No need to pray and turn for guidance to the Providence:
It simply won't provide.
No need to ask your friends 
For well-intentioned Good Advice 
They're happy to oblige.
(And though I know you want to)
No need to promise we will work it out
And start again
Let's simply turn the page.

It's a goodbye song
A little bitter, but it's sweet
And you always wanted one
It comes a little late, but it's complete
It's from the heart
Please remember: I love you dearly
Although we have to part.

So I won't cling to you
Because it's driving you away
No need for subterfuge
I've all run out of insights
And inspiring things to say.
No need to worry so about me
'Cause you know
I'm landing on my feet 

A little late, but I'm complete.
I speak from the heart:
Please remember, I love you dearly
Although we have to part.
Please remember, I love you dearly
Although we have to part.",Goodbye Song

Que você um dia
Me procuraria
Em busca de paz
Muito remorso, muita saudade
Mas afinal o que é que lhe traz?
A mulher quando é moça e bonita
Nunca acredita poder tropeçar.
Quando os espelhos, lhe dão conselhos
É que procuram em quem se agarrar
E você pra mim foi uma delas
Que no tempo em que eram belas viam tudo diferente do que é
Agora que não mais encanta, procura imitar a planta
As plantas que morrem de pé
E eu lhe agradeço por de mim ter se lembrado
Dentre tanto desgraçado que em sua vida passou
Homem que é homem faz qual o cedro que perfuma o machado que o derrubou

Eu sabia
Que você um dia
Me procuraria
Em busca de paz

Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink

To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun

Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow

Put their slippers on

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

One little thought to me

Drifted apart?

But, if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.

I lay awake night and ponder world troubles.
My answer is always the same.
That unless men put an end to all of this,
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.
Just because I'm in misery.
I'm not begging for no sympathy.
But if it's not asking too much,
Just send me someone to love.

Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love. 

Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do
Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do
Because strange things are happenin', babe, an' somethin' might happen to you

If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?
If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?
Because it's better to be without you, then to live on in misery

Hey!

Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too
Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too
You better change your ways pretty baby or somethin' might happen to you",Please Send Me Someone to Love
Elkie Brooks,"There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh ooh and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder.
There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, Don't be alarmed
Now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.
Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How ev'rything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven
Elkie Brooks,"I know it's late, I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are, both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry, no one will care girl
Look at the stars so far away
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don' you stay?

Deep in my soul, I've been so lonely
All of my hopes, fading away
I've longed for love, like everyone else does
I'll keep searching, even after today
So there it is, I've said it all
And here we are, what do we say?
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?

Elkie Brooks,"Out of the rain, under the shelter
I've been so long where the sun don't shine
Standing at the cross-roads, could have went either way
But now I've found you and the storm is behind

Out of the rain, out of the rain

Over the wall, I'm out in the open
Back on the right tracks, I'm feeling no pain
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles
I can see a long ways I feel love again

Out of the rain, out of the rain

There was a time I was taking no prisoners
Standing with a cold hear, standing alone
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon
I believe I can make it now, I feel like I belong

Out of the rain, out of the rain
Out of the rain, out of the rain
",Out of the Rain
Elkie Brooks,"Ome say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger
An endless, aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you, it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose",The Rose
Elkie Brooks,"I remember other days, how I used to weep
Over things you said to me, I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises ev'ry single vow
All you did was laugh at me but things are diff'rent now

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Ev'ry road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me

How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live-long day just what next thing to do
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Ev'ry road has a turning

Ella Baila Sola,"Me alegra tanto oir tu voz aunque dormido
por fin viajabas como en tus sueños
buscando un sitio para volver

why sin poder olvidar lo que dejas lo que has aprendido
van a cambiar las caras los sueños, los días why yo
lentamente te pierdo

Como un regalo que al ensuciarse tiró quien limpiaba
como un vaso depués de beber el trago más dulce
con un adiós, con un te quiero why con mis labios en tus dedos
para no pronunciar las palabras que dan tanto miedo,

te vas why te pierdo

Me alegra tanto escuchar tus promesas mientras te alejas
saber que piensas volver algún día cuando los sapos bailen flamenco
why yo te espero ya ves, aunque no entiendo bien que los sapos
puedan dejar de saltar why bailar lejos de su charco
Porque mis ojos brillan con tu cara why ahora que no te veo se apagan
porque prefiero que estés a mi lado aunque no tengas nada

te vas why te pierdo",Cuando los Sapos Bailen Flamenco
Ella Baila Sola,"Dices que así no estás bien pero no cambias nada
Dices que puedes hacer pero ni empiezas ni acabas
Luchas contigo esta vez no puedes salir corriendo
Es tan fuerte tu tormenta que fuera vez mojado el suelo

Y no recuerdas que tus botas nunca te fallaron
Que pisaste mil tormentas y siempre te has salvado
Solo tuviste que andar solo creer en tus pasos
Eres tú quien sabe más, eres quien saldrá ganando

Hay tanta fuerza que debes romper el silencio que abrazas
Silencio de miedos, silencio de planes
Que son posibles, que tienen llave
Si dejas atrás la pregunta de cómo saldrán

Silencio y respuesta, elige el que sea
La que te hace bien, la que no duela
Verás como se abre una puerta
Sólo tienes que entrar, entra

¿Qué día no salió el sol que día no despertaste?
Recuerda cuando creíste perderte y te encontraste
Tan fácil como que vives que sueñas que sabes
Tan tuyo que si tú entras tú también sales

Hay tanta fuerza que debes romper el silencio que abrazas
Silencio de miedos, silencio de planes
Que son posibles, que tienen llave
Si dejas atrás la pregunta de cómo saldrán

Silencio y respuesta, elige el que sea
La que te hace bien, la que no duela
Verás como se abre una puerta
Sólo tienes que entrar, entrar

Porqué no me arreglé para la última cita

se han ido la ilusión why las ganas de verte
pero me cuesta tanto decirlo a la cara

Que aquellos días oscuros
No empañan lo bueno que hubo

Yo sé que nunca te olvidaré
Que aquellos días oscuros
No empañan lo bueno

Llevo toda la mañana
Descartando esa llamada
Que creo que no debo hacer
Sólo es un capricho

Menos mal que no te he dicho nada
Mañana seré yo otra vez
Y seguro que sí

No me guardes el rencor

No me acuses si es por algo

I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,

I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
And send him on his way.

Don't try to patch it up

Tear it up, tear it up!

Push him out, fly him out,

Cancel him and let him go!

If you fly on separate beams,
Waste no time, make a change,
Ride that man right off your range.

And drum him out of your dreams.

If you root for different teams,
Waste no time, weep no more,
Show him what the door is for.
Rub him out of the roll call
And drum him out of your dreams.

You can't light a fire when the woods are wet,

No!

You can't make a butterfly strong,

You can't fix an egg when it ain't quite good,

And you can't fix a man when he's wrong!

You can't put back a petal when it falls from a flower,
Or sweeten up a fellow when he starts turnin' sour

Oh no! Oh no!

If his eyes get dull and fishy,
When you look for glints and gleams,
Waste no time,
Make a switch,
Drop him in the nearest ditch!
Rub him out of the roll call,
And drum him out of your dreams
Oho! Oho!

I went to wash that man right outa my hair,
I went to wash that man right outa my hair,

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
But baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?

I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside

How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay

When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?

Trust you'll think of me, dear, when you've time to spare
Praying you'll be happy is my only prayer

Sometimes it happens that way

And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Ella Fitzgerald,"The weather is frightening
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day

The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day
And everything's okay

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going
Leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke
They broke and, oh
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter-patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Long as I can be with you
It's a lovely day",Isn't This a Lovely Day

Bad times, may bar you from Sak's

Always have an ace in the hole

Was standin' by the sherrif's side

Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide-open country that I love
Don't fence me in
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever, but I ask you, please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my ol' saddle underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder 'till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon 'till I lose my senses
I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I'd tried so not to give in
I said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, darling, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ear
Don't you know little fool
You never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time that I do just the thought of you makes me stop
Before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear

That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song, in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not his smile, but such a lovely smile
That it's all right with me

You can't know how happy I am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?

It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not his lips, but they're such tempting lips
That, if some night, you are free

Ella Fitzgerald,"I feel a sudden urge to sing
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring
So, control your desire to curse
While I crucify the verse
This verse I've started seems to me
The ""tin pan-tithesis"" of melody
So to spare you all the pain
I'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

The night is young, the skies are clear
And if you want to go walkin', dear
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

I understand the reason why
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance
You can hear, dear mother nature murmuring low ""let yourself go""

So please be sweet, my chickadee
And when I kiss ya, just say to me
""It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious
It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely""

Ella Fitzgerald,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you

Night and day, day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

I think of you
Night and day, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me

And its torment won't be through
'Till you let me spend my life making love to you

Even without you
My arms fold about you

The night when you first were there
In love with my joy, delirious

Won't you turn that new leaf over
So your baby can be your slave?

Where we two can go and try settling down
There, I'll care for you forever

Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first nighting

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Oh, autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down

Yes, jaded roues and gay divorcees
Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain

Yes, lovers that bless the dark
On the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love

Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again",Autumn in New York

By constantly refusing to dance with me

Ella Fitzgerald,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last, 
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now","Bewitched, Bothered, And Bewildered"
Ella Fitzgerald,"It's the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
So it's all right with me

You can't know how happy I am that we've met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone too?

It's the wrong game with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat

Into heaven I'm hurled
I know how columbus felt
Finding another world

And with each beam, the same old dream
And every stop that we made, oh I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue
I peaked through the crack and looked at the track
The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?
I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peaked through the crack and I looked at that track
The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?
I thought about you",I Thought About You
Ella Fitzgerald,"I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same never be the same again
 
I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be

Tell me it's spring

Once love was king but kings can be wrong

Never be the same since we're apart

I know down deep inside",I'll Never Be the Same [*]
Ella Fitzgerald,"Like a ship at sea, I'm just lost in a fog
My mind is hazy, my thoughts are blue
Guess I'll always be kinda
Lost in a fog without you

[Chorus]
Waitin' night and day like a bump on a log
I'm goin' crazy; what can I do?
Help me find my way
'Cause I'm lost in a fog without you

It was sunny every day
The sky was fair above
But you took the light away
The day you took your love

Only fools like me could be tossed in a bog
I've got a heartache I never knew
Guess I'll always be kinda
Lost in a fog without you

Like a ship at sea, I'm lost in a fog
My mind is hazy, my thoughts are blue
Guess I'll always be kinda

Ella Fitzgerald,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it

If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know
Ella Fitzgerald,"Love was blown away by the night wind
And the dream we shared fell apart
Now I'm all alone in the night wind
Wind that brought the blues to my heart

Yesterday my arms were around you
And your lips revealed you were mine
Then the angry wind came and found you
Came to end the moment divine

Oh the night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't want me
Why is lover's lane filled with shadows
Stars no longer shine up above

I'll be waiting there in the shadows
'Til the night wind brings back our love
Oh the night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't, you don't want me

Why is lover's lane filled with shadows

I'll be waiting there, let you know I care
'Til that night wind brings back our love",Night Wind
Ella Fitzgerald,"What is so rare as a day in June?
'Till now we have never been told
The old question's answered by one that is new
What is so rare, dear, as you?
 
So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane 
Couldn't compare to you 
You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care
",So Rare [*]
Ella Fitzgerald,"You look at me and wonder
You look at me and doubt
Darling, your eyes are asking
""Will the flame burn out?""

No one is sure of sunshine
No one is sure of dawn
But I am sure
My love will live on and on

I'll be tired of you
When stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming
Then I'll be tired of you

This I know is true
When winds are tired of blowing
When grass is tired of growing
Then I'll be tired of you

Beyond the years till day is night
Till wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing
Beyond the years the echo of my only love
Will still be whispering, whispering

If my throbbing heart
Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you",Then I'll Be Tired of You

The reasons we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends, dear
But what can I tell my heart?

It's easy to say to strangers
That we played the game from the start
It's easy to lie to strangers
But what will I tell my heart?

When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will be bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring, ring, ring

I'm telling you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what will I tell my heart?

How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand

The moment you had touched my heart
And with you went my dream

All too soon
All too sweet
Was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there

What a shame that it's gone
All too soon

That only you in love could bring

The bottom fell from everything

For we whispered goodbye

Ella Fitzgerald,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

Ella Fitzgerald,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me

Heard they crowded the floor

Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

A kiss without a future in it.

But now when you turn the lamp down low

Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark

I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine

When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo
Ella Fitzgerald,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

With memories

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

Ella Fitzgerald,"We'll have a blue room
A new room for two room
Where every day's a holiday
Because you're married to me.

Not like a ballroom
A small room, a hall room
Where I can smoke my pipe away
With your wee head upon my knee.

We will thrive on, keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With mister and missus
On little blue chairs.

You sew your trousseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far from worldly cares
As our blue room far away upstairs!",The Blue Room
Ella Fitzgerald,"The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my boy is there

It his prince who walks
Into my dreams and talks

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
There's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor

Ella Fitzgerald,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punk drunk

I don't like quiet, and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again

I was miserly too.
I was more selfish
And crabby than a shellfish.

What love can do!

I'd give all my possessions
For you
I've got five dollars
I'm in good conditions
And I've got ambition
That belongs to you.
Six shirts and collars
Debts beyond endurance
On my life insurance
That belongs to you!

Ella Fitzgerald,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind
And once you told me I was mistaken

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

Now I even have to scratch my back myself
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

Ella Fitzgerald,"Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sings was this
Ah!
Poor Johnny one-note
sang out with ""gusto""
And just overlorded the place
Poor Johnny one-note
yelled willy nilly
Until he was bleu in the face
For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class
By himself, by gum!

Poor Johnny one-note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave,
While Verdi turned round in his grave!

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev'ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone.
Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo
All were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping,
Traffic ceased its roar,
And they tell us Niag'ra stood still.
He stopped the train whistles,
Boat whistles,
steam whistles,
Cop whistles,
all whistles bowed to his skill
Sing Johnny One-Note,
Sing out with ""gusto"" and
Just overwhelm all the crowd
Ah!
So sing Johnny One-Note, out loud!!
Sing Johnny One-Note
Sing Johnny One-Note out loud!",Johnny One Note
Ella Fitzgerald,"When you were very young
The world was younger than you
As merry as a carousel

The circus tent was thrilling
With every star in the sky
Above the rings you loved so well

Now the young world has grown old
Gone is the silver and gold

Sit there, and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl you're through
Just sit there, and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there, and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
That all you can count on are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use, old girl
You might as well surrender
Your hopes are getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender little boy
To cheer up little girl blue?",Little Girl Blue
Ella Fitzgerald,"Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you, speak my name
Softly, in my ear you, breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
Till loves own entrancing, music dies

All of my future is in you
Your every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When, two lips of coral, want to kiss

I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn't continue, I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart",Lover [Stereo Take][Version]
Ella Fitzgerald,"Summer journeys to Niagara and to other places
Aggravate all our cares, we'll save our fares
I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down right here in town

We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the zoo
It's very fancy on old Delancy Street, you know
The subway charms us so, when balmy breezes blow to and fro

And tell me what street compares with Mott Street in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by
The great big city's a wondrous toy just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers where true love conquers in the whiles
And starve together, dear, in Chiles
We'll go to Coney and eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll, where our first kiss we stole, soul to soul

And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show, they say
We both may see it close some day
The city's glamor can never spoil the dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy",Manhattan
Ella Fitzgerald,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've been married, and married, and often I've sighed
""I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always a bride""

I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
Yet remember these sweet words, ""'till death do us part""

I married many men, a ton of them
Because I was untrue to none of them
Because I bumped off every one of them
To keep my love alive

Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
At night he was a horse's neck to me
So I performed an appendectomy
To keep my love alive

Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right

Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
And now he plays where harps are just the thing
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive

(bridge)
I thought Sir George had possibilities
But his flirtations made me ill at ease
And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
To keep my love alive

Sir Charles came from a sanatorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium
To keep my love alive

Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly

Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide,
He killed his dad and that was patricide
One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side

Ella Fitzgerald,"It seems we stood and talked like this, before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes, you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happenin' again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happenin' again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when

When you're awake, the things you think
Come from the dream you dream

And we couldn't have change since the last time,
To my joy and delight,
It's a new kind of love at first sight.
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Every meeting's marvelous pastime.
You're increasingly sweet,
So whenever we happened to met
I greet you 

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and 

At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.

Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years.
In the morning I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out.
It will be just as sweet,
And an air that I'll live to repeat:

Ella Fitzgerald,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!
Till everything he's got belongs to me!

And everything I've got belongs to him!
And everything I've got belongs to us!",Ev'rything I've Got

I took one look at you, that`s all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still,
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

Through all my school days, I hated boys
Those April Fool days brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato, Love, I thought a sin
But since your kiss, I`m reading Missus Glyn!",My Heart Stood Still
Ella Fitzgerald,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of may, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true

My romance doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a thing but you",My Romance
Ella Fitzgerald,"I work at the Palace ballroom, but gee that palace is cheap
When I get back to my chilly hall room, I'm much too tired to sleep
I'm one of those lady teachers, a beautiful hostess you know

One that the palace features, at exactly a dime a throw.
Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh how they weigh me down.

Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys, tough guys who tear my gown.
Seven to midnight I hear drums, loudly the saxophone blows,
Trumpets are tearing my ear-drums, customers crush my toes.
Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance

All that you need is a ticket,
Come on big boy, ten cents a dance.
Fighters and sailers and bow-legged tailors
Can pay for their tickets & rent me
Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbor
Are sweethearts my good luck has sent me
Thought I've a chorus of elderly bows
Stockings are porous with holes at the toes
I'm here till closing time
Dance and be merry it's only a dime
Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance

All that you need is a ticket.
Come on, come on big boy, ten cents a dance.",Ten Cents a Dance
Ella Fitzgerald,"Wait 'til you see him
See how he looks
Wait 'til you hear him laugh.

Painters of paintings
Writers of books
Never could tell the half.

Wait 'til you feel
The warmth of his glance,
Pensive and sweet and wise.

All of it lovely
All of it thrilling
I`ll never be willing to free him.

You won`t believe your eyes.",Wait Till You See Her
Ella Fitzgerald,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people i knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as i walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day i've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British museum, had lost its charm

How long i wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, i saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Ella Fitzgerald,"It's the wrong time, and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song, in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
That it's all right with me

You can't know how happy i am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?

It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips
That, if some night, you are free
Then it's all right, yes, it's all right with me",It's All Right with Me [#]

As juliet cried, in her romeo's ear,

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew, and never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad (Coward)
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp

Ella Fitzgerald,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun [#]
Ella Fitzgerald,"Savoy, the home of sweet romance,
Savoy, it wins you with a glance,
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.

What joy, a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you

It wins you at a glance,
Gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things [#]
Ella Fitzgerald,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,

A kiss made of gold,
Made of lover's gold
Because the kiss was true.

Once there was a fool

But, just like a fool,
Its worth she never knew!

Now she walks alone and broken hearted,
For you've heard it told,

Are soon parted!

How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star

I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes",I Used to Be Color Blind

I see a puppy upon a summer's day

And tho' it's wrong to be
I long to be

I want to be lazy
I want to be out in the sun
With no work to be done

Stretching and yawning
And let the world go drifting by

I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
'til I sleep
Like a child would

With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm
Killing time
Being lazy

Life is short
And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly
Before you know, it's over

In such a hurry to pack my things and fly
To a spot
Where it's nice and hot
And hear the birdies sing
While I'm being",Lazy

One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you

Gazing tenderly
Down upon her knee

I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from

I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see

You can have him, I don't want him

And a dream is a fairytale

You don't need a magic wand
To see all that lies beyond
If you just believe in fairyland
Fairyland appears

Dream away, little man
Dream as long as you can
Don't grow up, I beg of you

And for children dreams come true",Dreams Are Made for Children

If it ain't gross, it's net
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't sis, you can't miss
It's got to be your brother
Can't you see it's gotta be
One way or the other?

If you don't spend, you bank
If it ain't Dee, it's Frank

Ella Fitzgerald,"Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light
Or if I were a banner, I'd wave

Ask me how do I feel
Little me with my quiet upbringing
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch
I'd start popping my springs
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding

Yes, I knew my morale would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack
Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked

Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
Well, if I were a salad
I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
Or if I were a gate, I would swing
Have a fling almost any old thing
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, ding dong",If I Were a Bell

I'll cut out the cake just for your sake
Baby, come on and knock me a kiss

I like pie; I hope to die just to get a load of this
When you get high, doggone the pie
Baby, come on and knock me a kiss

When you pressed your little lips to mine
It was then I understood
They taste like candy, brandy, and wine
Peaches, bananas, and everything good

I love jam and no flim flam; scratch that off my list
This ain't no jam; the jam can scram

Late December back in '63
What a very special time for me
'Cause I remember what a night

Oh, what a night

But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feeling when she walked
In the room and I
As I recall it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinnin' my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feeling when she walked
In the room and I
As I recall it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

I think of you
And that's the time
I feel so blue
The rain starts to fall
Across my window's pane
But it's raining teardrops
From my eyes

If you see tears
Here in my eyes
It's just because
You said goodbye
So, baby, won't you hurry?
Because I love you so
And it's raining teardrops
From my eyes

Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be sad and lonely
If you were here with me

What makes you look so blue?
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you, sure as one and one make two
What's your story, morning glory?
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So, won't you let me know your point of view?

What is your story, morning glory?
You've got me worried too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you

I know that I'm the slave, you're the queen

Ella Fitzgerald,"In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
He can play piano any way that you like it
But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar
When he plays, it's a ball
He's the daddy of them all

The people gather around when he gets on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
And when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar
A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano
And we all know
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance
The cats all holler ""Hooray""
You'll hear them say, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

He goes where all the angry young men go
Recites poetry, like young

And we're homin' it, like now
We spin records on cloud number seven

Love warm as candle glow

You make me feel like spring has sprung

I want to go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray

Ella Fitzgerald,"I fetch his slippers, fill up the pipe he smokes
I cook the kippers, laugh at his oldest jokes
Yet here I anchor, I might have had a banker
Boy! what love has done to me
His nature's funny, quarrelsome half the time
And as for money, he hasn't got a dime
And here's the joker, I might have had a broker
Boy! what love has done to me
When a guy looks my way
Does he get emphatic, say he gets dramatic?
I just want to fly 'way
But if I left him I'd be all at sea
I'm just a slavey, life is a funny thing
He's got the gravy, I got a wedding ring
And still I love him, there's nobody above him
Boy! what love has done to me
His brains are minus,
Never a thought in sight

And yet his highness
Lectures me day and night;
Oh where was my sense
To sign that wedding license?
Boy! What love has done to me!
My life he's wrecking, bet you could find him now
Out somewhere necking somebody else's frau
You get to know life when married to a low life
Boy! what love has done to me
I can't hold my head up
The butcher, the baker, oh no he's a faker
Brother I am fed up
But if I left him he'd be up a tree
Where will it wind up, I don't know where I'm at
I make my mind up, I oughta leave him flat
But I have grown so, I love that dirty so-and-so
Boy! what love has done to me.",Boy What Love Has Done To Me
Ella Fitzgerald,"Near Barcelona, the peasant crooned
The old traditional Spanish tunes
The Neapolitan street song sighs
You think of Italian skies

Each nation has a creative vein
Originating a native strain
With folk songs plaintive and others gay
In their own peculiar way

American folk songs, i feel
Have a much stronger appeal

The real American folksong is a rag
A mental jag
A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues

The critics called it a ""joke song"" but now
They've changed their tune, and they like it, somehow

For it's inoculated with a syncopated sort of meter, sweeter
Than a classic strain, boy you can't remain, still or quiet, for it's a riot

The real American folksong
Is like a fountain of youth
You taste, and it elates you, and then, invigorates you

Her figure was divine

She had a yen for all the sailors
Fishermen and gobs and whalers
She had a most immoral eye
They called her Lorelei

She created quite a stir
And I want to be like her

I want to be like that gal on the river
Who sang her song to the ships passing by
She had the goods and how she could deliver
The Lorelei

She used to love in a strange kind of fashion
With lots of hey-ho-de-ho-hi-de-hi
And I can guarantee I'm full of passion
Like the Lorelei

I'm treacherous, yeah, yeah
Oh, I just can't hold myself in check
I'm lecherous, yeah, yeah
I want to bite my initials on a sailor's neck

Each affair has a kick and a wallop
For what they crave I can always supply
I want to be just like that other trollop
The Lorelei

I want to be just like that other trollop

I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

She got boyfriends by the dozen, when she sang in a lowdown way
She was a positive sensation
The songs that she sang would never miss
My cousin was my inspiration
That`s how I got like this

I got a cousin in Milwaukee
She`s got a voice so squawky
And though she`s tall and kind of gawky
Oh, how she gets the men

Her singing isn`t operatic
It`s got a lot of static
What makes your heart get acrobatic
Nine times out of ten

When she sings hot, you can`t be solemn
It sends the shivers up and down your spinal column
When she sings blue, the men shout, ""What stuff!""
That baby is hot stuff

So if you like the way I sing songs,
If you think that I`m a wow
You can thank my squawky cousin from Milwaukee
Because she taught me how

For I've certainly turned the corner

Love's the only thing that matters

Who cares if the sky cares to fall in the sea
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!

I've done pretty well I think

Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic

Now my heart's antiseptic

I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;

Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh

I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white",White Christmas
Ella Fitzgerald,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
In his place is the new bird
He's singing our song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?""
We'll say ""No man, but you can do the job when you're in town""
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though you know, kids are chillin'
We'll frolick and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh ...)",Winter Wonderland
Ella Fitzgerald,"Let's get away from sleigh bells
Let's get away from snow 
Let's make a break some Christmas, dear
I know the place to go

How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea? 
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree? 

How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do? 
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island 
You will never stray for everyday 
Your Christmas dreams come true

Ella Fitzgerald,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!

Ella Fitzgerald,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are

The darkest night would shine

Ella Fitzgerald,"Back in the days of knights in armor
There once lived a lovely charmer
Swimming in the Rhine
Her figure was divine

She had a yen for all the sailors
Fishermen and gobs and whalers
She had a most immoral eye
They called her Lorelei

She created quite a stir
And I want to be like her

I want to be like that gal on the river
Who sang her song to the ships passing by
She had the goods and how she could deliver
The Lorelei

She used to love in a strange kind of fashion
With lots of hey-ho-de-ho-hi-de-hi
And I can guarantee I`m full of passion
Like the Lorelei

I`m treacherous, yeah-yeah
Oh, I just can`t hold myself in check
I`m lecherous, yeah-yeah
I want to bite my initials on a sailor`s neck

Each affair has a kick and a wallop
For what they crave, I can always supply
I want to be just like that other trollop

Ella Fitzgerald,"That old black magic has me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, down and down I go
All around I go, in a spin
Loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic

To her boyfriend, ""fare thee well""
As Columbus announced
When he knew he was bounced,

As Abelard said to Eloise,
""don't forget to drop a line to me, please""
As Juliet cried, in her romeo's ear,
""romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

Just one of those crazy flings

Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun

Ella Fitzgerald,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Ella Fitzgerald,"I hadn't anyone till you, I was a lonely one till you
I used to lie awake and wonder, if there could be
A someone in this wide world, just made for me
And now I see I had to save my love for you

I never gave my love till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
Cupid took a hand in it

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Ella Fitzgerald,"Come to me, my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
You know, dear, that I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Please, cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

Ella Fitzgerald,"Reach for tomorrow
Today belongs to the past
The golden hopes of your yesterdays
Can all be yours at last

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your head in the sky
You may get hurt
In a thousand ways
But give it one more try

Have no regret about
Forget about
The chances you missed
In days to come
I know there's something
Better than this

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your dreams ever new
No matter how many times it seems
That dreams are not for you

Reach for tomorrow
And make them all come true",Reach for Tomorrow
Ella Fitzgerald,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Ella Fitzgerald,"If you've never had to count a million sheep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue
If you've never had to cry yourself to sleep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue

I know I could go on laughing and troubled
Plain trouble
But when it concerns the heart
The pain seems doubled

Never worry about a little hurt or two
There's nothing at all bothering you
If you've never had a pal who stole your gal
Then you've never known you've never been blue

Something that this life will mind is plain, honey
That's funny
When you're miles away from home
It's not so sunny

No one ever knows what I go through
While someone at home is babying you
If you've never had to miss a goodnight kiss
Then you've never known you've never been blue",Then You've Never Been Blue
Ella Fitzgerald,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?

Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

Ella Fitzgerald,"It begins to tell 'round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown
Supper time I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it too

When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending?
Darlin', I need you; lately I find
You're out of my heart and I'm out of my mind

Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

The mystery of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The memory of our caravan

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Ella Fitzgerald,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A home that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the grief and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy
Give me the simple life",Give Me the Simple Life

But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold

When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny

I've known the thrill of loving you.
And that alone is more than I was created for

Ella Fitzgerald,"Now you say you're lonely 
You cry the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
'Cause I cried, I cried, I cried a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said?
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

And now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river

Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry, cry, cry me a river
Cry me a river

Could it be a river of tears I cried instead?

Ella Fitzgerald,"Good morning heartache
You old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache
Thought we said goodbye last night

I turned and tossed until it seems you have gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you
Good morning heartache what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues

Aglow with it's cool evening light
But shining at night, in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand

They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told

But I'll have none except the one I love

Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.

My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig,
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big.

You're lunching at twenty-one and watchin' your diet,
Declining a Charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
And this could be the start of something big.

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
Who knows what's written in the magic book.
But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
Invite her in without a second look.

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at sardi's,
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand,
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand.

This could be the start of something very big,
Why don't you play your part?
Please give your heart to me, and see.
This could be the start of something wonderful,
Why don't you take a chance?
Just try romance with me, and see.

Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,
And this must be the start of something,
This could be the heart of something,
This could be the start of something big.",This Could Be the Start of Something Big [#][*]

Ella Fitzgerald,"All of me, why not take all of me?
Baby, can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I'll never use them
Take my arms, I want to lose them

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I want to lose 'em

Ella Fitzgerald,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I pine, for you dear only
Why haven`t you seen it?
I`m all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it`s me you`re wronging
I tell you I mean it
I`m all for you, body and soul

I can`t believe it, it`s hard to conceive it
That you`d turn away romance.
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending 
Unless I can have
Just one more chance, dear

My life a wreck you`re making
My heart is yours for just the taking
I`ll gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul",Body and Soul
Ella Fitzgerald,"Call me darlin', call me sweetheart, call me dear
Thrill me, darlin', with words I want to hear
In your dark eyes so smilin' a promise I see
But your two lips won't say you care for me

Oh my darlin', if my daydreams would come true
You would meet me at a secret rendezvous
And I'd find the paradise that lies deep in your eyes
Call me darlin', call me sweetheart, call me dear",Call Me Darling [*]
Ella Fitzgerald,"Darn that dream I dream each night
You say you love me and hold me tight
But when I awake and you're out of sight
Oh, darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit sky
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that one-track mind of mine
I can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream I never have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true
Oh, darn that dream",Darn That Dream
Ella Fitzgerald,"Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

I'm say Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

I said Georgia
Oh Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've flown around the world in a plane
I've settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted, but I can't get
Started with you

Around the golf course I'm under par
And all the movies want me to star
I've got a house, a show place, but I get no
Place with you

You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you
Scheme, just for a sight of you
Dream, both day and night of you
And what good does it do?

In England I'm presented at court
But you've got me downhearted, cause I can't get

Ella Fitzgerald,"Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do?

Have you ever felt
A gentle touch and then a kiss
And then and then
Find it's only your imagination again? Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too",Imagination
Ella Fitzgerald,"Heart and soul took control
Took control of me
Paid my dues, spread the news
Hands across the sea

And it's only what you do
That keeps coming back on you
And it's only what you say
That can give yourself away

Needed to be free

Ella Fitzgerald,"It's a pity to say goodnight
Because I never saw stars so bright
But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
Give me a goodnight kiss

It's a pity to say farewell
Because the man in the moon won't tell
But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
Give me a goodnight kiss

How's about tomorrow night just you and me?
I'll be waiting for you darling 
Underneath the apple tree

Ella Fitzgerald,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way
Ella Fitzgerald,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new

Ella Fitzgerald,"The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till Im near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
Its just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

Ella Fitzgerald,"Now we'll say till something do us part
That old dad of mine ain't got a heart
Any girl who's out for pleasure
Thinks of marriage only at her leisure
As it is, they've got the horse behind the cart

When my pop said we must wed,
He kind of wowed me, still I'm read-y
But one thing must be clear
At this time

I'll be hard to handle
I promise you that
And if you complain
Here's one little Jane
Who'll leave you flat

I'll be hard to handle
What else can I be
I say with a shrug
I think you're a mug
To marry me

When you first threw me a gander
I was willing to philander
But I never thought I'd have to be a bride
Now you're gonna find tough sledding
I don't want no shotgun wedding
I was only along for the ride

I'll be hard to handle
I'm telling you plain
Just be a dear
And scram out of here
I'm gonna raise cain

I'll be hard to handle
My bridges are burned
This wedding's a gag
And you're in the bag
Where I'm concerned

I'll be hard to handle
When we've said, ""I do""
See there's no hope
I just got a dope
When I took you

I'll be living my life in bed
But they always will be twin beds
And I warn you, you'll be living like a monk
Our affair is now a past one
So don't think you've pulled a fast one
Just remember, I think you're a punk!

I'll be hard to handle
I'm no ball and chain
I'll find some means
To call the Marines
I'm gonna raise cain

Gonna raise cain
I'm telling you plain
I'm gonna raise cain",I'll Be Hard to Handle
Ella Fitzgerald,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads

Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things

The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings

This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands

I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned

Ella Fitzgerald,"Before I met you no one attracted me
No love thoughts worried or distracted me
My disposition kept exempting me
Until you started in preempting me

And all this while, you've really been tempting me
Maybe you can tell me what we ought to do

Now that you've got me going, what you gonna do?
Is it up to me? Is it up to you?
What kind of game is this we've begun?
Was it done, just for fun?

We have necked, till I'm wrecked
Won't you tell me what you expect?
Is this to be a case of kiss and never tell?
Folly and farewell
Heaven or maybe hell

Which is it going to be, love or gin?
Wife or sin? Let's begin

Ella Fitzgerald,"Turn off that charm
I'm through with love for awhile
I'm through and yet, you have a fabulous smile
So if I forget

Remind me
Not to find you so attractive
Remind me
That the world is full of men

When I start to miss you
To touch your hand
To kiss you
Remind me
To count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

I get my heart, well in hand, and I'm certain
That I can take you, or leave you alone
Then you begin that beguine again
And boom, I give in , again
I have a will made of steel, my friend
But when it seems about to bend

Remind me
Not to mention that I love you
Remind me
To be sorry that we met

Although I adore you
Remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret

So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me
Don't let me kiss you please, remind me
Unless, my darling, you forget",Remind Me

She only knew that he had spied her there

There is nothing for me but to love you,

While that ole band keeps on playin'
One of your old favourite songs from way back when

Ella Fitzgerald,"I love the East, I love the West
And North and South they're both the best
But I only want to go there as a guest
'Cause I love being here with you

I love the sea, I love the shore
I love the rocks and what is more
With you there, they'd never be a bore
'Cause I love being here with you

Singing in the shower, laughing by the hour
Life is such a breezy game
Love all kinds of weather 'long as we're together
I love to hear you say my name

I love good wine and fine cuisine
And candle light; I like the scene
But, baby, if you know what I mean
I love being here with you
I love being here with you

I like a dance by Fred Astaire
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair
But I think to tell you's only fair
That I love being here with you

And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day
His utter charm takes me away
But don't get me wrong, how do you say
I love being here with you

Basie's band a-swinging, I like Ella's singing
Because there's something else, you know
They know how to say it, they know how to play it
They wind it up and let it go

I love the thrill of New York shows
I'd love to kiss Durante's nose
But I'd like to say before I close
That I love, and is love, I love being here with you",I Love Being Here With You [#]
Ella Fitzgerald,"I've been a roaming Romeo
My Juliets have been many
But now my roaming days have gone
Too many irons in the fire
Is worse than not having any
I've had my share and from now on:

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting ev'rything I've got on you

I'm giving all my love to one baby
Heaven help me if my baby don't come through

I've got a great big amount
Saved up in my love account
Honey
And I've decided
Love divided
In two
Won't do

Heaven help me if my baby don't come through

I've tried to love more than one
Finding it just can't be done

Be true

Ella Fitzgerald,"Perdido
I look for my heart
It`s perdido
I lost it way down in Torito
The day the fiesta started

Bolero
I sway that they play the Bolero
I kissed me the listing sombrero
And that`s when my heart departed

High, was the sun when I held him close
Low, was the moon when we said, adios

My heart ever since is Perdido
I know I must go to Torito

Ella Fitzgerald,"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Ella Fitzgerald,"Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't upset your cart when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your beat; she's so close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another, too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
So be firm and be fair, be sure, beware

Ella Fitzgerald,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet

He's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when he passes each girl
He passes goes, ah

Oh, but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him?
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day
When he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead, not at me

Ella Fitzgerald,"Day in - day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out
Day out - day in

When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain - come shine

I meet you and to me the day is fine

In the sunny South when I was a tot so high
And now that I have grown
And myself alone

Cradle me where Southern skies
Can watch me with a million eyes

Lullaby of the leaves

Cover me with Heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two
Sing me to sleep

Familiar to me, I've heard it before

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Ella Fitzgerald,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura [From Laura]

Doing what he can

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British Museum had lost its charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

And everything's okay

Isn't it a lovely day to be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way; now you have to remain

Just as you were leaving me at sea
The clouds broke and, oh, what a break for me

I can see the sun up high though we're caught in a storm
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter-patter
'Cause it really doesn't matter
If skies are gray
'Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day",Isnt It a Lovely Day (With Louis Armstrong)
Ella Fitzgerald,"The evening breeze
Caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

The shore was kissed
By sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly",Tenderly (With Louis Armstrong)
Ella Fitzgerald,"There are many, many crazy things
That will keep me loving you
And with your permission
May I list a few?

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again
On that bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, they can't take that away from me",They Cant Take That Away from Me (With Louis Armstrong)
Ella Fitzgerald,"I've got your number
I know you inside out
You ain't no Eagle Scout
You're all at sea

Oh yes, you brag a lot
Wave your own flag a lot
But you're unsure a lot
You're a lot like me, oh

I've got your number
And what you're looking for
And what you're looking for
Just suits me fine

We'll break the rules a lot
We'll be damn fools a lot
But then why should we not
How could we not combine when

I've got your number
And I've got the glow you've got
I've got your number
And more

The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?

In life, in death oh Lord abide with me

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

And the bars are packed with couples calling for more

What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you

And took put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
Without a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took it, she took it

Ella Fitzgerald,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Ella Fitzgerald,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

They're making me feel, I'm home

Ella Fitzgerald,"There was a boy
A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon

There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain

Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo, por favor 
Prá que ela acorde alegre como o dia 
Oferecendo beijos de amor

Felicidade sim",A Felicidade
Ella Fitzgerald,"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

Ella Fitzgerald,"How insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence?
What was I to say?
What can you say when a love affair is over?

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still

Ella Fitzgerald,"Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us.

And a window on the mountains and the sea - how lovely!

This is where I want to be, here, with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember.

A bitter, tragic joke have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my love.",Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars (Corcovado)
Ella Fitzgerald,"Sad is to live in solitude
Far from your tranquil altitude
Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream
That never can be, will never be

So high my heart can't bear the strain
A heart that stops when you pass by
Only to cause me pain

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known

And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Ella Fitzgerald,"The boys watch the girls while the girls watch the boys who watch the girls go by
Eye to eye, they solemnly convene to make the scene

Guys talk ""girl talk"", it happens everywhere
Eyes watch girls walk with tender lovin' care

Ella Fitzgerald,"Speak low when you speak, love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift; like ships adrift, we're swept apart too soon

Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon

Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief

We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me? Speak love to me and soon

Ella Fitzgerald,"I feel the autumn breeze; it steals cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp and in its song
There is sadness because there's no you

The lonely autumn trees, how softly they're sighing
'Cause summer is dying; they know that in my heart
There's no gladness because there's no you

The park that we walked in, the garden we talked in
How lonesome they seem in the fall
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall

In spring we'll meet again; we'll kiss and recapture 
The summertime rapture we knew and from that day
Never more will I say, ""There's no you""

Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day

We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place

Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!",All the Things You Are
Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh listen, sister,
I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,
There ain't no reason
Why I should love that man.
It must be something that the angels done plan.

Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,
I got to love one man till I die.
Can't help loving that man of mine.
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).
Can't help loving that man of mine.
When he goes away
That's a rainy day,
But when he comes back that day is fine,
The sun will shine!
He kin come home as late as kin be,
Home without him ain't no home to me.
Can't help loving that man of mine.

My man is shiftless
An' good for nothing too
(He's my man just the same)

He's never round here
When there is work to do.
He's never round here when there's working to do.

The roof is leaking in,
But he don't seem to care.
He kin be happy
With just a sip of gin.
Ah even love him when his kisses got gin!",Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man
Ella Fitzgerald,"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit a pats through my brain
So darn persistent
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane
Comes in the morning
Without any warning
And hangs around me all day
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it
I hope it listens when I say

You've got me on the go

What a mess you're making

Why I'm always shaking
Just like a fliver

Start a hopping
Never stopping
To find at night no work has been done

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy

Won't you take a day off
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy

Oh, how I long to be the girl I used to be

Oh won't you stop picking on me

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew, and never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate

I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere,
And slightly dopey gent

You're my funny valentine,
Sweet comic valentine,
You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable,
Yet, you're my favorite work of art.

Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee
That time won't erase his name

The fact is, the only work
That really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love, you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how

Oh, sweet and lovely

Oh lady be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady be good, to me

I'm all alone in this big city

Won't you tell me where my love can be?

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me",My Ship

On the wayward ways of this wayward town.

Love that`s only slightly soiled,

Who`s prepared to pay the price,

For a trip to paradise?

Better far than they.

Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew

Like the kicker in a julep or two

You might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of
Yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature
Rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julies

Waiting for the plane to leave

""You can't take those guitars on board""
But the boys in the band just smiled
Heard it all before

I can hear the engines roaring

As she waits, ""Where are those guys?""
Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky

And now the sun is beginning to rise
It's like looking down on Paradise
There's a ball of fire that's burning
Giving life

I know that I'm bound to answer
When you propose
Anything goes
Anything goes",Anything Goes
Ella Fitzgerald,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I`m with you once more, under the stars
And down by the shore, an orchestra`s playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
'Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don`t let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
'Till the stars that were there before return above you
'Till you whisper to me once more, darling, I love you

And we suddenly know What heaven we`re in
When they begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Ella Fitzgerald,"Every time we say goodbye
I die a little
Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little

Why the Gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it

There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye

When you're near
There's such an air of spring about it

Ella Fitzgerald,"From this moment on, you for me dear
Only two for tea dear, from this moment on
From this happy day, no more blue songs
Only whoop-dee-doo songs, from this moment on

For you've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
From this moment on, you and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone, from this moment on

From this happy day, no more blue songs
Only whoop-dee-doo songs, from this moment on

Ella Fitzgerald,"Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love
Get out of town
Be good to me, please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm?
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees

Just disappear
I care for you much too much
And when you're near, close to me, dear
We touch too much

The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That darling, it's getting me down
So on your mark, get set
Get out of town

Just disappear

We touch too much

Ella Fitzgerald,"I am dejected, I am depressed
Yet resurrected and sailing the crest
Why this elation, mixed with deflation?
What explanation, I am in love

Such conflicting questions rise
Around in my brain
Should I order cynanide or order champagne?

Oh, what is this sudden jolt?
I feel like a frightened colt
Just hit by a thunderbolt, I am in love

I knew the odds were against me before
I had no flair for flaming desire
But since the gods gave me you to adore
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire

So come and enlighten my days and never depart
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart
For I am wildly in love with you
And so in need of a stampede of love

I knew the odds were against me before
I had no flair for flaming desire
But since the gods gave me you to adore
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire

Ella Fitzgerald,"In the still of the night
As I gaze from of my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you

Do you love me
As I love you?
Are you my life to be
My dream come true?
Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight?

Like the moon growing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night

In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night
Ella Fitzgerald,"As Dorothy Parker once said
To her boyfriend, ""fare thee well""
As Columbus announced, when he knew he was bounced
""It was swell, Isabel, swell""

As Abelard said to Eloise
""Don't forget to drop a line to me, please""
As Juliet cried, in her Romeo's ear
""Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
It was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her love down

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.

Can't you see that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.

Too misty,
And too much

Ella Fitzgerald,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance",A Fine Romance [*]
Ella Fitzgerald,"How long, baby how long,
Has that evening train been gone?
How long, how how long, baby how long?

Went to the station, didn't see no train.
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue.
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

Don't have no money for to ride the train.
I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again.

Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs

Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

To visit St. Thomas
And then at Jamaica we'll dock

It's all so peaceful
On the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
Ya better chase your cares away!!
Sing Hallelujah, c'mon get happy
Get ready for the judgment day",Get Happy
Ella Fitzgerald,"It seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe
He got a smile that make the lilac want to grow
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by

Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare
Soon he kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Trouble fly away and life is easy go

Does he love me good? That's all I has to know
Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe
Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe
Little Joe, little Joe, little Joe",Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe
Ella Fitzgerald,"I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to feel low-down
I gotta right to hang around
Down around the river
A certain gal in this old town
Keeps draggin' my poor (old) heart around
All I see, for me is - misery
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan and sigh
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
I know the deep blue sea
Will soon be callin' me
It must be love - say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues",I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues
Ella Fitzgerald,"It was written in the stars 
What was written in the stars shall be 
It was written in the skies 
That the heart and not the eyes shall see 

And so whether it bring joy 
Whether it bring woe 
It shall be done 
Now suddenly I know 
You are the one 

Here as in a daydream 
By my side you stand 
Here with my tomorrows 
In your hands 

It was written high above 
That I have to have your love 
Or I'll never be free 
And cloudy though the day be 
Crazy though I may be 
What the stars foretold shall be 

Here as in a daydream 
By my side you stand 
Here with my tomorrows 
In your hands 

It was written high above 
That I have to have your love 
Or I'll never be free 
And cloudy though the day be 
Crazy though I may be 
What the stars foretold shall be 

And so shall it be",It Was Written in the Stars
Ella Fitzgerald,"The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you`re older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing`s on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it`s final inning,
Don`t know what happened
It`s all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you`ve been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you`re on to -
But fools will be fools and where`s he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It`s lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There`s just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away . . .

Ella Fitzgerald,"It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place except you and me
So set 'em' up, Joe
I got a little story you ought to know

We're drinking, my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I got the routine
So drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad
I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad

I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it
But, buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things to say
And if I'm gloomy
You simply gotta listen to me
Until it's all talked away

Well, that's how it goes
And, Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
So thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear

This torch that I've found
Must be drowned or it soon might explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

Ella Fitzgerald,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Ella Fitzgerald,"When the sun comes out
And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they did before

That ol' storm broke out
And my man
Gal walked off and left me in the rain
Though he's
She's gone I doubt
If he'll
She'll stay away for good,I'd stop livin' if he/she should

Love is funny, it's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

Til that sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour, it may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in
When the sun comes out",When the Sun Comes Out
Ella Fitzgerald,"The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadowland toward a closing door
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you",Days of Wine and Roses
Ella Fitzgerald,"Though you vacation in Hawaii
Or go to Switzerland to ski
When you're scanning the snow-covered mountain
Or fanning yourself by the sea
Don't dream of anybody but me

Though you may fly the Scottish Highlands
Or take a trip to some isle near Napoli
When you're whistling ""The Campbells Are Coming""
Or humming ""The Isle Of Capri""
Don't dream of anybody but me

In a cafe on the Rhine
Any place along the line
I'll forgive you when a stranger
Puts your little heart in danger
If his face resembles mine

When a guy at a mike in a nightclub
Begins bellowing something off-key
Won't even mind if suddenly he reminds you of me

No matter where you care to roam
Doesn't even matter whom you choose to see
Whenever your head hits that pillow
Whatever the hour may be
Don't dream of anybody but me
Don't dream of anybody but me
Don't dream of anybody but me",Don't Dream of Anybody But Me

Ella Fitzgerald,"Everyday brings change, and the world puts on a new face
Sudden things rearrange, and this whole world seems like a new place
Oh yeah, secretly I been tailing you
Like a fox that prays on a rabbit
Had to get you and so I knew
I had to learn your ways and habits
Oh, you were the catch that I was after
But I looked up and I was in your arms and I knew that I was captured

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Any time the hunter gets captured by the game

I had to lay such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
Love hit me like a sudden slap
One kiss and then I knew it
Oh, my plans didn't work out like I thought
'Cause I had laid my trap for you but it seems like I got caught

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Any time the hunter gets captured by the game",The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game
Ella Fitzgerald,"I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before 
Between the two of us guys 
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say 
When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself 
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine

Ella Fitzgerald,"What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a guy?
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, he'll never phone you
I'll never fall in love again

Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin
Oh, what music

I don't know just what it is, but it's great
They simply ruin it
Look at 'em doin' it
